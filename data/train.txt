what do you think about all the different diets that people go on ? __eou__ i don't think dieting is good for you . it's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . they don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? __eou__ sure , they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ how about drinking soda ? __eou__ many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . __eou__ and have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ i used to take vitamins every day , but i don't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ how do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ you might not believe this , but i used to be twice the size that i am now !
would you like to have some icecream ? i've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . i've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . __eou__ wow ! so many choices you have ! i wish i could , but i just can't . i'm on a diet to lose weight . __eou__ come on , just a bite . it doesn't really hurt to have just a bite . __eou__ i'd better not . please don't tempt me . please ! __eou__ gee ! you are really strong-willed . __eou__ you're damn right . i'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that i think is wrong . __eou__ well , i'd better not tempt you . otherwise , if i give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk .

would you like a piece of birthday cake ? __eou__ no , thanks , i'll pass . it looks very tempting though . __eou__ i thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ? __eou__ it is . i'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it . __eou__ a diet ? what for ? you are in great shape . __eou__ i went to the doctor the other day . my cholesterol is up . __eou__ oooo . this sounds serious . __eou__ not too serious . but he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down .

mom , i want to get a motorcycle . is that all right with you ? __eou__ you mean a murder cycle ? did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ? __eou__ mom ! i'll wear a helmet and i'll drive sane . i promise . __eou__ i'll tell you what . you can get a motorcycle on one condition . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ you spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an emt trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month . __eou__ and after that ? __eou__ after that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , i mean motorcycle .

do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ? __eou__ yes , g stands for general audiences , pg means parental guidance suggested , r is restricted to audiences under 18 and x means explicit content . __eou__ does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ? __eou__ remember when we were kids ? theaters wouldn't let kids in to pg moves without a parent . __eou__ i remember that i never saw an x moves even displayed . __eou__ now with video rentals it's all a personal matter . __eou__ yea , i never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either . __eou__ now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .

who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? __eou__ i did . why ? __eou__ didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ? __eou__ no , i didn't . i'm sorry . it won't happen again .

is there anything i can do for you ? __eou__ i'm trying to choose a gift . __eou__ did you have anything particular in mind ? __eou__ no , but i'd like to get something typical in this region . __eou__ well , we have some handmade products . let me show you some . __eou__ they're quite nice . but i'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive . __eou__ about how much were you planning to spend ? __eou__ no more than one hundred yuan . __eou__ oh , in that case . this one is ok . __eou__ oh ! it's perfect . i think i'll take it . would you wrap it , please ? __eou__ ok . wait for a moment , please .
this is the house i want to rent . __eou__ could you tell me the advantages of it ? __eou__ no problem . first , it's comfortable and cozy . second , it has a lovely view of the city . third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . __eou__ there is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? __eou__ 200 dollars per week . __eou__ in my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . __eou__ it certainly is . but to tell you the truth , the room is so large that i can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . __eou__ your intention is good , but i still can't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . __eou__ don't you think i can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where i work ? __eou__ i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? __eou__ twice a week for work and once for shopping . __eou__ in my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . __eou__ that's true . ok , i will think about it .
chinese tea is famous all over the world . i want to buy several boxes . __eou__ there are various kinds of tea in china . it depends on the taste and effect . __eou__ well , i do not know chinese tea at all . __eou__ this is green tea , you can drink it in summer . it can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs . __eou__ sounds interesting . what about this ? __eou__ it is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion . __eou__ what's this ? it smells fragrant . __eou__ it is jasmine tea of high quality . it is fragrant and has a pleasant taste . __eou__ i will take the jasmine tea . could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? it is a gift for my friend . __eou__ no problem . wait for a moment .
can i help you ? __eou__ i'd like to buy some chinese-style cakes . could you recommend me some ? __eou__ certainly . what about moon cake ? it's typical chinese food . __eou__ moon cakes ? what is that ? __eou__ the moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . that's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . __eou__ sounds very interesting . i'll buy some to family people . __eou__ all the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , cantonese style and suzhou style . __eou__ what's the difference between these two styles ? __eou__ the skin of cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . __eou__ get me some of each . __eou__ ok , here you are .
excuse me , i have something to trouble you . __eou__ yes ? i'll be very glad if i could be of any help to you . __eou__ an hour ago , i bought this vase with my tourist . __eou__ oh , yes . i remember it clearly . is there anything wrong with it ? __eou__ i'm afraid so . we found this crack on the bottom when i went back to my hotel . __eou__ oh , how awful ! let me have a look , i'm terribly sorry . it was most thoughtless of me . would you excuse me , please ? __eou__ oh , it's quite all right , i suppose . it can't be helped sometimes . __eou__ it's very kind of you to say so . how about changing another one for you ? __eou__ all right . thank you . __eou__ just a minute , please . i won't be long . i'm sure this one is perfect . you may examine it carefully . __eou__ oh , yes , it is . i'll take this one . __eou__ i'm very sorry for any inconvenience i've caused you . __eou__ well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
ann , it's terrible ! __eou__ what's up ? __eou__ look , this is a pimple ! __eou__ oh , i think it is . __eou__ how come ? __eou__ i think it's because of your bad habits ! __eou__ i have no bad habit . i sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . i have done a lot . __eou__ i know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and i think this is your problem . __eou__ i wasn't aware of that ! __eou__ you should do better later .
hello ? can you give me a tow ? my tour car's stranded . __eou__ sure . where are you ? __eou__ i'm on highway 1-75 going near exit 46 . __eou__ what kind of car ? __eou__ it's a blue nissan minivan . __eou__ where are you going to ? __eou__ the closest garage . what's the charge ? __eou__ you are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate . __eou__ how long will it take ? __eou__ about 20 to 30 minutes . __eou__ thanks .

tommy played truant today . his teacher called me this morning . __eou__ where did he go ? __eou__ i've asked him , but he won't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . __eou__ like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . __eou__ stop , stop ... we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . __eou__ pay him ? but he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . __eou__ in that way , i'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ? __eou__ that's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ? __eou__ that's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
what is this big box at the front door ? __eou__ oh . i don't know what to do . i joined this club a long time ago and i didn't read the fine print . __eou__ what did you get yourself into ? __eou__ i didn't realize that i have to buy something from them every six months . __eou__ so , what's in the box ? a fridge ? __eou__ it's a curio cabinet . the only thing is i don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes . __eou__ i guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you ! __eou__ don't rub it in . where am i going to put this huge thing ?
what's up ? you sound a little down in dumps . __eou__ i quarreled with my roommate last night . he is really stubborn . __eou__ calm down ! shouting won ’ t help ? __eou__ he is really outrageous . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog , so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i couldn't fall asleep , because brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me . __eou__ what ? he can't do this to you . __eou__ well , he did it anyway . then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ i shouted it back of course . __eou__ hold it , mike . you won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? you worked it all up till now . why not wait until you cool down a bit ? __eou__ what would you do if you were in my shoes ? __eou__ just stay cool . you know . when you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . __eou__ no way , kate . i mean it's just not my fault . __eou__ i know . it wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . and after that , you can casually mention the problem . i am sure he will cooperate . __eou__ i am too angry to do that .

what can i do for you ? __eou__ i'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . could you make a recommendation for me ? __eou__ i'd like to . how do you like the hat ? __eou__ it's not special . it can be seen everywhere . __eou__ how about the umbrella ? it's made of wood and paper . it's very beautiful . __eou__ it's interesting . let me see . __eou__ do you like it ? __eou__ yes , how much is it ? __eou__ fifty yuan . __eou__ ok , i'll take it .

i need some flowers for my girlfriend . __eou__ no problem . would you like some artificial carnations ? __eou__ oh , no . carnations are not very elegant . artificial flowers have no passion . __eou__ how much did you want to spend ? __eou__ money is no object . __eou__ our most elegant flower is golden lily . __eou__ i will take ten . __eou__ do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? they are equally popular now . __eou__ of course . can i have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? __eou__ yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge . __eou__ that's ok . here is the address .

mom , look ! my first piggy bank and it still has money in it ! __eou__ that is a blast from the past . __eou__ remember when i used to beg you to break it so i could go buy ice cream ? __eou__ yes . you sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars . __eou__ thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom . __eou__ but what are you going to do with that pig ? __eou__ i think i'm going to keep it as a monument to what i've learned about money . __eou__ who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top ceo in a major corporation !
tomorrow i will be the new owner of all dad's assets . __eou__ it still feels really strange to me . __eou__ i know . i miss him terribly . __eou__ how does it feel to be in charge of so much money ? __eou__ i thought i would feel like i was in the lap of luxury . __eou__ i guess you could choose that if you wanted . __eou__ no , i think i will run things much the same way that dad did . __eou__ dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone !

can you believe her ? she is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . __eou__ tell me about it . if i was as small as her , i wouldn't think about going on a diet . __eou__ me too . but what are we going to do ? i have been on 4 different diets and i can't seem to lose weight . __eou__ that's because you don't exercise . if you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . __eou__ what do you know ? you are over weight too . __eou__ i'm not on a diet though . __eou__ i know . but i don't have someone to diet with . if we help each other and motivate each other , then i think we can lose some weight . __eou__ i like ice cream too much though . __eou__ c'mon . you'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . __eou__ it does sound appealing . __eou__ it's a great idea . i can't believe i didn't think of this earlier . going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . __eou__ okay . i'm in . let's do it . __eou__ great . i'll get our plan started right away . __eou__ can we start tomorrow though ?

can you show me how to use chopsticks ? __eou__ with pleasure . __eou__ oh , it is not easy to learn ! __eou__ i think you are a quick learner . __eou__ well , i don't think i can manage with it . __eou__ in that case , shall i ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ? __eou__ that's good , thank you .
may i help you ? __eou__ is this the right counter for gloves ? __eou__ yes , madam . what sort of gloves do you want ? __eou__ well , let me see some of each . __eou__ certainly . what size do you take ? __eou__ six and a quarter , i believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure . __eou__ i think a six is your size . how do you like these ? i can recommend them , they're very reliable . __eou__ very well , i'll take these two .
may i take your order now ? __eou__ yes , i'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please . __eou__ how would you like your eggs ? __eou__ hard-boiled , please . __eou__ and your toast , light or dark ? __eou__ dark , please . __eou__ now or later ? __eou__ later will do . __eou__ will there be anything else ? __eou__ no , that's all . thanks . __eou__ one hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow . __eou__ that's right . __eou__ just a moment , please .
may i have a reservation ? __eou__ yes , of course . __eou__ i've got three guests today . we'd like a table next to the window . __eou__ all right . your name , please . __eou__ i'm chen liang . __eou__ chen liang , a table for four . and when are you coming ? __eou__ we may come at 6:30 p . m . __eou__ ok . we look forward to seeing you . goodbye . __eou__ goodbye .
what are you doing ? __eou__ i'm watching tv . __eou__ are there any good programs on tv ? __eou__ tingling is on tv . __eou__ which channel is it ? __eou__ channel 8 . __eou__ it doesn't seem quite interesting . would you change the channel ?
i think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . __eou__ why ? it doesn't make sense . if we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . __eou__ hmm maybe you're right . but i can't stand all this green carpet here . and besides , i know how to paint . i will just cover everything with drop cloth . i won't get anything on the floor . __eou__ are you sure ? __eou__ yes , i'm sure i've done a lot of house painting in my life . and my mother was very picky . if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . so i learned to be very careful . __eou__ alright . then maybe we can do the floor first . these wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . and me too — — i can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . but how can we get it out ? do we have to hire someone ? __eou__ absolutely not . we can remove the carpet ourselves . carpet is held down with carpet nails . you just need to pull it hard and it will come up . __eou__ great . then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . right ? __eou__ yes . but we should hire someone for that . that will probably be expensive . and it has to be done right . __eou__ and then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . __eou__ sure . if we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . i can get all the carpet out this weekend .
hello , is that the peace restaurant ? __eou__ yes . may i help you ? __eou__ yes . i'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . can you arrange it for us ? __eou__ just a minute . i'll check if there is any availability . i'm sorry , sir . there isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . would you like to make a reservation at that time ? __eou__ let me see . it seems a little late . __eou__ usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time . __eou__ ok . i'll change the time to 8: 00 . __eou__ very good , sir . a table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . may i have your name , please ? __eou__ it's john . __eou__ thank you very much . bye .

you're right . watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . i like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast . __eou__ i agree . and it's very convenient . __eou__ have you ever heard of a movie rental company called netflix ? they send the movies directly to your house in the mail . __eou__ really ? that's great ! i'm going to try that next time . __eou__ yeah , but i wish they delivered video games too . then i would never leave my house !
good evening , saliva . what's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? what are you doing now ? __eou__ i am cooking now ! __eou__ are you good at cooking ? __eou__ i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant , so i have to practise cooking ! __eou__ it is a good idea . what dish are you cooking now ? ! __eou__ i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . have you ever tried steamed fish ? __eou__ yes , i have . but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . the fish is not well-done and too salty . __eou__ that's the case . i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . __eou__ i have the same idea as yours . __eou__ it's ok . please have a taste of it . __eou__ thank you . oh , it's very delicious . __eou__ thank you for your praise . __eou__ besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? __eou__ i am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . __eou__ so many dishes . next friday week is my birthday . i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , ok ? __eou__ why not ? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ it's my pleasure .
alright , tell me what you think about this one . __eou__ don't you think it's a bit bright ? __eou__ yeah , maybe you're right . how about this outfit ? __eou__ that dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ? __eou__ no , i don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but i love the way it looks . i just want to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it's casual , yet sophisticated . __eou__ i like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . it's too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? __eou__ that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ? __eou__ that's a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__ thanks . you'd be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ? __eou__ yep . here it is . what do you think ? __eou__ that looks great . just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__ the leopard print sounds fabulous . ok , i'll take it .
can i borrow this magazine from you ? it's really interesting and i can't put it down . __eou__ i am sorry , but i can't lend it to you now , for i haven't finished reading it . if you don't mind , i can lend you some back numbers to you . __eou__ that would be very kind of you . by the way , is it a monthly magazine ? __eou__ no , it is a fortnightly . so , you see , i can get the new one quite soon .
boy , come here ! __eou__ yes , sir ! what can i do for you ? __eou__ bring me a cup of coffee , please . __eou__ will you have it strong or weak ? __eou__ i prefer strong .
won't you have some of this ? __eou__ yes , thanks . __eou__ it's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . __eou__ it's very good . how do you make it ? __eou__ i use a special dressing and homemade catsup . __eou__ this salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day . __eou__ i'm glad you like it . __eou__ you americans usually have nutritious food . __eou__ oh , but chinese food is so delicious . i wish i knew how to cook chinese food . do you follow recipes ? __eou__ we use different spices but few people use recipes . they learn to cook by experience . __eou__ i always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . she was a great cook . she would make clam chowder and cornbread every sunday night .
here , let me get the door for you . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ do you need a hand with that ? __eou__ actually , i could use some help . thank you so much . __eou__ don't worry about it .
doctor , my child is nine years old , and i recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school . __eou__ is he doing very well at school ? __eou__ he is doing ok , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies . __eou__ what's his problem ? __eou__ this may be complicated . but i think he may need to build up his self-esteem . __eou__ how can his he do that ? __eou__ there are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem .
nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . so i am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . __eou__ what you said is true . but the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . for example , to make more movie ccds , so people will spend money buying them . __eou__ but it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . __eou__ yes . take myself for example . i seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean i no longer see films ; instead , i see films at home-watching ccds .
there are many new kinds of newspapers . i find it hard to choose among them . which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? __eou__ i'd recommend you the morning paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . __eou__ what's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? __eou__ i think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . it also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . many people are now speculating in the stock market . __eou__ i can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years .
good morning , mrs . smith . __eou__ good morning ! can you help me , please ? i'm looking for some books for my mother . __eou__ what kind of books does she like ? __eou__ she's very fond of detective stories .

there are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . but only a few of them are influential world-wide . __eou__ you have hit the point . it's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . __eou__ but i think digest is supposed to be the top one . its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . it's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . __eou__ to my mind , the success of digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue .

what kind of films do you like best ? __eou__ i like feature films best . how about you ? __eou__ i don't like feature films . i think sometimes it loses contact with reality . i like to see some documentary films . what kind of feature films do you like best ? __eou__ i always like to see the oldies , like the sound of music , gone with the wind . they are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot . __eou__ you are sort of romantic .

it's located in the suburbs ? well even though that sounds like a steal , i really want something downtown . __eou__ ok . well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . __eou__ i know , that's my problem . what do you think i should do ? __eou__ well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . __eou__ oh , great idea !
well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? the listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro . __eou__ wow , that would be very convenient . how much is the rent ? __eou__ it says it's $ 1600 . but if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . __eou__ that definitely sounds like a steal . i think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . __eou__ that's true . i know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there .

do you take in students ? i've been told you might have a vacant room . __eou__ yes . if you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available . __eou__ how much are you asking ? __eou__ 800 yuan a month . __eou__ could i have a look at it , please ? __eou__ sorry , but i'm on my way out now . could you come back in an hour ?

let's see . i had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my pizza was £ 8.25 . __eou__ i had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 . __eou__ so that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you . __eou__ yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? __eou__ yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us . __eou__ so now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and i need to pay £ 22.50 . __eou__ and i had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . and you had coffee which is £ 2 . __eou__ and is that all ? __eou__ yes , this is everything on the list . __eou__ so now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . is that correct ? __eou__ yes , that's exactly it . how much tip shall we give the waiter ? __eou__ i think £ 5 would be good .
good evening . __eou__ good evening . we've a reservation for a table for four . my name is tim . __eou__ let me check the list . yes , we do have a reservation under mr . tim . __eou__ but there is a change in the number of people . there are seven of us . three of my friends are coming soon . __eou__ it doesn't matter . follow me , please . what do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ? __eou__ well , it's a window table that we've booked . __eou__ i'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats . __eou__ oh , i see . we'll have to make up with the center one . __eou__ thank you for your understanding , mr . tim . __eou__ if a mr . wu comes to look for me , just take him here . __eou__ yes , i will .
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . __eou__ we should plan to move out of here before july . i'm tired of living in apartments . __eou__ i know , dear . i am too . but we've just been too busy to look for a house . __eou__ we need to find a good realtor . __eou__ not necessary . if we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ realtors always get a commission . if the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . __eou__ but doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles . __eou__ yes , that's often true . but you have to pay them . __eou__ i still think we should have a realtor . we're new in this country . we don't know all the laws of buying a house . and also , the realtor will inspect the house . he can tell us if the house has any problems . __eou__ of course we need a house inspector . but we can hire an inspector on our own . as for the legal problems , i have friends . they can help us . __eou__ so how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ it takes a little more time . we have to check the ads in the paper . probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . __eou__ and doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? __eou__ sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . it's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . __eou__ why ? __eou__ that is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . he will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ hmm . it all sounds very complicated . __eou__ it is . but buying a house is very important . so it takes time . that's why we haven't done it yet . it's very troublesome . __eou__ i want to look in the papers today . maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ all right . i'll buy a newspaper when i go to the drugstore .
where to , madam ? __eou__ grand central station , please . i want to catch a 6 p . m . train . __eou__ i think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam . __eou__ here is the grand central station . __eou__ thank you . how much is the fare ? __eou__ the meter reads 9.15 dollars . __eou__ here you are . keep the change . __eou__ thank you .
good evening , sir . welcome to our restaurant . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ do you have a reservation ? __eou__ yes , i do . __eou__ may i have your name , please ? __eou__ yes , it's mr . brown . __eou__ mr . brown . we were expecting you . this way , please . will this table be fine ? __eou__ oh , this is just fine . __eou__ please take a seat . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ here is the menu .
would you like to have a piece of cake ? __eou__ no , thank you . i'm on a diet . __eou__ why ? you're not fat . __eou__ i'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so i must have a slender figure . __eou__ women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . __eou__ i'm afraid the judges do not think so . all the beauty contests are for slim girls only . __eou__ well . there's a beauty contest in thailand just for fat beauties . __eou__ how much do they weigh ? __eou__ all the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . __eou__ but i'm not fat enough to enter that contest .
excuse me . could you tell me the way to the star hotel ? __eou__ yes . go down the main road . you can't miss it . __eou__ how long will it take me to get there ? __eou__ it's only about a five-minute walk . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you're welcome .
where to , sir . __eou__ to this place , please . __eou__ star hotel . ok . __eou__ how long does it take to get to the hotel ? __eou__ about 20 minutes . __eou__ here's the hotel . __eou__ how much is the fare ? __eou__ that's 10 dollars .
good morning , madam . i think i'm lost here . the place i want to go to is a hotel called the hilton . __eou__ do you know in which area ? __eou__ no , i am sorry i have no idea . i am a stranger here . __eou__ i see . well , do you know anything near the hotel ? __eou__ oh , yes . my friend told me the hotel was near the central railway station . __eou__ then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the central railway station . __eou__ can you show me where the central railway station is on this map ? __eou__ ok .
hello , are you interested in this honda ? __eou__ hi , i am just looking . __eou__ it's a good car . __eou__ what year is it ? __eou__ 1999 . __eou__ how about the mileage ? __eou__ 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . __eou__ what do you mean 7b __eou__ highway miles are not as bad as local miles . they do not hurt car as much . __eou__ oh , why such a high mileage ? __eou__ the owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line . __eou__ okay . does this car have a warranty ? __eou__ one month . __eou__ how do i make sure i am not buying a junk ? __eou__ you'll check it out anyway you want . you can take it to a garage . __eou__ how much is it ? __eou__ $ 5,900 . __eou__ i'll have to think about it . __eou__ leave your phone number , and i will give you a call if the price gets reduced . __eou__ okay .
what else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? __eou__ we need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . __eou__ i'm the painter . you can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . that will probably be pretty expensive too . having good curtains made isn't cheap . __eou__ you mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? __eou__ absolutely not . the windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . so that will take a while . maybe a month or so . __eou__ while the curtains are being made , i can start having people look at the kitchen . i can't stand that old kitchen . i won't be able to cook there . i don't want to use that electric stove . __eou__ we need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . i believe in portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . i will look in the yellow pages . i'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . __eou__ i agree . the colors must be soft and pleasant . you should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . __eou__ me ? cook our dinners ? hah ! you will be cooking , dear . you will cook . __eou__ no , i don't think so . i'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . __eou__ well , i suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . so you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . __eou__ and you'll have to sell your motorcycle . and your cameras . right ? __eou__ maybe i'll cook once or twice a week . how is that ? __eou__ four times might be enough . not once or twice .
hi , mike . i am going to move on the first of next month . __eou__ congratulations ! so , have you started planning your move ? __eou__ yes , i am trying to find good movers now . do you know any ? __eou__ not really . __eou__ what did you do for your last move ? __eou__ since i did not have much staff , i asked my cousin to help me out . __eou__ oh . that's very nice of him . __eou__ yeah , it was . but i still have some information that i collected last time , and if you want , i will give it to you . __eou__ yes , please .
miss , may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . __eou__ it's because of the view . __eou__ oh ! i see . can you show me the location of block i ? __eou__ sure . please take a look at the model of the building . nice garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled block i and block ii . block i has a total of thirty-eighth floors . the thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . there are four units in one floor . the sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . the size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . __eou__ how many elevators are there ? __eou__ there are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . __eou__ how about the car-park space ? __eou__ there are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . __eou__ any other facilities ? __eou__ sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . there are two swimming pools . one is olympic standard size and the other one is for children . also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . __eou__ what is the completion date ? __eou__ the completion date will be july 1st 2007 . __eou__ how about the price and the bank mortgage ? __eou__ please check up the price list . the average unit price is five million hong kong dollars . there are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . __eou__ how many payment methods are there ? __eou__ it's all written on the brochure price list . i believe there will be one right for you . please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . __eou__ thank you . i think i have to talk to the bank representatives . thank you for your help . __eou__ you're welcome .
you know , i'm a pretty laid-back person . i don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . for example , i like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal . __eou__ i totally agree . i really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and i don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . my last roommate was a drama queen . every time i forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it . __eou__ yeah , i really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . it's important that we don't get on each other's nerves . __eou__ that's right . we should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another .
excuse me , could you tell me which bus i should take to go to the railway station ? __eou__ i think you'd better take the no . 16 bus . it can take you right there . __eou__ how often dose this bus go there ? __eou__ every fifteen minutes . __eou__ i really can't wait that long . are there any other buses that can take me there ? __eou__ the no . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . you may take it . __eou__ where can i find the bus ? __eou__ the bus stop is not far from here . go straight on and you can easily find it . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ you are welcome .
good morning , madam . what can i do for you ? ! __eou__ i'd like a coffee please . __eou__ certainly , madam . what kind of coffee would you like ? __eou__ what have you got ? __eou__ well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and americano . __eou__ goodness me ! so many choices ! i think i'll have a cappuccino please . __eou__ here you are . you'll find the sugar just over there .
hi steve , it's nice to meet you . i hear that you're looking for an apartment , and i just rented a two-bedroom downtown . i'm looking for a compatible roommate . __eou__ great , i'm looking for a place right in that area . your apartment sounds ideal . __eou__ alright . so tell me , how would you describe yourself ? __eou__ i'm pretty social and outgoing , and i like making new friends . but i'm not a party animal , and i like to keep the apartment clean . __eou__ i'm like that too . i like to invite friends over sometimes , but i don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment .
what is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ irish coffee is my favorite . but i'm not particular on it . __eou__ all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ not very often . making coffee is a bit troublesome . most of the time , i just buy takeout at starbucks . and also , i quite like instant coffee . __eou__ i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ exactly . nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . people love it all over the world . __eou__ i agree . i heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . is that true ? __eou__ yes . no doubt about that . for us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . i heard chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ no , we don't , especially the elder people . but more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . __eou__ i suppose so . that's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in china now .
excuse me , is this where i can catch a bus to the museum ? __eou__ yes , you're at the right stop . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ are you new here ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ have you got small change ? they require exact fare . __eou__ yes , i've got some coins . how much is the fare ? __eou__ one yuan . when you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box . __eou__ i see . how often does this bus run at this time of day ? __eou__ it runs every ten minutes . oh , here comes the bus .

here we are on the train . __eou__ yes , we are travelling at rush hours . it could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . __eou__ i hear many people have cars . __eou__ yes , almost all the families have their own cars . __eou__ why don't they drive ? isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? __eou__ well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . __eou__ i see .

let's go to the cinema by bus . __eou__ better take the subway . it's far quicker and more convenient . __eou__ ok , it will be a new experience for me . __eou__ we have a rather comprehensive subway system here . you can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy . __eou__ where do we pay the fare ? __eou__ just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket . __eou__ do i have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? __eou__ no , you don't have to . here comes the train . be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .

i like the honda accord you showed me before . i think it's more practical for my needs . __eou__ alright , sir . you are making a good choice . honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new accord . __eou__ what does it come with standard ? __eou__ on all our new cars , the standards include __eou__ cruise control ? i don't like that . __eou__ why not , sir ? __eou__ i think it's dangerous . what if i can't turn it off ? __eou__ well , sir , i know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . but honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . __eou__ i wish it didn't have cruise control . my wife doesn't like it either . __eou__ you know , sir , you don't have to use it . you can turn it on or off . if you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . __eou__ i suppose . and what about the sunroof ? is that standard ? __eou__ no , the sunroof is optional , sir . __eou__ i see .
for me , now an important question to buy an accord is the time when i can get this car . i need a new car rather soon . __eou__ well , i can say that the new models will be here in august . if you order one now , we will have it for you in august . __eou__ that's good enough , i think . what colors does the new accord come in ? __eou__ we have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . these are the standard colors . of course you could specially order from various other colors too . __eou__ my brother has last year's accord . and his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . i really like that color . i wonder if i can get that color on my accord . __eou__ i know the color you mean . is this it , sir ? __eou__ yes , i think that's it . can i get that on the accord ? __eou__ yes , you can . that color is very popular with honda buyers . so we've kept it available . __eou__ well , i think i want to order the new accord then . it looks like an excellent car . __eou__ you have made a good choice , sir . i drive an accord myself . they are very solidly built machines , very reliable . __eou__ yes , i know . i think honda is the most reliable car on the road . i would never change to anything else . the honda i have now almost never has service problems . it runs smooth as silk . __eou__ alright , sir . i will get the paperwork ready for you . just a moment .

you are an early bird , tom . what do you do in the morning then ? __eou__ exercise . the morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . we should not pass them up easily . seize the time and do something useful . __eou__ so , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . where do you exercise ? __eou__ usually , i run to the black bamboo park as a warm-up . admission is free . then i start my activities . __eou__ do you do the same exercises every day ? __eou__ no , i've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . i alternate them over the weekdays . sometimes , when i find myself in a bad state , i will simply idle about in the park . __eou__ why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? __eou__ it's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it's interesting to join them . __eou__ oh , yes . singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .
can i help you ? __eou__ yes , i need to buy a computer for this semester . i was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . __eou__ well , you heard right . you can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . we have great discounts for students . __eou__ i don't know much about computers . but i know i want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . and i need a printer . __eou__ well , first let's consider your computer . here , for example , is a system i highly recommend-the power macintosh g3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . __eou__ is that a lot ? sixty-four ? __eou__ yes , it is . it should be enough for any student needs you might have . what department are you in ? __eou__ history . __eou__ well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . i recommend the corel word perfect program for word processing . we can talk about software later . let's talk about your hardware first . we have a special deal on right now . i should tell you about it , as it only goes until next tuesday . if you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a power macintosh g3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . __eou__ thirty percent ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ wow . that's really good . and you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? __eou__ yes . it's an excellent system . __eou__ hmm . hey , wait . this has an apple on it . is this an apple computer ? __eou__ yes , it's a macintosh . it's apple . mcintosh and apple are the same thing . __eou__ i don't want macintosh . i want pc . __eou__ i'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells macintosh equipment . __eou__ what ? are you serious ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ but nobody uses macintosh ! __eou__ that's not true . most of the students and professors in the university here use macintosh . they find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . may i ask where you're from ? __eou__ yes , i'm from taiwan . __eou__ well , i know that in most asian countries apple is not very popular . but here in america , especially in universities and publishing companies , apple is very commonly used . __eou__ but i need a computer that can handle writing in chinese . __eou__ there are several chinese writing programs you can use with macintosh . chinese is no problem for apple . __eou__ hmm . i think i should ask some of my friends for advice before i make a decision . i'm sorry . __eou__ no , don't be sorry . it's reasonable to ask your friends . but believe me , most of the students here in the university-asian students included-most of them use apple . __eou__ well , thanks for your advice . i will probably come back later . __eou__ you're very welcome . here is my card , if you need any help .
okay . this trail looks the best . it's a little steep . but i'm sure it will be alright . __eou__ well . you're the tour guide , i'll follow you . __eou__ ... what a stink . this place stinks like rotten eggs . __eou__ that's sulphur you can smell . the whole of taiwan is a volcanic region . that's why taiwan has so many hot springs . it's volcanic activity.the sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . __eou__ suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . let's hike a little faster ...

excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the cross bakery building ? __eou__ the cross bakery building ? oh sure . you're actually walking in the opposite direction . __eou__ oh , you're kidding ! i thought i was heading east . __eou__ no , east is the other direction . to get to the bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to broadway . when you get to the intersection of broadway and elm , you hang a left . go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left . __eou__ okay , let me see if i've got that . i need to go down elm until i hit broadway , then i make a left and the building is on my left hand side . is that right ? __eou__ yeah , you've got it . do you want me to show you the way ? __eou__ thanks for the offer , but i think i've got it . hopefully , i won't get lost again on my way there !

i often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . __eou__ annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . i think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . __eou__ although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . if the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . __eou__ the skateboard does not pollute the air , either . it can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk .
have you got any outdoor interests ? __eou__ yes . my only recreation is skateboarding . __eou__ oh , i know it . it is included in extreme sports . i think it's too dangerous for me . __eou__ maybe . but it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . i'm getting to like the game more and more .

in 1986 , a new zealander hackett popularized bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . this sport is very challenging . it is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . the timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . no wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . __eou__ you see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . the wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . they do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__ entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__ a young french fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , " when i fastened the cord and walked to the platform , i was extremely nervous . when i looked down , i was nervous even more . if the cord had broken , i would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . however , i knew my worries were unwanted . i was afraid if i retreated others might say something about me . i had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . i only felt wind wiring at my ears . my body rapidly descended . i thought that after only seven or eight seconds i was rebounded to upper air by the cord . in fact it was 30 seconds . maybe because of my nervousness , i only felt seven or eight seconds . when rebounding to the high altitude , i felt a sudden sense of relief . i did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . " __eou__ it is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable '

would you please weigh this letter to see what the postage is ? __eou__ do you want to send it by ordinary or registered mail ? __eou__ by ordinary air mail , please . __eou__ anything of value in it ? __eou__ a postal order for four hundred dollars . __eou__ in that case , you'd better have it registered . __eou__ will i be informed when my friend gets the letter ? __eou__ yes , when your friend gets it , he'll sign a receipt , which will be sent to you by mail . then you can be sure it's been received . __eou__ all right , i'll have it registered , then .

excuse me , i'm looking for your casual short-sleeved shirts . can you tell me where those are ? __eou__ right over here , sir . what-size do you wear ? __eou__ medium . __eou__ these here are all mediums . __eou__ thank you . i think i'll take this one , and these pants as well . they're presents for a friend . __eou__ shall i gift-wrap them for you , sir ? __eou__ yes , please .
it's hot today , shall we go for a dip at the beach ? __eou__ that's a good idea . let's bring our trunks and towels . __eou__ would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ? __eou__ i'd prefer the pool . __eou__ ok . let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room . __eou__ what style do you use ? __eou__ well , i use breast stroke for long distance , crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun .
how do you usually part your hair ? __eou__ to the right . __eou__ ( the hair stylist cuts the customer's hair . ) almost done . i just have to even things up a bit . ( she shows the customer the results . ) will that do ? __eou__ looks good . __eou__ would you like a shave ? __eou__ no , thanks . __eou__ okay , let me brush you off . thank you very much for coming . __eou__ thank you .
can anyone tell me where i can buy the ingredients to make chinese food ? __eou__ there is a supermarket in kensington high street . i'll come and give you a hand . __eou__ that is good of you . __eou__ here , take one of these trolleys . what do you want exactly ? __eou__ i'm after things to stuff dumplings with , like chinese cabbage __eou__ the fruit and vegetables are over there . __eou__ pork . where's the meat counter ? __eou__ over there .
hello , sir . what can we do for you today ? __eou__ i'd like a trim . __eou__ would you like your hair washed as well ? __eou__ no , thanks . __eou__ okay , have a seat over here . how do you want it cut ? __eou__ cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . leave just a little over the ears . __eou__ all right .
i'm planning to buy a bicycle . as you are quite a cycling enthusiast , i wish you might give me some advice . __eou__ with pleasure , chap . but before i start , i need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__ my purposes are two-fold . on the one hand , i've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . on the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and i intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__ cycling during weekends ? do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? __eou__ does that make any difference ? __eou__ can't be greater . if you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . but if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ are they designed differently ? __eou__ a road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . it's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . in contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . you sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over .
this place is great . i'm surprised there are so many things here . __eou__ yes , but it takes a while to find things . it's not organized as carefully as a regular store . __eou__ what's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? __eou__ usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . the prices are very low . but you may find faulty products here too . __eou__ faulty products ? __eou__ yes . sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . so it's a good deal to buy it . __eou__ oh , that's easy for me . i think it's really a good deal . __eou__ yes . you can save a lot of money in this way . __eou__ that's great for me . look , children's clothes ! i'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . __eou__ why not buy the sweater ? it only costs 30 yuan . __eou__ yes , i'll take it . are there any jeans ? xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . i also need four pairs of slippers . __eou__ how many do you want to buy ? __eou__ i ought to make the most of it while i'm here , don't you think ? __eou__ you're right .
you're looking very well . __eou__ thank you . i try to keep in shape . __eou__ do you often exercise ? __eou__ yes , as long as i can find the time . i like swimming best . __eou__ what style of swimming do you like best ? __eou__ i like the back best . i am good at freestyle stroke , but i usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired . __eou__ i think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn . __eou__ i agree . i'm not good at it , either . can you swim ? how about going for a swim this saturday ? __eou__ oh , no . i am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim .
welcome to flash foot , sir . how can i help you ? __eou__ i'd like extra prints made of these photos . __eou__ do you have your negatives ? __eou__ yes . here they are . i've marked how many prints i want on each shot . __eou__ what size do you want the prints ? __eou__ four by six , except this one . i want a ten by thirteen print of this one . __eou__ okay , they'll be ready for you in an hour .

what is your policy on returns ? __eou__ if you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free . __eou__ sounds good . __eou__ that'll be $ 70 , please . will you be paying by cash or charge ? __eou__ charge . here's my card . __eou__ okay , sir , here you are . thank you very much . __eou__ thank you .
i'll try one of these on . ( the customer tries one of the shoes on . ) it's too big . it slides up and down my heel when i walk around . __eou__ well , let's try a size ten . ( he gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) looks like a perfect fit . __eou__ not really . it pinches my toes . __eou__ i'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in . __eou__ i don't know ... well , i guess i'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . __eou__ thank you , ma'am . it's been a pleasure doing business with you .
you look fresh recently . and .. what's your weight now ? __eou__ 110 pounds . __eou__ really ? congratulations ! that's really something beyond my imagination . how did you make it ? did you keep on a diet ? __eou__ no , you know i can't bear eating less . __eou__ then do the slim pills take effect on you ? __eou__ i've quit it already . i go to aerobics class everyday instead . __eou__ how's it going on ? __eou__ you see . i've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . __eou__ i'd better exercise my body too . my limbs are rusty now . __eou__ i don't think so . you look full of energy every day . time has stood still with you . __eou__ thank you .
good morning . welcome to time after time watches . __eou__ i'd like to buy a watch . __eou__ well , you've come to the right place . what kind of watch are you looking for ? __eou__ well , i'm not sure . let's see . how much is this one ? __eou__ hmm ... this rolex ? $ 1,000 . __eou__ oh . i don't think i can afford that . how about this one ? __eou__ this one is $ 500 . __eou__ wow . that's too much for me . don't you have anything cheaper ?
the total cost is 850 dollars . how would you like to pay ? __eou__ by credit card . __eou__ we take visa and master card . __eou__ do you take american express ? __eou__ no , we don't . __eou__ ok , i'll use my visa . here you are . __eou__ thank you ... please sign on the line .

let me suggest this one . it's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . __eou__ hmm . that's not too bad . does it have a stopwatch ? __eou__ uh , no . analog watches don't come with stopwatches . you'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . __eou__ oh . i see . where are your digital watches ? __eou__ right here . __eou__ i don't like this kind as much . never mind the stopwatch then . i'll take that other one . do you take checks ? __eou__ yes . make it out to time after time . __eou__ here you are . __eou__ thank you .

is this a duty-free shop ? __eou__ yes , sir . what can i do for you ? __eou__ i want to buy some specialties . can you recommend me some ? __eou__ sure . i strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter . __eou__ fine . they look nice . i will take both of them . __eou__ may i have a look at your passport , please ?
ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in china . it seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . __eou__ you got it ! in a sense , it has become a byword for chinese sport . __eou__ what do you think might be the source of its popularity ? __eou__ i think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . all you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... __eou__ and sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . __eou__ put it there ! in senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . __eou__ haha , these are very good inventions . all these speak the public's fondness for the sport __eou__ yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every tom , dick and jane in this developing country . no wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . __eou__ i know president hu into likes playing ping-pong . __eou__ actually , he excels in it . chairman mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . __eou__ i see . there was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ?
how do you feel ? __eou__ i like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . __eou__ here is the bigger size . __eou__ this one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ?
good evening , sir . what's your pleasure ? __eou__ give me a shot of whisky and soda . __eou__ with or without ice , sir ? __eou__ certainly without ice . ice will spoil the taste . __eou__ would you like to say ' when ' , please , sir . ( pouring soda ) __eou__ whoa , when . __eou__ enjoy your drink , sir .
she's a persian . she has papers and everything . not like a street dog . __eou__ cats chase mice , don't they ? __eou__ and bugs . they can catch anything . __eou__ do you have to walk a cat ? __eou__ no , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.thev ' re so smart . __eou__ but then you have to change the litter box . __eou__ it's better than picking up dog poop .
good evening , sir . what's your pleasure this evening ? your usual ? __eou__ yes . i'm going to stay with the same , a beer . __eou__ certainly , a beer . here you are , sir . __eou__ oh , darn . look what i've done . ( spill the drink ) __eou__ don't worry . i'll make you another on the house .
i'm getting so paunchy that i'm afraid i have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and i think i must go on a diet . __eou__ you are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy . __eou__ you know , i'm a compulsive overeater . i got to watch what i eat . __eou__ more physical exercise may help to keep your weight down . __eou__ you said it .
hi . can i help you ? __eou__ no , thanks . i ’ m just looking around . __eou__ okay . please let me know if you need any help . __eou__ thanks a lot .
is this where i can catch a bus to the theater ? __eou__ yes , but you can't get there with out a change . __eou__ which bus do i have to change ? __eou__ you have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . __eou__ i see . thank you .
morning , tom ! what are you doing over there ? learning to dance ? __eou__ can't you see ? i'm practicing tai chi ! __eou__ oh , my goodness . i'm sorry . but i don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . __eou__ i'm just a beginner . did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? __eou__ well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . __eou__ so , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? __eou__ to begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . __eou__ like this ? __eou__ good ! and then , the entire body . never incline your body forward or backward . take care to regulate the point of balance . place it at your waist . __eou__ did i do it right ? __eou__ no ! you should avoid sticking out your belly . keep your hip steady . don't swing . __eou__ what should i do with my legs then ? __eou__ oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . keep your knees bent a little . right , they should be rich in elasticity . move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . __eou__ fantastic ! i guess the same is true with the arms , right ? __eou__ exactly ! move your arms in a relaxed manner . well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . just keep them in a natural shape .
excuse me , i'm looking for the holiday inn . do you know where it is ? __eou__ sure . it's down this street on the left . __eou__ is it far from here ? __eou__ no , it's not far . __eou__ how far is it ? __eou__ about a mile and a half . __eou__ how long does it take to get there ? __eou__ 5 minutes or so . __eou__ is it close to the subway station ? __eou__ yes , it's very close . the subway station is next to the hotel . you can walk there . __eou__ thanks a lot .
excuse me , driver . does this bus go to the museum ? __eou__ yes , you get off at the square . __eou__ how long is the ride ? __eou__ well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy . __eou__ thank you.how much is the fare ? __eou__ drop 50 cents in the box , please . __eou__ would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? i am a stranger here . __eou__ sure . i will .
excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the today mall ? __eou__ yes , go down the fifth street . you won't miss it . __eou__ how long will it take me to get there ? __eou__ it's only about 10 minutes ' walk . __eou__ thank you very much .
now that you have learned kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? __eou__ i think , maybe , it takes a real kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , i am no more than a beginner . but i really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . __eou__ you mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? to some extent your idea holds water . kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . now we are apt to treat it as an art . __eou__ an art ! you have a good point there . so it is called martial arts in english . the chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . they even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__ thanks for your compliment ! perhaps the chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . do you know jin yong ? __eou__ i know he is a martial arts fiction writer . but i've read none of his novels . __eou__ all of his works have been translated into english . i recommend you to read one or two works of his . you'll get a general glimpse into chinese kung fu culture . when you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . __eou__ i see . they must have incorporated a series of chinese cultural elements . __eou__ yes , take philosophy , for instance . what makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? it's not enough only to be formidable . it also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__ so kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__ indeed , you're exactly right !
julia , look at me ! i'm gaining weight . how could i lose weight ? do you have any good ideas ? __eou__ since summer is coming , i think swimming is a good way for you to do . __eou__ are you sure ? __eou__ of course ! swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body . __eou__ really ? does swimming have other advantages ? __eou__ it could also help you increase vital capacity . __eou__ that ’ s great . okay , from now on i would swim three times a week . i hope i can get rid of the weight . __eou__ you will make it if you persist in it .
how may i help you , miss ? __eou__ i want to change my hairstyle . what would you suggest ? __eou__ would you like to have a perm ? __eou__ do you think it will suit me ? __eou__ oh , absolutely . __eou__ ok , i'll have it for a change .
hello . my name ’ s linda brown . what can i do for you today ? __eou__ hi . i ’ m tom peterson . i ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment . __eou__ certainly . first , i would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before i show you what we have . __eou__ that ’ s fine . __eou__ what price range are you interested in ? __eou__ well , between $ 350-400 a month . __eou__ okay . do you have a special location in mind ? __eou__ i ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . __eou__ when would you like to move in ? __eou__ as soon as possible . __eou__ how about the end of this month ? __eou__ fine . __eou__ are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? __eou__ i would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . __eou__ okay . here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . __eou__ thank you . this one looks nice . is it near the university ? __eou__ yes . it ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . __eou__ that ’ s good . i ’ d like to see it .
excuse me . i'm afraid i got lost . where am i on this map ? __eou__ we are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . __eou__ oh ! can i go from here to the zhongshan park ? __eou__ head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .
okay , i ’ ll take it . by the way , do you have delivery service ? __eou__ you don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service . __eou__ do you charge for delivery ? __eou__ wo will deliver the goods to you for free . __eou__ very good . could you deliver it to this address ? __eou__ sure . please write down your name and your phone number . __eou__ ok . can you tell me the delivery time ? __eou__ no later than tomorrow . __eou__ thanks .
hi , i'd like to have a beer . __eou__ hi , good evening . which kind of beer would you like ? __eou__ i'd like to try a local beer . what would you suggest ? __eou__ how about yanking beer ? it's very popular here . __eou__ sounds good . i'll take that .
good evening , sir . __eou__ good evening . i'll have a scotch . __eou__ yes , sir . straight or on the rocks ? __eou__ on the rocks , please .
hello , ma'am . can i help you ? __eou__ yes , please . i'd like a gin and tonic . __eou__ sure , ma'am . here you are . __eou__ thank you . how much is it ? __eou__ 25 yuan . __eou__ here's 30 . keep the change . __eou__ thank you very much , ma'am , but we don't take tips in china .
excuse me . i wonder if you could help me . i'm looking for the oriental pearl theater . __eou__ boy , you are lost . it's across town . __eou__ oh ! what bad luck ! how can i get to the theater ? __eou__ you can take a no . 12 bus here and then transfer to a no . 23 bus to get there .
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? __eou__ i don't think dieting is good for you . it's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ sure , they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . __eou__ how about drinking soda ? __eou__ many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . __eou__ that's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but i don't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ how do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ you might not believe this , but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
i'm sorry , but i didn't catch what you said . __eou__ i said , " do you want me to help you ? " __eou__ if you're sure you're not in a hurry , i can use a little help . __eou__ ok . would you like me to get you a cab ?
hi , mark . __eou__ hi , bill . i ’ d like to take the apartment i looked at yesterday . __eou__ all right . __eou__ so , what do we do now ? __eou__ this is the lease . you should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . the lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . __eou__ okay . ( reads the lease ) so , according to the lease , i ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and i have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . i understand that i ’ ll get the security deposit back when i move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . __eou__ yes . if you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . __eou__ can i pay you by check ? __eou__ sure . a check will be fine . __eou__ is there a laundry room in the basement ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ can i sign the lease right now ?
yes , ma'am , how could i help you ? __eou__ i am wondering if you do facial care ? __eou__ yes , we do . __eou__ how much would it be ? __eou__ from 200 to 800 . __eou__ i'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . could you recommend something around 300 ? __eou__ no problem .
i'm sorry , but i didn't catch what you said . __eou__ i said , ' do you want me to help you ? ' __eou__ i'm trying to find a post office . __eou__ go three blocks and turn right . it's right there . __eou__ should i take the bus ? __eou__ no . it'll only take about five minutes to walk . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ anytime .
hello , steven . annie said that you and julia have had a quarrel , haven ’ t you ? __eou__ that ’ s true . we had an argument yesterday . she blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner . __eou__ that's the reason why you fought ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ you two are always quarrelling over little things . __eou__ that wasn ’ t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . i'm about to explode ! __eou__ are you still mad at her now ? __eou__ to be honest , i ’ m not , and i regret a little what i have done . __eou__ will you apologize to her ? __eou__ no way . it ’ s her who should apologize .

ok , lucy.it ' s your turn.are you ready ? __eou__ i really would rather just listen.isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ? __eou__ come on ! in the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! __eou__ i know , but ... hey , stanley's here ! i've been wanting to hear him sing all night . __eou__ well , you asked for it . why don't you put on an elvis ' song for him . __eou__ i'll put the song at the front of the list .
who wants to go first ? lily ? __eou__ oh ... i mostly just like to listen . you're the groom . why don't you go first ? __eou__ ok.put on something by the backstreet boys ! __eou__ how about as long as you love me ? you can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee brooke ! __eou__ i'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
i've been learning to play go recently . it's an amazing game ! __eou__ weigh ? it must be a greatest chinese invention . i've tried hard to learn it . its rules can't be any simpler , but i've never won a game of go . well , it's all greek to me ! __eou__ at least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? i think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into chinese culture should learn to play go . __eou__ i heard it is included in the four major arts of china , is it ? __eou__ sure . it was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . i think weigh is the most fantastic of them . it embodies ancient chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__ i know it is quite different from western chess . __eou__ yes . playing chess is a very aggressive experience . all the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . whenever i start a chess game , i can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__ but isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__ certainly not . the object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . in other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive .
may i take a look at the shoes over there ? __eou__ certainly . what's your size ? __eou__ size 24 . are they synthetic or leather ? __eou__ they are all leather . how do they feel ? __eou__ it's comfortable . i will take it .
try it on in front of the mirror . __eou__ well , i think the color is a little too bright . __eou__ we have darker ones . do you like the style ? __eou__ yes . what's this made of and how to wash it ? __eou__ lt's made of silk and you had better wash it by hand in cold water .
is stanley still singing that elvis song ? he's really hogging the mic ! __eou__ if i hear love me tender one more time , i think i'll go crazy ! __eou__ he sounds like a sick cow ! __eou__ can we adjust the pitch a little ? maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . __eou__ i already tried that . nothing seems to help . __eou__ hey ! where are you going ... ? __eou__ coing out for a walk .
let's go to burger queen for lunch . they have good cheese burgers . __eou__ ok . i am hungry , too . i like their milkshake . they're very creamy and tasty . __eou__ look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . it must be very delicious . __eou__ yup . but , this also means we have to wait to order our food . __eou__ come on . it is worth waiting . their cheese burgers are really popular . once you have it , you will love it . __eou__ well , sounds very attractive . i just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious . __eou__ yup , they have good french fries as well . not very thick , but crispy enough . you should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . that is the belgium style . you will love it . __eou__ ok , i think i know what to order for my lunch now . but , eating too much fried food really makes me fat . __eou__ come on . you just have it once in a while , not every day . it will not harm you . __eou__ that's true . you can hear my tummy grumbling . i am really hungry ! __eou__ be patient . good food never comes fast . __eou__ ok !
hi , is you , john ? __eou__ oh , jane . what on earth have you been ? i've called you a thousand times . __eou__ sorry , john . i suddenly got a severe stomachache last night , and stayed in hospital the whole day . __eou__ but i called your cell phone , and there was no answer . __eou__ i know , i left it at home . __eou__ do you feel better now ? __eou__ it's ok now . don't worry , john .
i like chess better than xiangqi . and you ? __eou__ for my part , xiangqi . maybe it's because my girlfriend is chinese . __eou__ i think chess is more reasonable . you see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . a true battle should be like that . soldiers should outnumber the commanders . __eou__ quite right . and unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . it is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . __eou__ correct ! another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . it seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . they are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . __eou__ yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . i think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval europe than in china . __eou__ there's another distinctive contrast . both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . __eou__ you mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? __eou__ sure . on a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . it has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances .
flip it to channel 9 , will you , janet ? there's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes . __eou__ sorry , turkey . i have already got dibs on the tv for tonight , remember ? and i'm watching ' disco fever ' on channel 6 . __eou__ oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? over my dead body . now , don't be such a brat and ... __eou__ hey , what's wrong with the tv ? __eou__ i don't know ! the picture went blank all of a sudden . it's probably the picture tube . __eou__ looks like the tv wins that argument . __eou__ yeah . oh well , how about a game of cards instead ? __eou__ sure , why not ?
do you have cheongsams ? __eou__ yes.we have in stock a variety of styles and they are in different colors.what do you think of this one ? __eou__ the styte is ok . which country is this made in ? __eou__ it's made in china . the quality is excellent . __eou__ please wrap it .
can i help you in any way ? __eou__ i would like to see your summer suits . __eou__ how do you like this pattern ? the pink suits you well . __eou__ will it wash well and the color won't fade ? __eou__ it's of good quality .
do you want to buy a sweater ? __eou__ yes . which one is the latest ? __eou__ the cowl-neck pullovers are new in . it sells like hot cakes . __eou__ it's my style . will it be resistance to balling ? __eou__ of course . the brand is bird and it's famous for its quality .
may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i am looking for a coat . __eou__ do you have any style in your mind ? __eou__ i have no idea . __eou__ i recommend you this one . it's a very popular kind of coat-the most recent thing . __eou__ well , it's good in style , but i am afraid it doesn't wash well .
i think this suit displays your nice finger . __eou__ thank you . could you change it for a purple one ? __eou__ no problem . __eou__ will it shrink when washed ? __eou__ of course not , it is made of pure silk .

could i speak to mr . wu , please ? __eou__ who ’ s calling , please ? __eou__ this is kevin . __eou__ hold on a second , please .
this is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture . __eou__ i had planned to . i can bring some from my place . and there's some more at my parents ' . __eou__ do you have a bed ? __eou__ of course , i have . there is one in my old house . and i have another one from college at my parents ' house . __eou__ that's good . you can put one in this room and put the other one in that room . __eou__ yeah , it is a good idea . you can stay in my house for the night if you would like to . __eou__ yeah . by the way , can i take a shower ? __eou__ sure , but i don't have hot water , yet . __eou__ really ? __eou__ no , they're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . my phone should be working then , too . __eou__ well , do you want to go outside for dinner ? __eou__ yeah , i can't cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . let's go to the restaurant nearby . it's my treat . __eou__ ok . let's go .

slow down ! you can't exceed the speed limits . __eou__ no , i cann't . i'm in a hurry ! __eou__ no , you can not . it is dangerous . __eou__ shut up ! now you are in my car , you should listen to me . or you can get off . i've told you i'm in a hurry . i don't want to waste time on the road . __eou__ no . you shouldn't drive like that .

( having lunch with joseph ) have you ever been invited to a chinese feast ? __eou__ sure . beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . __eou__ as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? __eou__ to begin with , i have to use chopsticks . __eou__ but you look quite proficient in using them now . __eou__ certainly . after all , i've been here for two years . it's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a chinese dinner table . __eou__ yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm in china . hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! you should not stab them vertically into the rice bow ! __eou__ anything strange about that ? __eou__ maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . __eou__ oh , sorry ! there's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .

this is a good basic computer package . it's got a good cpu , 256 megabytes of ram , and a dvd player . __eou__ does it come with a modem ? __eou__ yes , it has a built-in modem . you just plug a phone line into the back of the computer . __eou__ how about the monitor ? __eou__ a 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal . if you want , you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor , for a little more money . __eou__ that's okay . a 15 - inch is good enough . all right , i'll take it .

look ! it is not working well . did you try out the bike when you bought it . __eou__ no , there ’ s no need . we can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged . __eou__ but it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride . __eou__ i know . i will pay attention to such a thing next time .
this is no . 1 bus , bound for sihun . __eou__ excuse me . i will go to wangfujing , where should i get off ? __eou__ there are another six stops . __eou__ we are arriving at tiananmen . please get ready for your arrival . __eou__ is it wangfujing ? __eou__ no , sir . the next stop is wangfujing . __eou__ ok . __eou__ please get ready . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ we are arriving at wangfujing . please get ready . __eou__ is this where i get off ? __eou__ yes .

did you put the blue bin out on the street ? __eou__ oh , no . i forgot . __eou__ well , you'd better take it out front . __eou__ what time does the recycle truck come by ? __eou__ it usually gets here at noon on tuesday , which is tomorrow . __eou__ i'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning . __eou__ oh , no , you don't . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ every morning you get up late and rush off to work late . __eou__ do you think i'll forget to do it ? __eou__ you'll remember to do it , but you won't have time to do it . __eou__ okay , i'll take it out front right now .
excuse me . i'm your new neighbor , jack . i just moved in . __eou__ oh . yes ? __eou__ i'm looking for a grocery store . are there any around here ? __eou__ yes , there are some on pine street . __eou__ ok . and is there a laundromat near here ? __eou__ well , i think there's one across from the shopping center . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ by the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too . __eou__ a barber shop ? !
is this the right bus for san francisco ? __eou__ it sure is.can i see your ticket ? ok , fine . __eou__ when's the first stop ? __eou__ about two hours out of los angeles . give me the bags , i'll put'em on the bus . here's your claim tag . don't lose it.when you get off the bus , give it to me . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ is it all right to smoke on the bus ? __eou__ sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . and alcohol is not allowed . __eou__ i see . thank you .
now i'm sure we'll never get all our things back . they're so clever these criminals . what's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ? __eou__ i only wish it were this time yesterday . __eou__ think how happy we were . now this.things always go wrong . __eou__ perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . we'd feel better . __eou__ i don't feel like breakfast . i don't feel like anything . why are we so unlucky ? it's as if there were a jinx on us . __eou__ perhaps i'd better ring the police ... __eou__ yes . of course . but what good will it do ? that man's miles away from here by now . in our car .
jane ! what an enchanting skirt you have on ! __eou__ thank you ! guess how much it costs . __eou__ bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... darling , it looks elegant on you ! it can't be any cheap stuff . something around two hundred , i guess . __eou__ your offer is way off the mark . it set me back only sixty-five . __eou__ then you got a windfall ! was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__ neither . i drove a hard bargain with the vendor before i got the price down . __eou__ how much did she ask for ? __eou__ three hundred ! that's daylight robbery . how dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? without hesitation , i gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__ she must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__ not at all ! she's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . that's the trade . she only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . she was lying ! then i inquired , ' may i have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__ then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__ yeah . i turned around and started to move out . just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! i may sacrifice a little . let's fix it sixty-five ! can't be cheaper . '
i swear i will never shop at a street market in china . it's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! you have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . __eou__ cool down , harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ? __eou__ yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on open-air fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just now i was told by my chinese colleagues i bought it overpriced . i could have talked my way to thirty . __eou__ is that so ? i'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it's the norm of free trade . the seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . yet you ignored the process . no wonder you ended up easy prey . __eou__ but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? __eou__ of course , that's something really irritating . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . and then you may negotiate for a fair deal .
is your father in the habit of having naps ? __eou__ yes , all of us have naps . __eou__ don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? __eou__ no , not at all .
when do you go to bed usually ? __eou__ i go to bed at ten and get up at six . __eou__ that's helpful for your health . __eou__ sure .
are you ready , pa ? __eou__ in a second . have you got a torch ? __eou__ no . __eou__ here it is . let's go .
let's see if we forget anything . __eou__ oh , we need an umbrella . the weather is so changeable in that area . __eou__ yes , let's go . lock the door , please . __eou__ all right .
do you like the cookies ? __eou__ i finished them in no time . __eou__ glad you like it . __eou__ mum , when will we have them again ?
why is the car before us stopping ? __eou__ what's going on ? __eou__ look . two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . that's why that car stops . __eou__ more and more people easily get irritated while driving . __eou__ yes . this is what is called road rage .
good evening , madam . can i help you ? __eou__ yes . i bought this sheet here yesterday . __eou__ anything wrong with it ? __eou__ yes . when i spread it out back home , i found this hole . __eou__ oh , how awful ! may i have a look at the invoice ? __eou__ here it is . __eou__ well . please accept our sincere apologies , i'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish . __eou__ that's very kind of you . thank you . __eou__ we're sorry that this has happened , and i guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .
would you like a cigarette ? __eou__ no , thanks . i've decided to give up smoking . __eou__ really ? why ? __eou__ well , it's just that i think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . __eou__ i see.you mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? __eou__ that's right . you should give it up , too.it ' s bad for your health . __eou__ stop talking like my mother . that's what she keeps saying . __eou__ but it's true . it's a nasty habit . i can't think why i ever started.anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! __eou__ what do you mean ? what are you talking about ? __eou__ i mean you couldn't give it up !
what's your weight . __eou__ 150 pounds . __eou__ do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . __eou__ i can't bear eating less .
your muscles are a spectacle ! __eou__ thank you.that ' s the result of exercise . __eou__ by the way , do you work out ? __eou__ no , but i am starting working out from now on . __eou__ fine .
are you a wrestler or a boxer ? __eou__ no.why ? __eou__ your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . __eou__ oh , really ? i go to the gym every day .
i can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . __eou__ yes , i find jogging does good to me , so i keep on doing it . __eou__ you've formed a sound habit . __eou__ i think so , too .
excuse me , ma'am ? __eou__ yes . what can i do for you ? __eou__ i'm new here and i can ’ t seem to find the lunch room . __eou__ oh , it ’ s right downstairs . i'm going there myself . just follow me .
you look fresh recently.how do you make it ? __eou__ i attend an aerobic class three times a week . __eou__ aren't you tired ? __eou__ no , i feel young , fresh and energetic .
hello , darling ! did you have a good day today ? __eou__ it was okay . __eou__ would you like a drink ? __eou__ no thanks , i'm not thirsty . __eou__ dinner will be ready at six . are you hungry ? __eou__ not really . __eou__ oh . did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? __eou__ yes i did . __eou__ good . are you going to the pub tonight ? __eou__ yes . i'll be back at the same time as usual .
i'm going to the shops in a minute . what do we need ? __eou__ we're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? __eou__ no problem . we also need bread , so i'll go to the baker's . i'll get some vol au vents for victor's birthday bash on friday . we'll need balloons for that too . __eou__ better visit the supermarket then . we'll need some other things for the party . get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer . __eou__ okay . the library's beside the baker's . i'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . they're overdue . __eou__ i'll see you later then . __eou__ bye ! i'll be back before seven .
the last thing to be ignored at a chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__ does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? the same is true in the west . __eou__ no , absolutely not ! on the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . but always pay attention to what you say . if the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__ you mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? that goes in like with confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__ correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__ any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__ yes , plenty of them . don't eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__ is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__ haha , i'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .
i have no idea what to buy for mary for her birthday . __eou__ me neither ! would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? __eou__ yes , that would be good ! __eou__ we need to think about what she might like . what are her interests ? __eou__ if i remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . __eou__ you know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . who would know her favorite groups ? __eou__ her roommate , malia , might know what her favorite groups are . __eou__ yeah , malia would be able to help us choose a concert . __eou__ let's give malia a call and ask her for her help right now . __eou__ good ! maybe malia would like to go in with us on this gift .
in china at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . __eou__ maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . while they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! __eou__ yes . behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . young people easily become blind worshippers of a westernized life . while they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . __eou__ then what about tea ? we need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the chinese people . __eou__ well . tea represents another facet of popular culture . while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . people visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . __eou__ what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by lao she , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . it is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . __eou__ well , that's true . in a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink .
bob ! your eyes look bloodshot . did you not sleep well ? __eou__ i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table . __eou__ you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in northern china . __eou__ i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another , i'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you to your friends . __eou__ a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood . __eou__ then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ i got you . next time . i'll preface a toast with a statement like ' i can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway .
does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in china ? each time i dropped in at my chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether i want it . __eou__ you've got a point there . it is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . there is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . it might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ so the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . in that case , i guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ it wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . but he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . when the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " thanks " . no matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ so next time , i'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ sure . the guest is welcomed by being served tea . but if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ what does that imply , then ? __eou__ more often than not , the understatement is ' i'm afraid it's time you leave ' .
i need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday . __eou__ we have some fresh red roses . __eou__ how much are the roses ? __eou__ twenty dollars per dozen . __eou__ that sounds like a good deal . __eou__ yes , that is today's sale price . __eou__ i'll take a dozen . __eou__ is there anything else you'd like to get ? __eou__ no , the roses will be fine . __eou__ i'm sure your wife will love them .
overseas operator , may i help you ? __eou__ yes . i would like to place a collect call . __eou__ can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ? __eou__ terry and his number is 4562325 8 . __eou__ please wait a moment . it will take a few seconds to get through .
what reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__ i don't think drinking requires any special purposes . for us people in the west , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__ i know what you mean there . in many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . and that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like matai and showing yellow rice wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . we just be its dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__ and to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.there is too much etiquette to observe . you'ii be set free at a western banquet it seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__ yeah . it's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__ yes . for me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . if only i had thechance to enjoy chinese matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a western banquet !
it's raining heavily . __eou__ we have to find a shelter . __eou__ all right . __eou__ let's go under the tree . __eou__ no , we can't . it's thundering . __eou__ then let's go to that store .
oh , sam ! is this your dog ? __eou__ it's cindy , you know that . hey , cindy , say hello to maria . __eou__ cindy , you're so cute . __eou__ she is also very naughty . by the way , do you have a dog , maria ? __eou__ i have a little white cat . __eou__ oh , a cat ? come on . __eou__ yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . __eou__ but i think they're dull , aren't they ? __eou__ not at all . they're quiet most of the time.but they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . __eou__ well , cats are certainly more independent . __eou__ absolutely . believe it or not , i found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . __eou__ oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? __eou__ yes . it was starving and looking for something to eat when i saw it . __eou__ poor cat . __eou__ now we get along very well . it makes me feel that i'm someone special .
traffic rules are different among countries . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ people drive on the right in china . __eou__ oh , that's interesting !
how can we avoid the jam ? __eou__ let's take a roundabout way . __eou__ ok . __eou__ look , traffic jam again !
usually cities have greater traffic problems . __eou__ of course , there're too many people . __eou__ i hate the car columns on the road . __eou__ but we couldn't help it .
how do you get road news ? __eou__ i've a driver mate in my car ! __eou__ so you have all the news on broadcast ? __eou__ yes , it's so helpful .
i can't find proper parking space . __eou__ let's just park here . __eou__ no , there's no parking sign . __eou__ oh , the policeman's coming .
john , it ’ s time to get up . __eou__ it can ’ t be time to get up yet . __eou__ it is . hurry up ! you ’ ll be late for school . __eou__ what ’ s the time ? __eou__ it ’ s nearly half past seven . __eou__ my watch says ten past . __eou__ it ’ s slow . hurry up ! the bus goes at twenty to eight . __eou__ are you sure half past seven ? __eou__ positive . i ’ ll put the radio on . __eou__ ( and here is the seven o ’ clock news ) it ’ s only seven o ’ clock . your watch is fast . __eou__ no , it isn ’ t . it ’ s stopped . i forgot to wind it up last night . __eou__ i could have stayed in bed for another half hour .
this is the rush hour . __eou__ i notice there's a jam a few blocks away . __eou__ let's drive off this road . __eou__ i'm afraid i'll be late .
how often does the bus run ? __eou__ every five minutes . __eou__ oh , here comes a bus ! __eou__ it comes on the dot .
why do you stop me ? __eou__ you have gone against the traffic rules . __eou__ i'm sorry . __eou__ do you know this is a onaway street ? __eou__ i don't know . __eou__ you have to pay a fine .
shit , so crowded ! __eou__ the radio said it's ok on this road . __eou__ things change every minute . __eou__ we have too many cars !
how long do i have to wait ? __eou__ two hours.that area is a little backward . __eou__ i see.the bus doesn't come so often as in cities . __eou__ you're right .
hi , sam . i want to buy a pet . do you have any ideas ? __eou__ you really should go to rachel's pet store . __eou__ why ? anything special there ? __eou__ it's more than special . you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . __eou__ oh , really ? are there any snakes ? __eou__ snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . __eou__ that's terrific . i can't wait to check it out . __eou__ hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? __eou__ why not ? it's so cool . __eou__ but it will pose a risk to your health . __eou__ pardon ? __eou__ i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems . __eou__ well , i didn't realize that . __eou__ i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . __eou__ oh , i should have thought of my brother's baby girl . maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . __eou__ yes , good luck , maria .
excuse me . would you tell me where the people's park is ? __eou__ the people's park is located on nanjing road , near limbo road , just on the opposite side of the international hotel . __eou__ how long will it take me to get there ? __eou__ only about twenty minutes . __eou__ i'm not going in the wrong direction , am i ? __eou__ no , you aren't . just go ahead , please . __eou__ may i take a bus to get there ? __eou__ you can take the no . 22 trolley bus to get there . __eou__ ok . thank you a lot .
what a terrible house ! __eou__ i'm sick of it , too . __eou__ the door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking __eou__ there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__ it's no use complaining.if we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it !
do you like shopping ? __eou__ yeah . i go shopping once a week __eou__ why don't you do your shopping at home ? __eou__ what do you mean ? i can't understand . __eou__ i mean you can buy things through the internet , that is e-commerce . __eou__ really ? that's unbelievable .
oh , here comes a bus ! __eou__ it's here at last ! __eou__ how long have you waited ? __eou__ twenty minutes exactly .
i'll be late because i have waited so long ! __eou__ don't worry.the bus will arrive soon . __eou__ i'd better take a taxi . __eou__ that's no use.this is morning rush hour .
oh , the bus is gone . __eou__ pity we didn't catch it . __eou__ i'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus . __eou__ we have to wait six more minutes !
come on in.let me show you the house.isn ' t it something ? __eou__ spacious , bright and clean.and the walls were newly painted . __eou__ have you ever seen such a nice house ? __eou__ not really . __eou__ this is the kitchen.every - thing's new . __eou__ it's great !
i've found a nice place in this district.three bedrooms , a large kitchen . __eou__ high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . __eou__ it sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . __eou__ what about the one on the yellow river road ? __eou__ it's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . __eou__ it's a bit small but looks nice . __eou__ what's more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company .
hello , may i help you ? __eou__ yes.we ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent . __eou__ oh , how nice.they ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet . __eou__ a nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for . __eou__ well , gentleman.each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's ok . __eou__ that sounds just wonderful to us . __eou__ when do you want to move in ? __eou__ how about this afternoon ? __eou__ fine . i'll be expecting you around two .
my dear , it's five flights up ! __eou__ that's all right.we ' ll get used to it.besides , it is quiet up there . __eou__ we're little further away from the street and traffic noise __eou__ and there's no one living over us . __eou__ is the place well-furnished ? __eou__ yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . __eou__ what about the kitchen ? __eou__ the stove and refrigerator are in good working order , __eou__ and i don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . __eou__ are the plumbing all right ? __eou__ the plumbing seems ok , too . __eou__ the toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water __eou__ and the sinks don't seem to leak . __eou__ the place is ok . let's go there and have a look at it again .
hey , robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . where did you get it ? __eou__ thanks , i like it too . i bought it at the nearby department store . __eou__ that's nice . do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? __eou__ yeah , i know that . but at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . __eou__ true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to china for the first time . __eou__ yeah , but personally i hate bargaining . if i bargain , i might come to a lower price . but i will never know the true price of what i am buying , and i'll always have the feeling that i am over charged at those places . __eou__ yeah , i have the same feeling . also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . but at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not . __eou__ that's why i like department stores more . shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things i am unable to grow accustomed to . __eou__ i understand . while it's always good to follow the local customs , i guess there are exceptions .
i'm afraid i forgot to lock the door . __eou__ you're so careless , billy . __eou__ sorry , mum , i'll lock it right away . __eou__ i've done it for you .
my mp3 player is broken , so i want to change it for an mp4 player . can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? __eou__ an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? you can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . mp4 ? __eou__ oh , that's a good idea . perhaps i should have a try . __eou__ look at my cell phone . i can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . it's just like a pad . __eou__ that's cool . i can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but i'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__ that's ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__ yeah , if i buy a cell phone like this , i don't have to take a music player everywhere i go , and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . __eou__ that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? __eou__ 256mb . __eou__ then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512mb .
can i help you ? __eou__ yes , i'm in a bit of a rush . could i have a piece of apple pie please ? __eou__ certainly . would you like it with ice cream ? __eou__ no , thanks .
george , did you remember to buy me the book ? __eou__ sorry , darling , i forgot . __eou__ when will you buy it then ? __eou__ i promise you'll have it tomorrow .
our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . __eou__ it is true . i think we should change some policies . __eou__ right . like our lpf program . the mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their lpf accounts . __eou__ indeed , it's unfair . households with higher salaries receive larger lpf contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . __eou__ like you and me !
willy , i don't think we have much butter . can you buy some ? __eou__ sure , mum.in a minute . __eou__ here's the money.and get some salt . __eou__ yes , mum .
i can't believe that . __eou__ what ? __eou__ i've never heard mary cursed anybody . but i heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . __eou__ oh . why did she do that ? __eou__ the car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our car .
henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__ no , i'm not clear . __eou__ we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__ don't make a fuss.the price is rising
do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? __eou__ i think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest change ? __eou__ well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . __eou__ that's true . you know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . __eou__ would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? __eou__ i guess i'm a bit old-fashioned . i'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . __eou__ that's very respectable , but i could never live with my parents . i usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! __eou__ how about your other siblings ? do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? __eou__ two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . they enjoy spending their free time with my parents . i guess in that respect , i'm the black sheep of the family . __eou__ i see . do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? __eou__ they're always asking me to come home , but i think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . whenever we see each other , all we do is fight .
good afternoon , madam . how can i help you ? __eou__ well , i am a little bit out of shape . i think i should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? __eou__ first of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs . __eou__ how can you get that done ? __eou__ well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . the trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan . __eou__ what else ? __eou__ since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal . __eou__ sounds pretty good . how much do you charge ? __eou__ that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . __eou__ perhaps one month . i'll just have a try at first . __eou__ wise decision . that is 400 yuan . you'll find it's totally worth it . __eou__ ok , i'll take it .
hey , you look great ! how's everything ? __eou__ yeah , you know what ? i've been going to the club regularly . the training really pays off . now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit . __eou__ really ? tell me about it . i haven't gone to the club for a long time . i am too busy with work . __eou__ it's important to do proper exercises . __eou__ you're right . too much or too little won't do any good . __eou__ the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet . __eou__ sounds reasonable . __eou__ we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . __eou__ and fruits ! __eou__ surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . __eou__ i've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? __eou__ yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can also help one to keep sound physical health . __eou__ i think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . __eou__ you bet it !
hey , jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the tv all day . anything interesting on tv ? __eou__ not really . quite boring right now , actually . mostly infomercials and public service announcements . __eou__ why don't you turn off the tv and get outside ? you need to get some fresh air . __eou__ i know , i know.but my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . it's the series finals , and i wouldn't miss it for the world ! __eou__ really ? what's the series about ? __eou__ well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america . it's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . i think you'd like it . __eou__ it sounds interesting , but i am not a big fan of tv shows . they're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__ i believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . take this show for example , it examines american xenophobia and how it might conflict with the american dream , with hilarious results . __eou__ really ? that's interesting ! __eou__ yeah.oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . it should be good . __eou__ ok , i'll give it a go .
have you ever tried shopping online ? __eou__ no , never . i prefer to actually see and touch what i'm buying before i pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . __eou__ that's right . seeing is believing . __eou__ i've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . __eou__ that happens . without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . __eou__ what's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . __eou__ it's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . paying online is much safer than before , but i still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . __eou__ i can't agree more . that's why i only do street shopping . __eou__ me too . sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . __eou__ that's a good idea .
did you watch the finale last night ? my favorite singer won ! __eou__ oh , i love him too . he not only sings well but shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__ yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . he then tried at another two auditions . __eou__ he had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . and that's when i started to notice him . __eou__ me too . __eou__ before he made the top three , i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out . __eou__ yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ? __eou__ absolutely . that's why when he entered the finale , i was so excited . __eou__ he really did a great job in the finale , especially in the pk round . he performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . __eou__ and the host announced that he won it all !
have you watched any of the talent shows on tv ? __eou__ yes , i've watched the finale for the ' super girl ' . the producer is very smart to copy the program from the us , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . __eou__ yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . __eou__ that ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . __eou__ but it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . there's no such program on this year . __eou__ yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . __eou__ no surprise . the over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . __eou__ and they lack originality . talent shows like ' super girl ' and ' super boy ' are largely clones of ' the american idol ' . __eou__ the same is true for ' my hero ' . winners of the contest used to star in the tv series ' the frog prince ' . __eou__ i think producers are underestimating the audience . they should think of better ways to entertain the general public .
your mp3 looks so cool . where did you get it ? __eou__ i bought it online . __eou__ really ? do you often shop online ? __eou__ yes . i buy most of my daily necessities online . __eou__ i've never tried e-shopping . is it better than shopping at an actual store ? __eou__ yes , much better . you can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . __eou__ wounds good , and i don't have to queue up at the cashier . __eou__ and you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall . __eou__ well , are there any other advantages ? __eou__ yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . __eou__ are there many choices of online shopping ? __eou__ sure . you can buy almost anything you can think of . __eou__ perhaps i should have a try .
hello . do you know how i can find a room to rent ? __eou__ there is so much information and i advise to read newspaper . __eou__ will that work ? __eou__ yes , of course . if you like the room , call the landlord and confirm the information of the room . __eou__ good idea . thank you .
do you like the room ? __eou__ yes . what is the rent ? __eou__ $ 300 per month . __eou__ then what's the rent due date ? __eou__ at the beginning of the month . besides , you should pay me $ 1000 as deposit .
do you have any apartment to rent ? __eou__ yes . right now i have a studio . __eou__ where is it . __eou__ in the downtown , near the square . __eou__ is it furnished ? __eou__ yes , and the rent includes utilities . __eou__ that's good . when can i go to see the house ? __eou__ what about next saturday . __eou__ fine .
excuse me , where am i on this map ? __eou__ you're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city . __eou__ which bus should i take to railway station ? __eou__ you can take a no . 2 bus here . __eou__ where am i supposed to change ? __eou__ at longing street .
julia , what time is it ? __eou__ eight o'clock . it's time for you to get up and have breakfast . __eou__ oh , my god ! i'm going to be late ! i have no time to have breakfast now . ( hurry on his clothes . ) __eou__ you won't go to work today , steven , it's sunday . come and have breakfast now . __eou__ oh , i have a poor memory now . i haven't had enough sleep lately . i had a bad dream just now . __eou__ you have been too tired recently , darling . that's why i didn't wake you up this morning . after breakfast , you can go to sleep again . __eou__ yes . i really need to have a good rest .
steven , it's ten o'clock . i'm going to bed . i'm beat . __eou__ okay . i'm going to stay up a while . i've got to go over the household budget . we've sightly overspent this month . __eou__ oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? it's already past 10 . __eou__ but i'm not sleepy , darling . i want to finish it today . __eou__ okay . please close the door to the basement before you go to bed . i don't want the dog down there tonight . __eou__ okay . good night . have a good dream . __eou__ good night .
you must be mr.sellers . i'm steven . i am here to see the apartment you advertised . __eou__ oh , nice to see you . the apartment is on the tenth floor . the previous tenant just moved out yesterday . __eou__ could i have a look at it first ? __eou__ sure . let me show you the way . here we are . apartment 1008 . ( they enter . ) this is the living room dining room combination . here's the kitchen . it's small , but fully equipped . the refrigerator is new , and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old . __eou__ it's nice . so this is the bathroom . and that must be the bedroom . __eou__ yes . and there's a walk-in closet . __eou__ is there air conditioning ? __eou__ yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . the thermostat is in the living room 。 __eou__ what's the house rent ? when is the rent due ? and how much security deposit do you require ? __eou__ it's 600 yuan per month.the rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . we ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . it will be returned to you at the end of your lease . __eou__ i like the apartment , mr.sellers . you can show me the lease .
what's the name of this street ? __eou__ university street . __eou__ do you know of any banks near here ? __eou__ you'll see one at the corner on your right .
can you hold the end of this tape measure ? __eou__ sure . what's this for ? __eou__ i ' m taking some measurements for new curtains . __eou__ what about measuring the floor for a new carpet , and the walls for new wallpaper ? __eou__ i thought we'll just fix up the wood floor.and use some paint for the walls . __eou__ good idea . i was thinking the same myself . __eou__ tomorrow we'll go and pick out some curtains and paint .
julia , the apartment i looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters . __eou__ great . where is it ? __eou__ a new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the sanlitun area . __eou__ what about the surrounding area ? __eou__ very quiet and safe . and it's got a lot of trees and plants . __eou__ that's good . is the location easily accessible ? __eou__ yeah , it's near a bus stop . __eou__ hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then .
have you ever thought about your ideal home ? __eou__ i have , actually ; i ’ ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . __eou__ what would it be like ? __eou__ well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . __eou__ how many rooms would it have ? __eou__ i ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . i ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other . __eou__ how many bathrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__ i ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__ how would you decorate your house ? __eou__ i don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so i wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . i would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets . __eou__ how many tvs would your dream home have ? __eou__ i think tv is a great waste of time , so i would only have one small tv in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning .
we need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on . __eou__ why ? __eou__ well , i think we should save more . if we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better . __eou__ really , well , ok . get the receipts out . __eou__ let's see . we spent $ 700 for our home loan payment , $ 300 0n groceries , $ 75 0n utilities , $ 250 n gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 400 0n entertainment last month . __eou__ that's $ 1 825 . __eou__ we put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . __eou__ $ 3 075 . our paychecks is $ 3 300 , combined . that means we don't have any receipts for $ 225 . __eou__ right . stop thinking about it . where do you think we can save more money ? __eou__ well , we could eat in more often . that $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . __eou__ yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook . __eou__ all right .
excuse me , can you tell me where central park street is ? __eou__ turn right at the third light and then go straight for two blocks . __eou__ is it far ? __eou__ no . it's only a ten-minute walk . __eou__ i see . thanks a lot . __eou__ you're welcome .
excuse me , how do i get to the forbidden city ? __eou__ follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . it'll be right there . __eou__ is it far ? __eou__ no , it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot . __eou__ thank you .
excuse me . could you please tell me how to get to the nearest cinema ? __eou__ turn left at the second light . you can't miss it . __eou__ will it take me long to get there ? __eou__ no . it's not far at all . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ that's all right . have a good day .
it ’ s so great to be here ! i ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! __eou__ we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . would you like a tour of the house ? __eou__ that ’ d be great , but could i have a cup of tea first ? __eou__ sure , i ’ ll just go put the kettle on . why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and i ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . __eou__ that would be lovely , thanks . __eou__ do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? __eou__ i ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup . __eou__ ok . what do you think about our living room ? __eou__ well , i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but i don ’ t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient . __eou__ my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . __eou__ oh dear . well , i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here . __eou__ your daughter usually does the dusting , and i do the vacuuming . __eou__ i see . well , i can help with the chores while i ’ m here . you two could probably use my help . __eou__ that ’ s very nice of you to offer . here ’ s your tea . be careful , it ’ s still quite hot .
excuse me , ma'am . can you tell me where the nearest postoffice is ? __eou__ of course . go straight ahead . turn right at the next street . you'll see a tall , yellow building.the post office is on the first floor . __eou__ do you mean that i go that way for one block , then turn right ? __eou__ yes , you are right . __eou__ is it far ? __eou__ no , it's only about five minutes ' walk . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ it's my pleasure .
would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ sorry , i'm not really that interested in those things . __eou__ they are very nice , you know . __eou__ really ? __eou__ and not expensive either . __eou__ oh . i don't care about that . __eou__ everybody's buying them . __eou__ are they ? __eou__ yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ i'm afraid i'm not interested in fashion . there are so many other really important things in the world .
excuse me , is there a hotel nearby ? __eou__ the nearest one is about ten minutes ' walk from here . __eou__ how can i get there ? __eou__ just walk down this road and you'll find it . it's on the right side .
can you tell me the way to library ? __eou__ sure , turn left at the next crossing . __eou__ is it on xinhua street ? __eou__ yes . you can't miss it .
alright , tell me what you think . __eou__ don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? __eou__ yeah , maybe you ’ re right . how about this outfit ? __eou__ this dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? __eou__ no , i don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . __eou__ i like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . it ’ s too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this scarf , these earrings , amd an anklet ? __eou__ that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ? __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__ thanks . you ’ d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ? __eou__ yep . here it is . what do you think ? __eou__ that looks great . just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__ the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ? __eou__ no , they ’ re a prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . __eou__ that ’ s even better than the real thing . __eou__ if i were you , i ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . if you spend $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . __eou__ it ’ s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
hello , i ’ d like to speak to kate . __eou__ i ’ m sorry she is not in at the moment . can i take a message ? __eou__ it ’ s ok . i ’ ll call her back latter . thank you . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
how much is this shirt , please ? __eou__ it's 89 yuan . __eou__ do you have it in a larger size ? __eou__ let me check .
your daughter will be back soon . i'm going to start making dinner . you can just watch some tv in tv room if you like . we just bought a new tv with a lcd screen . the remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair . __eou__ would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking . __eou__ this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . __eou__ cooking makes me feel relaxed . so , what are we cooking ? __eou__ ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . here's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? __eou__ sure . we should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . __eou__ that's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ? __eou__ that's a bit high for lasagne . i'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . __eou__ fine . i'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . __eou__ you know , i could do this myself . why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? __eou__ i don't think it's broken . __eou__ well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! __eou__ fine . i'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
excuse me , do you go to the central park ? __eou__ yes , this is the right bus . __eou__ could you please tell me when i get to the central park ? __eou__ don't worry . i'll call out the stops . __eou__ ( a few minutes later . ) should i get off at the next stop ? __eou__ no , don't worry . i'll get you off when you get there . __eou__ is it a long ride ? __eou__ no , not that long . two more stops , and you'll get off , sir . __eou__ ok . i know . thank you . __eou__ not at all .
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ of course . is the dinner still on ? __eou__ yes , i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ that's what i thought you would do . listen , i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it's just down the street from all the bars . you probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ it can't be that bad . __eou__ i wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings , because i've never noticed anything strange when i've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ do me a favor , and take a taxi . it'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ ok , we will . how do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ when i first moved in , i walked everywhere . but within a week , i had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! now , i always take public transportation . __eou__ has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ nothing else has happened to me , but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ well , we'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
excuse me , i ’ ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.do you know why the traffic is so heavy ? __eou__ a lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up . __eou__ oh , what a terrible situation ! this traffic is unbearable . __eou__ yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . if we had gone early we would miss the traffic . __eou__ i agree with you . but now we have to wait . the sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . i fear a thunder storm is brewing . __eou__ don ’ t worry . the traffic jam is said to be over soon . __eou__ yes , i hope so . thank you for telling me this . __eou__ it ’ s my pleasure .
julia , julia , julia . my daring julia , what's wrong with you ? __eou__ steven , are you talking to me ? __eou__ yes , i have called you three times . what makes you in a daze ? __eou__ i was thinking about the accident i saw in the morning . i was petrified when two cars collided . i witnessed the traffic accident . __eou__ did someone get hurt ? __eou__ a driver died instantly . the other one was badly hurt . a poor boy called peter was killed in the accident too . __eou__ what a terrible accident ! who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? __eou__ i think both . they drove too fast . what's worse , one of them was drunk . __eou__ why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? __eou__ i don ’ t understand . maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool .
hello ! is your taxi engaged ? __eou__ no , this taxi is free . __eou__ please take me to the honging hotel . __eou__ ok . please get in . i'm glad to serve you . __eou__ could you get there in twenty minutes ? __eou__ it will take half an hour to get to the hotel . __eou__ i am in a hurry . please take a shortcut . i have a friend waiting for me . __eou__ ok , i promise we'll get there in twenty minutes . __eou__ thanks .
it's such a nice day outside . let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ i know . but we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ what kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ i'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__ i promise . we're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__ ok , let's go then ! __eou__ do you have any money ? __eou__ for what ? __eou__ for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . __eou__ you said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__ i agreed to not go into the mall , but i can still look at things in the market ! __eou__ i should have known ...
what time does the museum close ? any idea ? __eou__ i'm not sure , but i think it's open until 4 o'clock . __eou__ what time is it now ? __eou__ it's a quarter past three .
what do you think about this store ? i heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities . __eou__ i love this store . the only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . __eou__ don ’ t worry . i ’ ve decided that for your birthday i ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . __eou__ really ? i thought you hated shopping ? __eou__ i do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! __eou__ sure . that ’ s really nice of you . let ’ s go in and try some things on . __eou__ how about this red dress ? i think it would really suit you . __eou__ that ’ s gorgeous ! do they have it in a size 8 ? __eou__ here you go.on any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . __eou__ i think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . do they have the same dress in white ? __eou__ let me look . let ’ s see ... they ’ ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . here you are . __eou__ this is perfect ! what do you think ? __eou__ i think you look fantastic . happy birthday ! __eou__ i ’ m so lucky . you only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! thanks honey !
steven , you are always looking in good shape . how do you keep it ? __eou__ i pay much attention to my daily diet . you know good eating habits help to fortify the body against disease . __eou__ yeah , you are right . tell me your normal diet . __eou__ i eat more fruits and vegetables and limit amounts of fatty and fried foods . __eou__ and ? __eou__ i drink milk every day . it's really good for building strong bones and teeth . i drink tea quite often , for it's protective against kidney cancer . __eou__ oh , no wonder you are healthy . __eou__ you are what you eat , and a healthy diet creates a body resistant to disease . __eou__ thanks for sharing your experience with me . __eou__ you're welcome !
how is your house hunting going ? __eou__ not very well . i haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . __eou__ how much are you looking to spend ? __eou__ i can only afford about 300 pounds a month . __eou__ looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . __eou__ really ? that ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__ well , if you want to live in london , you have to pay the price ! __eou__ do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? __eou__ i can ask around at work . do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? __eou__ i ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but i guess i ’ ll have to take what i can get ! __eou__ how long do you want to sign a contract for ? __eou__ i can sign a contract up to a year . i don ’ t know where i ’ ll be after that . __eou__ do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? __eou__ i don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . __eou__ you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? __eou__ no , i thought that would be included in the rent . __eou__ it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . __eou__ i don't think i can afford that . __eou__ don ’ t worry . sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . i ’ ll look into finding something like that .
julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing . __eou__ why do you say that ? __eou__ i heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . the robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight . __eou__ thank god , we haven't encountered a burglar . i hope that our house is secure against burglary . __eou__ i am worrying about it too . i want to install a security door . __eou__ is the security door useful ? __eou__ yes , i think so . the security door is so firm that nobody can break in . __eou__ i totally agree with you . in this way i won't be afraid of the burglar if you are away . __eou__ ok , i will do it right now .
mr.sellers ? it's steven speaking , your tenant . we've just suffered a power failure.what should i do now ? __eou__ all right , steven . do you have a flashlight ? __eou__ yes , i do . __eou__ ok , now go down to the basement and find the circuit box . open it and check if there are any fuses blown out . __eou__ how do i know if it's blown out ? __eou__ you'll see it's black and has burnt smell . __eou__ then what shall i do ? __eou__ unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones . you can find them on the rack in the basement . __eou__ ok , i'll try . i'll call you again if that doesn't work .
how do i get to the post office from school ? __eou__ turn right outside the school ; go along until you come to the main road ; turn left ; go straight ahead , straight on at the roundabout , down the hill , and turn left at the bottom . __eou__ ok , i see . thank you very much . __eou__ you are welcome . hope you can find it soon .
what's your apartment like ? __eou__ it's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__ what is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__ it's not as bad as i thought it would be . the freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . but , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__ did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__ no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__ do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__ no , it's all included . besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__ how long is your contract for ? __eou__ that's the bad thing---the contract ends in june , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__ have you started looking yet ? __eou__ not yet . i'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__ good luck !
have you moved into your new house yet , michael ? __eou__ we just moved in yesterday , actually . __eou__ so , what do you think about the place ? are you glad that you moved in ? __eou__ it's great ! unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up . __eou__ how old is the house then ? __eou__ it's about 200 years old . it has a lot of history ! __eou__ sounds fascinating . where is your new house located ? __eou__ it's just off of the ring road . __eou__ do you have a big yard ? __eou__ it's bigger than our last one . i've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back . __eou__ is your house well-lit ? __eou__ oh , yes . our windows let plenty of natural light in . they've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house . __eou__ how many rooms does your house have ? __eou__ right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . we're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . in fact , when the guest bedroom is ready , you should come and stay with us for a weekend . __eou__ i'd be up for that !
steven , what's the expense of moving house ? __eou__ about 3 000 dollars . __eou__ it costs a lot of money . hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ? __eou__ i am afraid not , darling . our expenses are mounting . __eou__ we have to cut back on our shopping from now on . __eou__ don't worry . maybe i can find a part-time job to increase my income . __eou__ i hope so .
oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! no wonder there are few people . __eou__ beauty costs , dear ! what do you think of this dress ? do you think it suits me ? __eou__ yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . you don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? __eou__ come on , you sound like my mom.look at it , it's beautiful ! __eou__ when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . __eou__ maybe you have a point . __eou__ make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . __eou__ all right . how about this black skirt ? it can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! __eou__ that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . __eou__ oh ! hey , look , that's the same shirt britney wore in her concert . __eou__ exactly ! oh , my god ! i love britney ! i'm going to get it . __eou__ why not try it on ? __eou__ it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! i'll take it . oh , no , i'm a little short . did you bring your credit card ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ i promise i'll pay you back as soon as we get home .
how far is it from here to the airport ? __eou__ it ’ s about an hour ’ s drive . __eou__ i need to get there before ten.can we make it ? __eou__ i can ’ t promise , but i ’ ll do my best .

hey ayden , i was wondering if you could do me a favor . __eou__ that depends . what is it ? __eou__ it's kind of a big favor . i'm absolutely flat broke , and i owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until friday to give it to her , but i don't get paid until next monday . do you think you could loan me some cash until i get paid ? __eou__ i'd love to help you out , but i'm a bit short on cash this month as well . i had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . __eou__ if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . i'll pay you back on monday . i promise . __eou__ let's see , i've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . i can only spare about $ 20 . i would give you more if i had it , i just don't have much money to my name right now . __eou__ thanks a lot ayden . every little bit will help . tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__ that'd be great . thanks ! what time should i come over ? __eou__ how about at 6 pm ? __eou__ see you then !

steven , shall we go shopping tomorrow ? __eou__ hum ... why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? tomorrow is saturday . i hate all the hustle and bustle of saturday shopping . __eou__ but sunday is the same with saturday . if you don ’ t mind , that's ok . __eou__ hum.maybe it will be better . the most important thing is that i can have a day to relax after a week's work . __eou__ i see . we will go the day after tomorrow . __eou__ by the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ? __eou__ i want to buy some clothes in clothing store . when we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken . __eou__ let ’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . i want to buy one for you as your birthday present . __eou__ thank you , darling .
we really were lucky . we got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! did you see the long lines behind us ? __eou__ yeah , i'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . i'm starving ! __eou__ let's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? __eou__ what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? __eou__ i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . __eou__ well , let's get a plate of those then . __eou__ sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ? __eou__ i think i might have a dahl . __eou__ what's in a dahl ? __eou__ it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . __eou__ that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ? __eou__ ok . how about some lamb kebabs ? __eou__ that's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ? __eou__ i think i'll have a beer . __eou__ ok , shall i flag down the waitress ? __eou__ i wouldn't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round . __eou__ you're right . that might seem a bit rude . it's a good thing i've got you with me ! __eou__ what would you do without me ?
excuse me , could you tell me which line i ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? __eou__ you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your package . __eou__ that ’ s a really long line . how long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? __eou__ it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait . __eou__ can i buy stamps here ? __eou__ sure . how many would you like ? __eou__ i need 30 for my christmas cards . __eou__ are you sending them abroad ? __eou__ twenty of them are going abroad to china and america . __eou__ do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do , those are less expensive . __eou__ no . __eou__ ok , here you go . that will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence . __eou__ and the bubble wrap ? __eou__ that ’ s another quid . __eou__ thanks a lot . you ’ ve been very helpful .

catherine , have you ever seen the movie fast food nation ? __eou__ yes , i remember it was inspired by a new york times best-seller of the same name . __eou__ it's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? __eou__ exactly . it reveals the dark side of the all-american meal . __eou__ so what do you think of the american fast food culture ? __eou__ i think america really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find mcdonald ' s , kfc and pizza hut almost all over the states . __eou__ and everyone knows that americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? __eou__ sure . you see , tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . people just don't care whether it is healthy or not . __eou__ but i think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. __eou__ what are they ? __eou__ such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . __eou__ they're much better __eou__ but i'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . __eou__ that's the point . people usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . __eou__ well , americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . __eou__ i suppose so .

you see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth the wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . they do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . __eou__ entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . __eou__ a young french fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , when i fastened the cord and walked to the platform , i was extremely nervous . when i looked down , i was nervous even more.if the cord had broken , i would be knocked to bake meat . however , i knew my worries were unwanted . i was afraid if i retreated others might say something about me . i had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . i only felt wind wiring at my ears . my body rapidly descended . i thought that after only seven or eight seconds i was rebounded to upper air by the cord . in fact it was 30 seconds . maybe because of my nervousness , i only felt seven or eight seconds . when rebounding to the high altitude , i felt a sudden sense of relief . i did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . __eou__ it is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable !

excuse me . do you think i can get there in time to catch the 11:30 train ? __eou__ well , let me see . now it's 11:00 sharp . it's a long way to go.if i take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.if i take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more . which do you prefer ? __eou__ are you sure that i can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ? __eou__ generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens . __eou__ how much more do i have to pay ? __eou__ compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 euro more . __eou__ that's acceptable . no one wants to miss a train . __eou__ ok ... here we are . we'll turn left at this cross . to go straight ahead is the shortest route . __eou__ thank you !
gosh , another stop.it seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , it's no quicker than a bus . __eou__ that's true . during rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses . __eou__ it was silly of me to have taken a taxi . __eou__ at least , it can free you from the crowd . by the way , do you come from china ? __eou__ no , from new zealand , sir . i visited new zealand and saw lots of overseas people there . __eou__ wow , like america . it receives a great number of visitors every year . __eou__ the more the world becomes open , the more people become international !
do you want a taxi ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ where to ? __eou__ do you know where dawanglu is ? __eou__ yes , i know it . __eou__ you can take me there ? __eou__ yes , of course . step in , please ! __eou__ that's good . __eou__ buckle up the belt , please . __eou__ let's go .
how can i lose weight , doctor ? i seem to get fatter even when i just look at food ? __eou__ well , jim . it is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . __eou__ i never eat breakfast though . __eou__ that's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food . __eou__ i never thought about it that way . __eou__ i bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ oh doctor , i feel so foolish . __eou__ way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ i know doctor , thank you so much .
where to , ma'am ? __eou__ the grand hotel . __eou__ the grand hotel ? __eou__ yes . do you know where it is ? __eou__ no , madam . i don't think i do . __eou__ it's the 11th avenue , park street . __eou__ oh , yes . i know where it is .
hey , ann , i am really sorry about last night . i shouldn't have said those things to you . __eou__ i am sorry too . i know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend . __eou__ don't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime . __eou__ thanks for understanding . __eou__ well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? __eou__ hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides , you and bob haven't seen each other for a while . i don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . __eou__ nah , i wouldn't worry about that . but i don't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves . __eou__ i know bob won't mind . you can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . __eou__ maybe ... i'll think about it . __eou__ well , i think you should come and have some fun . besides you never know maybe he likes you as well . you should at least try .
going to the gym tonight , mary ? __eou__ yes , sally . i want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ that sounds like fun.would you mind some company ? __eou__ i'd love it.working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ i'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ good.if you happen to see jim and bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .
it's getting late , mary . __eou__ maybe i should go home . __eou__ why don't you sleep over ? __eou__ are you sure ? __eou__ we can sleep together . __eou__ sounds like a good idea . __eou__ don't forget to call your host mother to tell her . __eou__ thanks for reminding me .
hello , may i help you ? __eou__ yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . __eou__ oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . __eou__ that is exactly what we're looking for . __eou__ well , each room is 40 dollars a week . __eou__ that sounds all right to us . __eou__ when do you want to move in ? __eou__ how about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ fine , i'll be expecting you . __eou__ see you tomorrow .
hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__ haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ every night my roommates watch the korean soap operas till mid-night . i am not a big fan of korean shows and i don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__ well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__ yeah , i know , but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they won't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon . __eou__ i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand , when i wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . for me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . though i don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . __eou__ yeah , i crave my own space . i just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . we all need our private space . but i also think interpersonal skills very important . living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time .
what is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ? __eou__ ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair . __eou__ yes . __eou__ hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . tipping one's chair is unforgivable .
how many rooms are you looking for ? __eou__ oh , four or five . how much is the rent for this apartment ? __eou__ 150 a month . __eou__ 150 ? no , i'm not really interested in this place . it isn't big enough . it isn't near enough to my office . 150 ? __eou__ rents are very high in downtown area .
bob , did you see our supervisor ? i need him to sign this paper . __eou__ he is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . __eou__ what's up ? __eou__ nothing . but he is in a bad mood today . __eou__ thanks for the warning . __eou__ that's all right .
i want to leave home , mum . __eou__ why ? __eou__ i am a grown-up , and i can stand on my own two feet . __eou__ it is all up to you .
hello . this is the customer service . how can i help you ? __eou__ yes . i ’ ve been getting harassing calls recently . can i have my phone number changed ? __eou__ sure . what ’ s your favorite number ? __eou__ how about 560 436 4040 . __eou__ i ’ m sorry . this number has already been registered . __eou__ how about 560-436-8976 ? __eou__ this number is ok . it ’ s still available . when would you like your phone number changed ? __eou__ as soon as possible . can i have it right now ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ thanks .
mark , you are not telling me the truth . now why ? __eou__ promise you are not going to be angry ? __eou__ yes , all right . so why ? go on then . say it . oh , really , mark . i promise i'm not going to be angry . now why were you late ? __eou__ i forgot . __eou__ you forgot ? you ... __eou__ ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?
did you promise me to get the bread ? __eou__ well , i remember walking pass the baker shop . __eou__ but you forgot to get the bread . __eou__ i'm afraid so . i don't remember you telling me about it . __eou__ well , i certainly did . __eou__ what would you let me do now ? __eou__ you are free . you can go now . __eou__ really ? you are so kind . __eou__ i'll do with the cake . __eou__ no . that's not enough . i've got some cereal .
you look upset , is there anything wrong ? __eou__ yes , to tell you the truth , there is . __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ well , i've lost my wallet and my id card . __eou__ oh , that's too bad ! i am sorry to hear that ! __eou__ forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk .
where were you last night , at exactly 920 pm ? __eou__ 920 pm , i couldn't say . i can't remember . __eou__ are you sure you can't remember ? __eou__ i'm absolutely certain . __eou__ were you in or out ? can you remember that ? __eou__ i'm not quite positive . i think i went out at about half pass nine . __eou__ did you see anyone come into the block flats ? __eou__ no , i didn't . __eou__ sure ? __eou__ quite sure .
hello . this is the directory assistance . can i help you ? __eou__ can you give me the number for jessica hanson on locks ave ? __eou__ i ’ m sorry . there is no listing under that name . are you sure of the name ? __eou__ yes , i ’ m pretty sure . __eou__ do you have her address ? __eou__ yes , i do . it ’ s 109 locks ave , l8v 4n9 . __eou__ that ’ s an unlisted number . i ’ m sorry , but i can ’ t give it to you . __eou__ i see . thanks anyway . __eou__ no problem .
hi , customer service desk . what can i do for you today , sir ? __eou__ good morning . i bought this vacuum here a few months ago . it doesn ’ t work now . can i return it or get it fixed ? __eou__ do you have your receipt with you ? __eou__ yes , i do . __eou__ when did you buy it from our store ? __eou__ four months ago . __eou__ i ’ m sorry . you can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . in order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase . __eou__ but the direction book says i will get one-year warranty . __eou__ yes , i know . after 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum . __eou__ okay . i understand . i ’ ll call the customer service office of the manufacturer . thank you . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
do you like chocolates ? __eou__ it depends . __eou__ do you like coffee ? __eou__ um . it ’ s delicious . __eou__ and do you like english food ? __eou__ not all of it .
are you sure this is the right restaurant ? __eou__ positive . __eou__ you don't think you could be wrong ? __eou__ i'm absolutely sure i'm right . __eou__ i don't know . it looks a little wrong down . __eou__ this is right . there is no doubt in my mind . __eou__ you're a hundred percent sure you want to eat here ? __eou__ check and double check .
here's the dress you wanted it to be made . __eou__ oh , dear ! __eou__ what's the matter ? __eou__ it's not what i asked for . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ it's not the right material . or the right color . i can't possibly accept it . __eou__ this is a pity !
i just love your hair that way . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ where did you have it done ? __eou__ my sister did it . when did you get yours cut ? __eou__ just yesterday . i'm still getting used to it . __eou__ well , it looks very nice . __eou__ thanks .

shall we have some soup first ? __eou__ no , thank you . i don't like soup . i'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . __eou__ ok , and what about the main course ? which would you rather have , fish or meat ? __eou__ meat , i think . __eou__ don't you like fish then ? __eou__ i do , but i want meat . __eou__ shall we have some white wine then ? __eou__ yes , but i prefer red wine with meat . __eou__ what would you like for dessert ? __eou__ i just want to have a coffee , i think . __eou__ fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? __eou__ no , thanks . i'd like to go straight home . i'm very tired .
are you ready to order ? may i suggest a veal ? __eou__ no , i'll have the fish please . __eou__ the chicken is also nice . __eou__ no , i want the fish . __eou__ our special tonight is lobster . __eou__ thank you , but i prefer the fish . __eou__ perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb . __eou__ no , i'd like the fish . __eou__ whatever you say .

how do you like the food here ? __eou__ i don't like it very much.but every-body likes their own food best . __eou__ there are many things i miss . you can't get the ingredients here . __eou__ are you sure ? all the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods . __eou__ perhaps . i just haven't had time to find them yet .
there are so many record players here . that is hard to choose . __eou__ look at this one . it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . __eou__ i'd rather get one with separated speakers.they give a clear sound . __eou__ yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . __eou__ that's right . now this one looks alright ? it's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it's sony . __eou__ let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .

a westerner said to his chinese friend . “ chinese people slurp when drinking soup . it ’ s disgusting . ” the chinese friend replied , “ westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . it ’ s even worse . ” __eou__ everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . the noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . __eou__ i attended a course on table manners while i was in the united states . some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the continental european way or the american way . we always said “ american way . ” it ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . what is the chinese way ? __eou__ the westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . the chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . i assume it is less complicated , right ? __eou__ not really . i did some research about chinese table manners . the important rule is to remain silent while eating . of course , this refers to family meals only . not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . it is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . the table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . each dish should be placed in the correct position . when fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . if it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . the diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . no noise should be made when chewing . no one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . one should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . all these table manners are very similar to western habits . __eou__ it seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . we do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” is there such an expression in chinese ? __eou__ yes . we say “ eat well and drink well . ”
please lend me some money . __eou__ ok , do you want it urgently ? __eou__ yeah , i really want it . i am on my uppers . __eou__ right , here you are . __eou__ thanks .
excuse me . do you know where i can find the nearest iccc ? __eou__ yes , but it's quite a ways . __eou__ do i need to take a bus ? __eou__ this bus doesn't take you directly there.you ' d have to change buses twice . i suggest you walk . it'll take you less than 20 minutes . __eou__ how do i get there on foot ? __eou__ go straight ahead through the intersection . __eou__ wait , let me write this down ... alright , i'm ready . __eou__ keep walking till ou pass the square , then turn right . walk past two lights and turn left at the third . __eou__ square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... and then ? __eou__ keep walking and look for a tall building . __eou__ tall building ... which side is the building on ? __eou__ the right side . iccc should be on the first floor . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you're welcome .

oh , my god ! i've been cheated ! __eou__ what ? what did you buy ? __eou__ it's a brick ! i can't believe how stupid i was . damn it ! __eou__ what is it ? why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ there was a guy on the sidewalk.he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes.he said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ and ? __eou__ so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ and it's a brick ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ i can't believe how stupid you are . why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.if it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new . __eou__ but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen . __eou__ aha ! now i understand.you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.so , what i think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it.we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ that's no problem.he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . that's easy.and probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.maybe his friend works in an electronics store . they sell video cameras there.probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.twenty dollars a brick . that's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ you're right , sarah . i was a fool . i can't believe it . how could i fall for such a trick ?
what ? your diamond ring is lost ? __eou__ yeah , i just cannot find it anywhere . __eou__ it must have been stolen by the few thieves . i ’ ll get it back for you . __eou__ you are risking your neck . don ’ t you know they have guns .
don ’ t be angry with them . after all , they are still children . __eou__ but i am still worry about them . i ’ m afraid ... __eou__ if i were you , i would not put crime in their doing these thing . we should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track . __eou__ well , i won ’ t put a crime into their doings .
you should not have criticize your son in front of his friends . __eou__ why ? he did something wrong . __eou__ i know . but at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds . __eou__ i only wanted to help him . __eou__ but it is not the right time .
the new year is coming . is the final examination approaching . __eou__ oh , yeah . we will have winter holiday . __eou__ how are you getting along with your studies ? __eou__ don ’ t worry , mum . i will study hard tomorrow . __eou__ but your were playing video games all afternoon . you are skating on thin ice .
i have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children . __eou__ what is your problem ? __eou__ my children can never be obedient even if i criticized them severely . __eou__ you need not always do that . why don ’ t you pat them on the back occasionally ?
where is our son , dear ? __eou__ he is in his bedroom . he has been in a bad mood after school . __eou__ what happened ? have you talked with him ? __eou__ yeah . he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor .
dad , can you buy a new camera ? my old one has gone west . __eou__ what ? i gave it to you only 3 months ago . __eou__ so , you didn ’ t buy a good one for me . this time how about a better one ? __eou__ ok , son . i think i ’ ve go to tell you the truth . my company has gone out and i ’ m now out of job . if you want a new camera , go and earn money yourself .
what are you doing ? __eou__ i ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf . __eou__ let regive you a hand . __eou__ no , thank you . i can manage it , i think .
jack , let ’ s go ! __eou__ oh , you are out of breath ! what happened ? __eou__ some people are wildly shooting on the next street . we must leave here as soon as possible ! __eou__ take it easy . they will get caught .
i don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ? __eou__ many children are learning drawing , dancing , swimming and so on in their spare time . you can follow suit . __eou__ but each children has his own interest . __eou__ well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision .
please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . __eou__ the exact time ? let me think . you know , it happened at night . __eou__ but we need the exact time . what time ? __eou__ oh , i remember . it was about 10 o'clock . when i was about to go to bed , suddenly i heard help outside .
can you please give me a hand ? i can ’ t carry the heavy box . __eou__ i ’ m afraid not . don ’ t you see i ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ? __eou__ i think you are flicking through it . __eou__ well , wait a minute .
sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . i have to deal with it . perhaps i will go to back home till very late . __eou__ it's nothing . it's not the first time anyway . __eou__ oh , come on . i will be back as early as possible . __eou__ i hope so .
hello ? __eou__ hi , david . you are very difficult to reach . i called several times . but i kept getting a busy signal . is your phone out of order ? __eou__ no , not out of order . but we seem to have a bad connection on the phone line . i can ’ t hear you clearly . __eou__ ok . let me call you later . is that okay ? __eou__ sure . thanks .
can you help me now ? __eou__ no , but i'll be able to tomorrow . __eou__ that'll be too late . __eou__ why don't you ask bill if he can help ? __eou__ i did , but he wasn't able to either .
there are so many eating utensils on the table . which ones do i use first ? __eou__ use them from the outside in . __eou__ i see . a set for appetizers and another for the main course . __eou__ right . we do the same thing at home . don't you remember ? __eou__ oh yeah . the big napkin goes on my lap . __eou__ let's look at our menus . __eou__ cindy , help me order because i'm still not very familiar with american cooking . __eou__ well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
why didn ’ t you call me last night ? __eou__ because i went out . __eou__ why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ? __eou__ i didn ’ t have any change . __eou__ tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then . __eou__ i don ’ t like all your questions . that ’ s why .
oh , hey , keri ! you cook , right ! you're a pretty good cook . __eou__ i'm ok . __eou__ i want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , i've never made one before . how do you make an omelet ? __eou__ well , i can teach you how i make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . __eou__ ok . yeah ! yeah ! __eou__ first you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . you put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ oh , ok . wow ! __eou__ ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__ wow . that sounds really good .
what're you doing now ? __eou__ i'm watching tv . __eou__ you're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . __eou__ i will . __eou__ and don't ever forget it .
well , peter , you have to do better than that next time , won't you ? __eou__ have i really got to do those exams again , dad ? __eou__ of course , you have . you must try harder this time . __eou__ and must i go back to school ? __eou__ no , you needn't do that . you'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . __eou__ but dad , i should be working full-time at my age . i'm nearly 17 . __eou__ you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams . you have to take a job and study . __eou__ what else i've got to do ? join the army ? __eou__ who knows ! that might come to later .
ah ! it hurts . don't touch it . __eou__ what part hurts ? __eou__ the shoulder . __eou__ well , maybe you broke it . but what i'm worried about is this cut . __eou__ it's not a cut . it's a gash ! it's bigger than a cut ! ah ! i need a doctor . __eou__ c'mon . just don't move . __eou__ i'm bleeding too much . __eou__ we don't have a decent first aid kit , do we ? __eou__ yes . my bike has one under the seat . get it , quick ! __eou__ there's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . i don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . what we need is a tourniquet . __eou__ wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.that will work as a tourniquet.after that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . __eou__ good plan . let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__ no , forget that ! do the tourniquet first . i'm losing too much blood . __eou__ alright , alright . how did you cut this so bad ? __eou__ i ran it against that fence pole as i crashed . what do you think ? damn , it hurts ! __eou__ we'll have to get you to a hospital . i can ride you on the back of my bike . __eou__ i'm lucky i wasn't killed . i must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.there was too much gravel on that corner . i slid out . __eou__ yes , i almost slid too.alright . this tourniquet is tight . how does it feel ? __eou__ make it tighter . i want the blood stopped.then wrap some bandages around the cut . then we can go . ouch ! i hope i can walk . __eou__ alright , i'm twisting it around . you tell me when to stop . __eou__ there . stop !
well , i'm glad you're finally back . i was wondering what happened . __eou__ i feel kind of stupid . __eou__ why ? __eou__ we got lost coming back . i guess i don't really know this town yet . __eou__ you got lost . you're kidding ! __eou__ no . we took a wrong turn somewhere.and joseph doesn't know the town at all . so i started giving him directions.but i didn't really know where we were . so we got seriously lost . __eou__ you could have called . __eou__ i know i could have . but finally we asked someone where we were . __eou__ you've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ? __eou__ guess where we ended up . __eou__ i don't know . where ? __eou__ when we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in grangerfield . __eou__ grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ? __eou__ i don't know.the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . __eou__ grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . __eou__ i know it is . i don't know how it happened . __eou__ hmm , maybe i do . __eou__ what ? __eou__ maybe i have an idea how it happened . __eou__ how ? __eou__ you were too busy looking at joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . __eou__ oh , that's what you think , huh ?
excuse me . __eou__ yes ? what can i do for you ? __eou__ i just checked in , and there's a problem with my room . __eou__ and what is the problem ? __eou__ i asked for a non-smoking room , and i don't have one.my room smells like cigarette smoke . i can't stand it.could you change my room , please ? __eou__ let me see ... i'm sorry , but we don't have any more non-smoking rooms.we won't charge you for your room tonight . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ i'm very sorry about this . __eou__ that's ok . thanks for your help .
what's the matter , paul ? __eou__ can you believe this ? i locked my keys in the car , and i have to go to the airport to pick up my aunt . __eou__ so , what are you going to do ? __eou__ i don't know ... hey , do you think i could borrow your car for a few hours ? __eou__ i'm sorry , but i really need it this afternoon . __eou__ well , could you drive me home ? i have spare keys there . __eou__ sure . that's no problem . __eou__ oh , and andy ? do you have a quarter for the phone ? my wallet's in the car . __eou__ here you go . anything else ? __eou__ no , that's it . thanks . i really appreciate it .
how silly of you to jump out of the window ! __eou__ but that was the first thing that came into my mind when i heard the shout earthquake ! __eou__ why not use staircases ? the terror was not so violent at that time . __eou__ that would be too late . __eou__ maybe the situation is too urgent . __eou__ yes , i think i should have jumped in any case .
what are you looking for ? __eou__ i lost one of my contact lenses , and i ’ m searching high and low for it . __eou__ where did you lose it ? maybe i can help you to find it . __eou__ thank you very much . i think i lost it near the window .

i don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . he says painful words everyday . __eou__ what words ? can you tell me ? __eou__ he says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy , very quickly if i do something that he doesn ’ t like . you know , if i wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . __eou__ honey , i don ’ t know what to tell you . of course tony is a young child . but do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . __eou__ yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . __eou__ i suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . if he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . __eou__ it ’ s easy to say , but i will try . __eou__ motivate tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . __eou__ i know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . but this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .

oh , hey , keri ! you cook , right ! you're a pretty good cook . __eou__ i'm ok . __eou__ ok . i want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , i've never made one before . how do you make an omelet ? __eou__ ok , well , i can teach you how i make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . __eou__ ok . yeah ! yeah ! __eou__ first you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . you put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ oh , ok . wow ! __eou__ ok . and keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . __eou__ wow . that sounds really good . __eou__ mm , it is . __eou__ wow . what fillings do you recommend ? __eou__ um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . if you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . so it's actually cooked in it . it's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and jack cheese .

aunt shirley , i heard the yuan miao festival is the name for the festival . why did it get its name ? __eou__ well , the first lunar month is called yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night miao . and you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . __eou__ oh , i see . i also heard today is the last day for the street fair . can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks . __eou__ sure . it ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . then , which one would you like ? __eou__ can you recommend some must-try ? __eou__ ok . let ’ s go over there . for the lantern festival , you should never omit the yuanxiao . __eou__ what ’ s that ? it gets the name from the festival itself . that ’ s really funny ! __eou__ actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . they are like tangun . __eou__ oh , i know tangyuan . it ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert . __eou__ yes . and also , we can find yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings . __eou__ i ’ d like to try the salty ones . where does that strange smell come from ? __eou__ oh , the smelly bean curd . my favorite !
daddy , i am so glad you come out with us . __eou__ honey , i am sorry that i am too busy most of the time . __eou__ it doesn't matter . but i really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time . __eou__ what did you do last weekend ? __eou__ it was boring . just did my homework and practiced the piano . __eou__ did you play football with other children ? __eou__ ahh , i was not available last sunday . i was too busy almost as much as you . __eou__ cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park . __eou__ hooray ! i can play football with daddy . mom and sister can play badminton . __eou__ after that , we will have a picnic . __eou__ that's great . we can also take the dragon kite with us . after the picnic , we can fly it . __eou__ okay , it sounds good .

what can i do for you ? __eou__ i've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash . __eou__ ok , let me see . this white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned . __eou__ that's ok . but that must be costly . __eou__ yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . but for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' . __eou__ oh , my wife just threw them into the washer . __eou__ did it ever shrink or fade ? generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually . __eou__ i see . the woolen sweater shrunk in the wash . __eou__ never mind . you can leave them to me . __eou__ oh , thanks . you know , i know little about this , so please tell me something that i should pay more attention to when i do washing . __eou__ it's very simple . divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . if you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know . __eou__ i'll keep that in mind . and how much is it altogether ? __eou__ that will be 80 yuan altogether . here is your invoice .

what can i do ? __eou__ the system crashed when i was surfing on the internet . __eou__ did you go to any illegal website ? __eou__ no , but does that matter ? __eou__ yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that . __eou__ i see . i'd better never try . __eou__ that's wise . __eou__ do you know what's wrong with my pc ? __eou__ one minute . oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software . __eou__ is anti-virus software necessary for a pc ? __eou__ of course . you'd better learn something about it . __eou__ i'm afraid yes . but what about the data i stored in the computer ? __eou__ don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . and i take an anti-virus software with me . do you want me to install it now ? __eou__ yes , please . i'll really appreciate that .
what did the boss say ? __eou__ he asked me if i'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? __eou__ you are still student so i don't think you should have time for that . __eou__ don't worry about that . he said i can do that at spare time . anyway , it's just a part-time job . __eou__ okay , then . what kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ? __eou__ it's a weekly newspaper named olympic english . so i need to be here only on sunday . __eou__ sounds interesting . especially that we are olympic volunteers . __eou__ that's exactly what i am thinking about , and also it's a good way to get social experiences . __eou__ and a good way to get some pocket money . __eou__ let's do it together . __eou__ i'll say yes . wait a minute . i need an ic card . __eou__ for what ? you have a telephone at home , don't you ? __eou__ yes , but i don't want my mom to tap my phone when i call clive .
dad , hurry ! the train is coming . aha , i am a superman . __eou__ don't rush , behave yourself please ! let the people get off first . __eou__ oh , we should . there are so many people . what if the train got full before we could get in ? __eou__ but , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either . __eou__ how many stops are there to the aidan station ? __eou__ there are four more stops . __eou__ oh , my god ! __eou__ what's wrong ? you are like a little monkey , on pins and needles ! __eou__ because i need to use the restroom . is there a restroom on the train ? __eou__ no , not on the train , but in the station . __eou__ why not ? you told me that subway is a kind of train . if it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ? __eou__ well , that is a question . you want to offer a suggestion ? __eou__ oh , yeah , but not today . i am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible . __eou__ i guess you'll never forget today .
excuse me ? can you do me a favor , please ? __eou__ it's my pleasure , what can i do for you ? __eou__ i'm from england and i'm trying to make a travel plan for today . __eou__ what brings you here ? __eou__ i'm a flight attendant and i'm here on vacation . __eou__ where are you staying ? __eou__ i live in the holiday inn lido hotel . __eou__ oh , it's not very far . and as far as i know it is a fancy place . __eou__ yes , it is . do you know where i can get a town map ? __eou__ we sell them , right here . __eou__ great , do you have any for foreigners ? i mean english version ?
daniel , here is some money for the tickets . __eou__ ok , it's my pleasure . how many tickets ? __eou__ oh , like a gentleman . two tickets for two people . __eou__ but i am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets . __eou__ they may unless we get a half-price ticket for you . __eou__ dad , it makes no sense . __eou__ you may ask if you can take a half-price ticket . __eou__ yeah , i make certain . a half-price ticket cuts us one point five yuan .
i've heard that you provide very good service , so when i need a mover , i call you guys first . __eou__ thanks a lot for calling us . could you tell me more about what you need us to do ? __eou__ oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . it is about 15 kilometers to get there . __eou__ ok , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move . __eou__ how much will it cost in that case ? __eou__ oh , let me see . it fits the second standard rates . have a look at the contract , please . __eou__ your charge is divided into two parts , the payment in advance and the rest . i thought that i should pay all of it before moving . __eou__ no , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving . __eou__ the damage and compensation item confuses me . could you give some explanation ? __eou__ ok . if any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department .
that was really a nightmare ! __eou__ honey , what's up ? __eou__ i was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . __eou__ oh , really ? i know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? __eou__ i pressed the emergency button ! and then i stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . __eou__ did you panic at the time ? __eou__ a little bit , but i know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least i wouldn't be smothered there . __eou__ was there anyone else with you ? __eou__ of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying . __eou__ so you mean that you were the only brave one there ? __eou__ yes . i have to call the property management . __eou__ for what ? complaining about what happened in the elevator ? __eou__ yes . they should check the elevator regularly . i have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . __eou__ that was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . i think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on . __eou__ i know what you mean , but i'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . that has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .
hi , my name is ted , what's yours ? __eou__ what ? __eou__ i said , i'm ted , who are you ? __eou__ huh ? oh , my name is laura . __eou__ do you come here often , laura ? __eou__ huh ? i can't hear you , the music's too loud . __eou__ let's go outside and talk . so laura , do you come here often ? __eou__ hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? __eou__ i asked if you come here often . __eou__ sometimes , usually once every few weeks . do you ? __eou__ no , this is my first time here . __eou__ i usually come with a group of friends . we dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . __eou__ yeah , that's why i'm here . my friends dragged me here , because they think i spend too much time studying . __eou__ that's good . it's good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . __eou__ i guess so . but the music is too loud . i don't mind getting out and meeting people , but next time i'll do it in a park .
why are you reading the classifieds ? what do you need ? __eou__ i'm looking for a bookcase , but i don't want to buy a new one . __eou__ are you having any luck ? __eou__ not really . there aren't any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i'll go to them . __eou__ do you mind if i go with you ? __eou__ not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . __eou__ i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining , but i had a problem the other day at kimble's department store . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . it was priced at forty dollars , so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
so what do you think of my new dress ? __eou__ i think it's great ! i really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . i've actually been eyeing that dress at maxine's for a while now , but i wasn't sure i could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . __eou__ um , ninety-five dollars ? __eou__ yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why , how much did you pay for it ? __eou__ i bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at helen's boutique . i didn't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else . __eou__ of course ! everything at helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why didn't you shop around ? __eou__ i don't know , i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it . i guess i was too impulsive .
come in and have some coffee , anna . the kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . __eou__ i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday . __eou__ they spend hours there , especially on weekends . __eou__ speaking of that trip , alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? __eou__ i know several . but wouldn't it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? __eou__ isn't that complicated ? __eou__ no , it's easy . we'll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . they'll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . __eou__ we ? do you want to go with me ? __eou__ sure . i love going to the mall . __eou__ what do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ?
hey joe , what are you doing in this department store ? __eou__ hi , rita , i'm just looking for a pair of shoes . i won't be here for long . __eou__ why not ? when i go shoe shopping , i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices . __eou__ that's my problem . i don't have a lot of options . __eou__ what do you mean ? this is a big store , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , but i have unusually big feet . that wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that i can fit into . __eou__ so how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? __eou__ well , first of all , i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . __eou__ well , you're in the right store . if they don't have it , no one will . __eou__ after that i choose something from one of the few brands that i know will fit me . i prefer white , so i ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . since i ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
sir , may i please see your license and registration ? do you know how fast you were going ? __eou__ no , i'm not sure . i think about 65 mph , right ? __eou__ you're not sure ? you were going at 90 miles per hour ! that's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! have you been drinking ? __eou__ no , officer , not at all . __eou__ then how can you explain your behavior ? __eou__ well , i guess i just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer . __eou__ not paying attention to the speedometer ? why not ? __eou__ um , because i was busy talking to my friend . __eou__ on a cell phone ? __eou__ yes , i was using a cell phone . i just bought it , so i decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . while i did that i also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food i had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess i had too many distractions . __eou__ that's definitely true . i'm going to have to give you a ticket . please remember to drive more carefully next time .
let ’ s move out of here . this apartment is too small . __eou__ i agree . i ’ ll look in the paper . __eou__ a house would be great . i could plant a garden . and you could use the garage for a workshop . __eou__ here ’ s an interesting ad __eou__ how much is the rent ? __eou__ the ad says $ 325 plus deposit . __eou__ when is the place available ? __eou__ it ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . you won ’ t be far from work .
i can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in new york city . __eou__ oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? __eou__ of course i had heard about that , but now i know how expensive it is to rent a place here . __eou__ i don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in new york . __eou__ why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__ yeah , but so what ! i ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . and , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .
can you tell me how to reach the bank please ? __eou__ which bank ? there are two , the allied irish bank and the bank of ireland . __eou__ i have an air pass card and i want to withdraw money from the bank . __eou__ you need to go to the allied irish bank which is near the local shopping centre , dunned stores . __eou__ how do i get there . i have no knowledge of this area . __eou__ cross the road and turn left at the other side . walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights . you will see a shopping centre on the right hand side . walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre . keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left . __eou__ it sounds very complicated . how far is it from here ? __eou__ it's not so complicated . it's about five minutes walk from here . i can draw a map for you if you wish . __eou__ oh , i would really appreciate that . by the way will i be going north or south ? __eou__ you will be going northwards . you are now in the the western part of the city and the allied irish bank is situated in the north east . here's a rough sketch of the area .
what does a housing go for in south mountain district ? __eou__ it depends on the type of the house you're looking for . __eou__ we ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home . __eou__ what ’ s your general price range ? __eou__ under 300,000 rib , we suppose . __eou__ umm , i think i would be hard to find something in that range in this area . you know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest . __eou__ what about a two-bedroom house ? __eou__ a two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 rib . __eou__ i see . __eou__ i recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . it is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family . __eou__ okay , i will take it into consideration .
hey there chris , what are you up to ? __eou__ i'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . __eou__ oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? __eou__ yeah , it looks that way . my wife has been bugging me about it . i thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . __eou__ so this would be your first automobile ? __eou__ that's right . for quite a few years , i rode a bicycle to work . then i got a motorbike . __eou__ yeah , i think i can understand your wife's position . asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . __eou__ oh ... i don't let her ride with me . it's just too dangerous . she takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . __eou__ so it's time to buy your very first car ! wow , that's exciting ! __eou__ yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . __eou__ yeah . i still remember my first car . it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned 17 . i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . __eou__ i'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . __eou__ yeah , it is a tough call . each one has its pros and cons . are you looking for a sedan ? __eou__ yes , i'd like a jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . __eou__ i'd advise you to listen to your wife . she will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .
this house is very nice for me , but i can ’ t afford it in a lump sum . __eou__ don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once . __eou__ that ’ s good . will you tell me the details ? __eou__ certainly , you need to pay a deposit at first , and you will pay the rest monthly . __eou__ how long will it take ? __eou__ it depends . __eou__ i need to talk it over with my wife . __eou__ certainly .
i heard you are looking for a house . __eou__ yes . __eou__ how is this going ? __eou__ i haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet . __eou__ i can recommend an apartment for you . a friend of mine is about to move . she doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer . __eou__ where is the house ? __eou__ it is on spring avenue . __eou__ really ! so it is just near my office building . great ! how much is the rent ? __eou__ it ’ s $ 240 a month . __eou__ does that include utilities ? __eou__ it includes water , but not gas and electricity . __eou__ that ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ but it ’ s very convenient for you to walk to work . __eou__ yes . i won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . is it a one-bedroom apartment ? __eou__ yes , it is . __eou__ that is what i am looking for . could i go to see the house tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ certainly ! but i have to contact my friend first . __eou__ all right ! thank you .

ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . i don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! __eou__ i know , i know . ok , so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . __eou__ right . you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . for example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . __eou__ so complicated ! ok , what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ? __eou__ since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . __eou__ cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? __eou__ no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . __eou__ you know what ? i ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned .
what do you think of this dress ? do you think it suits me ? __eou__ sure . why don ’ t you try it on ? the fitting room is over there . __eou__ it ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! have you seen anything you like ? __eou__ i ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter . __eou__ it looks too big for you , but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ? __eou__ yes , it ’ s half price . it ’ s supposed to be too large-that ’ s the fashion . __eou__ i might get one too , but in a different colour . i prefer light blue to while . __eou__ there . it looks great , don ’ t you think ? i ’ m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i need a new pair . i ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . __eou__ i ’ m getting this beret – doesn ’ t it look cool ? i ’ d like to get some jeans too , but i don ’ t have enough cash on me . __eou__ don ’ t worry . i ’ ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later . __eou__ thanks ! now i don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time .
good morning . i understand that you ’ ve got a problem with your washing machine . i ’ m from the repair company . __eou__ excellent . come in please . the washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . it keeps breaking down . __eou__ when did it first break down ? __eou__ about ten days ago . i ’ ve tried to use it since then . sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating . __eou__ is it still under warranty . if it is and i can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . __eou__ yes , it ’ s still under warranty . over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high-pitch noise when it ’ s in use . __eou__ ok . i ’ ll start by looking at the motor . i ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . there ’ s the problem . it ’ s quite simple . i ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ part of the motor is loose . i can put it back in place quite easily . __eou__ that ’ s great . thanks very much . would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?

excuse me . do you know where i can find the nearest iccc ? __eou__ yes , but it's quite a ways . __eou__ do i need to take a bus ? __eou__ this bus doesn't take you directly there . you'd have to change buses twice . i suggest you walk . it'll take you less than 20 minutes . __eou__ how do i get there on foot ? __eou__ go straight ahead through the intersection . __eou__ wait , let me write this down ... alright , i'm ready . __eou__ keep walking till you pass the square , then turn right . walk past two lights and turn left at the third . __eou__ square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... and then ? __eou__ keep walking and look for a tall building . __eou__ tall building ... which side is the building on ? __eou__ the right side . iccc should be on the first floor . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you're welcome .

i ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but i ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . could you give me some advice ? __eou__ certainly ! the first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . dogs are very demanding . you need to take them for walks and they love to play . cats , on the other hand , are more independent . __eou__ i ’ m fairly busy , so i really need an animal that i don ’ t need to care of very much . actually , i ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . i don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . is that a problem ? __eou__ not really . by the way , i don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . __eou__ we have those , but i only sell them to people i know well , for obvious reasons . how about a lizard ? i have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . __eou__ that sounds ideal . could you show me some ? __eou__ sure . come over here . as you can see , i have a wide selection of species . they can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . do you have a favourite colour ? __eou__ i like the red one . what do they eat ? __eou__ you can feed them on various things . they will eat small pieces of meat , but i ’ d recommend insects . you can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . i sell them here . __eou__ thanks a lot . what i ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . __eou__ that ’ s fine . you shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .
i think i should join a fitness centre . i am getting a little fat and i'm totally out of shape . even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath . __eou__ i'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . you really need to stop smoking . that's the main reason you're unhealthy . __eou__ i guess you're right . i've tried stopping , but i just can't seem to quit . __eou__ why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? how many do you smoke each day now ? __eou__ i smoke around 30 each day . __eou__ ok . so for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . at the end of the month , you'll have quit . you should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . you don't need to jog far . __eou__ if i do a few exercises at home , like crunches , i'll soon deal with this waistline . __eou__ be careful when you go jogging . don't put yourself under too much stress . you're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition . __eou__ i'll join a fitness centre . i'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . there's one near my office , so i can go before and after work . i don't want to go jogging in the street , so i'll use a treadmill . __eou__ good idea . remember to eat healthily too . the trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet .
hello ! nice to see you here at the finest centre again . what exercises are you going to do today ? __eou__ i'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill . then i think i'll do some work with the dumbbless . __eou__ good idea . i'd suggest you do some crunches too . thery're great for getting in shape . make sure you do them correctly . __eou__ ok . i will . could you help me with the treadmill ? i found it difficult to get the setting right last time . __eou__ sure . is today only you second visit ? __eou__ yes , it is . i'll be coming here regularly . i think i need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape . __eou__ the treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . you can increase that later . __eou__ i was told that the first time i came heer . i was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first . i need to build up slowly . __eou__ that's right . you don't want to injure yourself by exercising too much or in the wrong way . now , this is how you make the settings for the treadmill ...
what do we need for the barbecue ? __eou__ well , i ’ ve bought a lot of meat . i ’ ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties . __eou__ i can ’ t wait to start cooking ! i ’ ve bought the grill and charcoal . do you have enough plates and utensils ? __eou__ i think so . i bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . it will save on the washing up ! __eou__ and if people drop them , they won ’ t break . we ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . __eou__ they sell them at the shop around the corner . we can go and get some in a few minutes . __eou__ i brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . we ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce . __eou__ i have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop . __eou__ how long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ? __eou__ it only takes a few minutes . some people like their meat well done . others like it rare . the great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . __eou__ they can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it . __eou__ i hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians !
do you like cooking ? __eou__ i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ? __eou__ i don ’ t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having to clean up after the meal . i can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . __eou__ you can ask the guests to help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes . __eou__ so , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food . __eou__ italian , indian , and chinese . i ’ ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice . __eou__ do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ? __eou__ not at all . you can find most of them at supermarket . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . __eou__ how long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ? __eou__ obviously , it depends on what i'm cooking , but i'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? __eou__ we eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef . you eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , we do . we also eat a lot of lamb . __eou__ yes . i ’ ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops . __eou__ that ’ s right . they tastes so good ! we eat them with mint sauce . have you every tried them ? __eou__ yes , i have . i tried them when i visited your country last year . i thought they were very tasty . can you cook them ? __eou__ i certainly can . if i can get some from the butcher ’ s , i ’ ll cook them for you . __eou__ that sounds great . i'll bring a bottle of wine .
mom ! i hate eating vegetables ! __eou__ you don ’ t have to eat them . i don ’ t mind . __eou__ thanks mom ! can i have dessert now ? i love chocolate cake ! __eou__ no dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables . __eou__ but i don ’ t like them ! it ’ s not fair ! __eou__ you can have some fruit for dessert . if you eat an apple and a banana , i might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . __eou__ ok ... actually , i don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy i hate broccoli and cauliflower . __eou__ i ’ ll remember that for next time . you ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . ok ? __eou__ thanks mom !
it ’ s a beautiful day here in new zealand at the men ’ s volleyball world championship . my name is rick fields and i ’ m joined by the man with the plan , bob copeland . __eou__ thank you , rick . we ’ ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , brazil and china , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__ the ref signals the start of the game and here we go . ribero serves and china quickly receives the ball . chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by chen ! __eou__ xu spikes it ! wow , what a great hit ! the brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! great play . __eou__ it ’ s china ’ s service now . what a superb jump serve by li , oh , and we have a let serve . the ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__ brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break .
welcome back racing fans ! my name is rick fields and , as always , i am joined by my partner in crime , bob copeland . __eou__ we ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and kimmi rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! they are heading to turn three and lewis hamilton tries to pass rikknen ! it ’ s a close one and , oh no ! hamilton hits the wall ! __eou__ he came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . we have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . __eou__ the cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! __eou__ smoke is coming out of his car ! he seems to be having engine trouble ! he makes his way into the pit , and fernando alonso takes the lead ! __eou__ how unlucky for rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , alonso takes the checkered flag !
do you do a lot of your shopping online ? __eou__ not really . i like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i ’ m buying before i pay for it . sometimes , i ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . you don ’ t like buying things online , do you ? __eou__ no . i ’ m a little worried about security . you never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . aren ’ t you worry about that ? __eou__ not really . i know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities , i don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop . __eou__ i ’ m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological . __eou__ i do . i ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but i don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people . __eou__ so , how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . __eou__ sure . i ’ d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something . __eou__ sure . while you ’ re in the computer store . i will visit the book store opposite . i like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting . __eou__ ok . i ’ ve finished online . let ’ s go . i ’ ll just get some money and my credit card . __eou__ thanks for reminding me . i had forgotten to get mine .
the bathroom looks lovely . did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? __eou__ i did it myself . i went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . then i went to diy shop and bought everything i needed . i ’ m sure i saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . i learnt a lot by doing it myself . __eou__ so , let ’ s see . you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . you ’ ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . the bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ yes , they are . i gave them a good clean . they are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . __eou__ how long did it take you to do the tiling . __eou__ as i hadn ’ t done it before , i had to keep referring to income 3ation i got from the internet . doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . then i spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether . __eou__ i think you ’ ve done a very good job . as least as good as a professional would do . perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom ? __eou__ you ’ ll be lucky ! however , i ’ ll print out the income 3ation i got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
good morning . i ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . could you help me ? __eou__ certainly . as you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . __eou__ i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it ’ s on sale , isn't it ? __eou__ yes . the price has been reduced by 50 % . it ’ s a real bargain . __eou__ i ’ ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ? __eou__ it ’ s quite large . it ’ s about 40 square metres . __eou__ i ’ d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better . __eou__ ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ’ ll just browse through those ones over there .
i have redecorated my bedroom . i decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . i also bought a new pair of curtains . what do you think of it ? __eou__ i think is looks great . i really like the light colors you have chosen . the pictures are nice too . did you buy any new furniture ? __eou__ i bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . i also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . __eou__ new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . i see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . __eou__ do you think that i should get a new wardrobe ? __eou__ that wardrobe looks quite big . is it full of clothes ? __eou__ yes . i have some many clothes stuffed into it . perhaps i should get rid of some of them . there are clothes in there that i never wear anymore . __eou__ i like to get rid of clothes that i don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . they take up too much space . there are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . they will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . after i get rid of the old clothes i no longer wear , i can see what new clothes i need to buy . __eou__ i need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . perhaps we can go together one day . __eou__ ok . i ’ ll let you know when i ’ ve sorted out my clothes .
i ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . i bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . what do you think of this ? __eou__ that looks good . the room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room . __eou__ i ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe . __eou__ you would fit both of them in your bedroom . perhaps you could also get the dressing table . i think that one would look good in your bedroom . __eou__ yes , it would . it ’ s very expensive though . __eou__ everything in this magazine seems expensive . you could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store . __eou__ yes . i ’ m sure i could find something similar at one . i ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom . __eou__ you can get cheap carpets easily . another idea is to buy a rug . that would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . it would save you a lot of work . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . i ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .
do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country ? __eou__ yes , we do . the most popular vegetables are potatoes , carrots , peas , and cauliflower . the most popular fruit are apples , bananas , pears , peaches , grapes , and oranges . do you like vegetables ? __eou__ i like them very much . we also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds . __eou__ which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ? __eou__ we eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant . __eou__ i love eggplant ! unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so i don ’ t eat it often . __eou__ why is it relatively expensive ? __eou__ because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . we import a lot from other countries . __eou__ i see . we grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . we export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . in your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? it's very popular in my country . __eou__ we eat it in my country too , but i wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . __eou__ do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . __eou__ a lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . i prefer to buy fresh vegetables .
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? i don ’ t think i can finish everything in time . __eou__ ok , what do you want me to do ? __eou__ first of all , i need you to do the drying up . i ’ m almost finished the washing up . i ’ m going to clean the cooker when i finish . __eou__ ok . i ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as i dry them . where is the tea towel ? oh , here it is . __eou__ we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . __eou__ while you ’ re cleaning the cooker , i ’ ll wipe the worktop . that was a great meal , by the way . __eou__ actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . i made far too much food to eat alone . i am glad you could come over to help me finish it . __eou__ my pleasure ! this tea towel ’ s a little ragged . do you have another one ? __eou__ yes . look in that drawer . i should throw the old one out . __eou__ keep it and use it as rag . you can clean your bicycle with it .
have you seen bill recently ? __eou__ yes . he ’ s in hospital with a bad back . one morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . his wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . he ’ s been there for a few days now . __eou__ daisy ’ s in hospital too . she god food poisoning last week . she thinks she got it from some bad seafood . __eou__ you have to be very careful with seafood . it tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . have you heard anything from tom ? __eou__ he ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . he probably just had a cold . __eou__ he might be allergic to pollen . my niece is allergic to pollen . it seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy . __eou__ i see . my niece just flew back from australia to visit . she ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow . __eou__ it ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . thinking of all these ailments , i got a splinter the other day . it took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . look . __eou__ oh , your hand is still sore . you should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . you ’ ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . __eou__ yes , i banged it against to cooker yesterday . it really hurt , but it ’ s ok now . the bruise will disappear soon .
how do you use an atm card , billy ? __eou__ it ’ s easy grandpa . insert you card into the machine here . then wait a moment . ok . now you enter your pin . it should have four numbers . __eou__ oh yes . i ’ ve got it written down here . just a minute . __eou__ you really shouldn ’ t write it down . you should memorise it . you can change it to a more convenient number if you like . __eou__ ok , i ’ ve entered my pin . there are several options on the screen . i guess i just choose which service i want , don ’ t i ? __eou__ yes . choose the service you need to use . if you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . __eou__ i can just enter the amount using the key , right ? __eou__ that ’ s right . give the machine a moment to process you request . then take your money . __eou__ these machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . in fact , i quite like them . they are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .
i ’ d like to send this parcel to australia . __eou__ certainly . could you put it on the scales , so i can check the weight ? __eou__ sure . it ’ s not very heavy . __eou__ that ’ s 850 grams . the coasts depends on how you would like to send it . __eou__ i see . what are the options ? i suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail . __eou__ that ’ s right . sending it by airmail will cost twelve dollars and sending it by surface mail will cost eight dollars . __eou__ how long will it take to get there ? __eou__ airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks . __eou__ it that case , i ’ ll send it by airmail . i ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel . __eou__ no problem . that ’ s one dollar extra . __eou__ thanks very much . there ’ s thirteen dollars . __eou__ there ’ s you receipt . goodbye .

ok , i ’ ve got an up-to-day map . let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . __eou__ where are we ? oh , here we are . so we drive to the a120 and turn left . __eou__ no , we turn right . remember that we are coming from this direction . __eou__ oh yes ! sorry ! then we drive to the m11 motorway . __eou__ how far is that ? __eou__ it ’ s only seven miles . we turn left to join the motorway and drive south . __eou__ according to the map , we get off the m11 at the second junction and join the m25 . that ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of london . __eou__ that ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far . __eou__ then we drive west on the m25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction ! __eou__ then we drive on the m25 . it turns south . when we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the m4 . __eou__ then we take the first heathrow airport . what ’ s the total distance ? __eou__ the journey around the m25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . so how many miles is that together ? __eou__ 22 miles to the m25 , 33 miles on the m25 , and 3 after that . that ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ it shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way . __eou__ we can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . i think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . being early is much better than being late .
dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? __eou__ i'm afraid i can't . __eou__ why ? __eou__ well , my car won't start . i don't know what's the matter with it . __eou__ could it be the battery ? __eou__ no , i don't think it could be . i checked the battery two days ago . it must be other problems . __eou__ well , i suppose it could be the gas . __eou__ no , there is plenty of gas . i filled it up yesterday . __eou__ perhaps it's the starter then ? __eou__ yes , that's possible .
excuse me , can you tell me the way to holton railway station ? __eou__ sure . it ’ s quite far from here . don ’ t worry , though . it ’ s not difficult to get there . __eou__ i think i ’ m going in the wrong direction , aren ’ t ? __eou__ yes . first , you need to turn around . do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ? __eou__ yes , i do . they are about two miles away , right ? __eou__ that ’ s right . drive back to the traffic rights and turn right . follow the road for about a mile , until you see the plaza hotel . it ’ s a really big hotel . you can ’ t miss it . turn left at the hotel . __eou__ so , right at the traffic lights two miles up the road , then left at the plaza hotel , a mile along that road . got it . __eou__ then you just go straight on until you see the station ahead of you . __eou__ ok . got it . thanks for you help . __eou__ no problem .

can i give you a lift home , mrs word ? __eou__ that is very kind of you , mr lee . thank you . __eou__ could you hold my umbrella when i get my keys out , please ? __eou__ of course . it ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ dreadful . there , the door is open now . __eou__ thank you .

would you like to come by and play bridge ? __eou__ well , let's see . why don't we go dancing for a change ? we haven't done that for a long time . __eou__ well , to tell the truth , i don't really feel like it tonight . i had a pretty hard day and i'm sort of tired . __eou__ hmm . well , in that case , we could go to the movies . __eou__ oh , we always go to the movies . can't we do something different ? __eou__ well , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ let's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ? __eou__ it's ok with me , but we don't have any beer and things . __eou__ well , shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over , and i'll go to the store and buy some stuff . __eou__ ok . __eou__ hello , janet . it's me ... oh , fine . just fine . say , janet , i was wondering if you and tom were doing anything tonight ... no ? well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
here's the dress you wanted to be made . __eou__ oh , dear ! __eou__ what's the matter ? __eou__ it's not what i asked for . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ it's not the right material . or the right color . i can't possibly accept it . __eou__ this is a pity !
so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? that refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ yes . i needed a large one . before , i had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . __eou__ that ’ s usual nowadays . you ’ ve added a few shelves too . __eou__ yes . you know i ’ ve been cooking more kind of food recently and i needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . __eou__ did you buy new cupboards too ? __eou__ no , i didn ’ t . i gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . the worktop was in poor condition , so i had a new one added . __eou__ i see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . __eou__ yes , i have . i need them to help me with these new dished i ’ m trying to make . i need a little more practice before i invite guests over . __eou__ looking at the spice rack , i ’ d say you ’ ve been learning how to make asian food . __eou__ yes . i ’ ve always likes indian and thai food , so i ’ ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . i ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but i still need practice at making thai food . __eou__ both kinds of food are becoming popular . nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . __eou__ i hope you can stay for dinner . i need a guinea pig !
sorry . what was that you said ? __eou__ i'll meet you at the gate round about seven . __eou__ where ? __eou__ at the gate . __eou__ when , did you say ? __eou__ round about seven . __eou__ who's coming ? __eou__ peter . peter brown , you know . don't forget to bring the letter . __eou__ sorry . i didn't quite catch what you said . there's a lot of noise outside . __eou__ i told you not to forget to bring the letter . __eou__ loretta ? no , she can't come , she's busy .
we'd like to rent a flat near the university . __eou__ are you looking for somewhere for two people ? __eou__ yes , we are . obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . we've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month . __eou__ yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . do you have any other requirements ? __eou__ not really , no . we'd preferably like to live in a quiet street . __eou__ how many rooms do you need in the flat ? __eou__ we'll need two bedrooms . the kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined . __eou__ ok . i've got a list of place that fit your requirements . let's just go through them . the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from the university . __eou__ how far away is it from the campus ? __eou__ it's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . the cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a main street . __eou__ that sounds ideal . can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . __eou__ of course . i'm not very busy at the moment . if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . i can take you there . __eou__ thank you . that would be great .
can you assure the quality of this air conditioner ? __eou__ yes , ma'ma . there'll be no problem with the quality . __eou__ what if there's something wrong with it ? __eou__ you don't have to worry about it . we have a one year warranty . __eou__ are you sure ? __eou__ sure . we have a good after-sale service . your satisfaction is guaranteed .
what kind of place shall we rent ? __eou__ it should be close to the university . neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . __eou__ absolutely . that's the most important thing to take into consideration . i'm not too worried about the size of the flat . __eou__ neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . do you mind if it's in a noisy area . __eou__ i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . __eou__ good point . ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . __eou__ yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . __eou__ how much do you think the rent will be ? __eou__ i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
i like this apartment . do you think we can afford the mortgage ? __eou__ yes . i think so . it ’ s not a very expensive apartment . it ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . the rooms are quite large too . __eou__ i love the balcony . we can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . we are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . __eou__ the neighbourhood is nice too . there is a park nearby . __eou__ yes , and there are many houses nearby . i like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . __eou__ it ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . a garden would be so nice . __eou__ yes , it would . don ’ t worry . there ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . this place will be fine . __eou__ the building is quite new and well constructed . i ’ m happy with the fittings too . __eou__ yes , everything has been well designed .
so , tell me about you new house . how is it different to your old one ? __eou__ well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . it has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . we also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! __eou__ so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? __eou__ yes . one bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . my wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but i ’ d like to make it into a study . our daughter is also keen on making it a study , so that ’ s probably what will happen . __eou__ what ’ s the kitchen like ? i know both you and your wife like to cook . __eou__ that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . the kitchen and dining room are together . it ’ s really large . __eou__ are the rooms nice and bright ? __eou__ yes , they are . that ’ s very important to us . we like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . each room has large windows . __eou__ do you have a balcony ? __eou__ no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . that ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . the area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . __eou__ you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? there can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . is it easy to get into city centre ? __eou__ it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . there ’ s some traffic , but not much . it ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . so when are you going to drop by ?
i don't know how to adjust my life . would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__ you look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__ yes , i can't sleep well every night . __eou__ you should get plenty of sleep . __eou__ i drink a lot of wine . __eou__ if i were you , i wouldn't drink too much . __eou__ i often feel so tired . __eou__ you better do some exercise every morning . __eou__ i sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__ why do you worry about your future ? you're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . i hope you take my advice .
can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? __eou__ sure . if you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . it ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . __eou__ i need to excise my arms too . how can i do that ? __eou__ one good way is to do push-ups . another way is to use weights . make sure you grip the weights firmly . you don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! __eou__ when i do push-ups , should i bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? __eou__ you don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . the most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . __eou__ what ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? __eou__ one that i recommend is that you lie on your back . you should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body . __eou__ so i need plenty of space for this exercise . __eou__ yes , you do . lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . __eou__ great . thanks for you advice !
mum , can i finish my homework later ? __eou__ sorry . you know the rules . __eou__ but i want to watch tv now . __eou__ that ’ s out of the question . __eou__ please . __eou__ not a chance . __eou__ not even for an hour ? __eou__ sorry , it ’ s impossible .
i can ’ t find my purse . have you seen it ? __eou__ no , i haven ’ t . __eou__ i ’ ve looked everywhere for it . i must have left it somewhere . i hope i haven ’ t lost it . __eou__ perhaps you left that at school . __eou__ no , i had it when i left school this afternoon . __eou__ well . didn ’ t you go around to the smith after school ? you might have left it there . __eou__ yes , i ’ d better give her a call now . __eou__ but she can ’ t be home now . she might have gone to the library . __eou__ perhaps i should call her later .
let ’ s play a little game . i ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is . __eou__ ok . i ’ m really bored at the moment . __eou__ ok . this man is tall and slim . he ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair . __eou__ does he have a moustache or a beard ? __eou__ good question . yes , he has a moustache , but no beard . __eou__ sounds like mike , is it ? __eou__ yes , it is . you describe someone we both know . __eou__ right . she ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . she ’ s got blonder hair , but i don ’ t know what color her eyes are . __eou__ is she attractive ? i don ’ t think i know anyone like that . __eou__ well , i don't find her attractive , but i'm sure you will disagree . __eou__ i like slim girls , so i doubt i would find a plump girl attractive . you ’ ll have to give me some more information . __eou__ she ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . in fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too . __eou__ this doesn ’ t sound like anyone i know . i give up . teel me who she is . __eou__ she ’ s your mother ! __eou__ how embarrassing ! i don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! how important do you think appearance is ? __eou__ i think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . i think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . __eou__ i ’ m afraid you ’ re right . i chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality . __eou__ well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! hey , i was joking ! don ’ t hit me !

where are you going , jane ? __eou__ i'm going to the hospital to see susan . __eou__ i saw her yesterday . she was a little better . __eou__ must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ? __eou__ no , you needn't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . __eou__ number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? __eou__ yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said i had taken a wrong bus . __eou__ thank you , henry . i'll get a number 13 . __eou__ but number 13 buses leave from the center of town . you'll have to walk two miles to catch one .

can you help me find a pan ? __eou__ are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ? __eou__ i want a big pan . __eou__ does this one look big enough ? __eou__ yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much . __eou__ well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ? __eou__ it's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking . __eou__ here's the same pan , but it has a space-age , heat-resistant plastic handle . __eou__ oh , my family's going to love this one . i'll take it . __eou__ i'm so happy that you found what you wanted . do you want to use a credit card ? __eou__ sure . wait , wait . does a lid come with this pan ? __eou__ oh , i'm sorry . here's the lid . yes , it comes with the pan .

good afternoon , sir , is there anything i can help you with today ? __eou__ umm ... yeah ! i ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . our fifth anniversary ’ s next friday . __eou__ well , i would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . is there anything particular that you have in mind ? __eou__ no , not really ... i ’ m completely at a loss . __eou__ well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . what is her favorite gemstone ? __eou__ that purple one . i ’ m sorry ... i ’ ve never bought jewellery for anyone and i ’ m kind of nervous . __eou__ don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . that stone is an amethyst . we have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . take a look at this bracelet . it ’ s 18k rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . it ’ s a great statement piece . __eou__ oh ... wow . that ’ s really pretty.jess would love that . but ... i was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? __eou__ we have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . you could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.if you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe i can help you find something for her . __eou__ jess ? well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . she ’ s very feminine ... __eou__ perhaps you could give her a ring ? __eou__ well ... actually ... i was thinking about asking jess to marry me ... i ’ ve just been so nervous . __eou__ well sir , i believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! __eou__ okay , i ’ ve decided . i ’ m going to pop the question ! __eou__ fabulous ! we should look at engagement rings then ! now that ’ s a whole other section .
i want to go try on these clothes . __eou__ what did you find ? __eou__ i found some jeans , and a new blouse . __eou__ go and try it on . __eou__ what do you think ? __eou__ i love that shirt on you . __eou__ what about the jeans ? __eou__ they don't really fit you right . __eou__ i don't think so either . __eou__ that blouse is absolutely wonderful on you . __eou__ i'll just buy the shirt . __eou__ that would be a good idea .
mom , i'm ready for school . __eou__ let me feel your forehead . i'm so glad it wasn't strep throat . __eou__ i don't have a fever , and i'm ready for my test . __eou__ but i'm not sure you're strong enough yet . here's some seafood rice soup i made . it's delicious . __eou__ i'm fine , mom . i feel so much better . i want to go to school . i'm missing out on all the fun . __eou__ but the last two days were a weekend . __eou__ let me go to school , please ! i'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick !
how can i help you today ? __eou__ i am returning something that i bought yesterday . __eou__ what would you like to return ? __eou__ i'm returning a cellphone . __eou__ was there something wrong with it ? __eou__ it's defective . __eou__ what isn't working on it ? __eou__ it keeps turning off on it's own . __eou__ alright , do you have the receipt ? __eou__ i have it right here . __eou__ i'm going to take care of this and refund your money . __eou__ thanks for your help .
help me organize these coins . __eou__ that's a lot of money ! what did you do ? break the piggy bank ? __eou__ yeah , i'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills , but first i have to separate them into little piles . __eou__ ok , i'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies . __eou__ great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank . __eou__ i found some coins that are not from here . __eou__ oh yeah , those are from my trip to london . i have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound . __eou__ are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ? __eou__ hopefully !
can i borrow five bucks ? __eou__ no ! __eou__ come on ! i'll pay you back on tuesday . __eou__ last time i lent you money , you never paid me back . __eou__ i promise if you lend me five dollars today , i will repay you in full next week . __eou__ ok , but i'm taking your skateboard as collateral . __eou__ fine ! i can't believe you don't trust me . __eou__ it's nothing personal , just business .
i know why mr . fro didn't like our ad idea ! he doesn't know the first thing about coffee . __eou__ true . i always see him drinking instant . __eou__ let's take him some of kitty's best and make the pitch again . __eou__ do you think that will be enough to make him have a change of heart ? __eou__ it's worth a shot .
johnny , i want to thank you . __eou__ what do you mean , mom ? for breaking your best china ? __eou__ oh , johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . no , i want to thank you for keeping grandma busy . __eou__ well , it's more like she kept me busy ... __eou__ i know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . so , thank you . __eou__ am i back in your good books ? __eou__ not only that , but i'm going to buy you that video game after all !
look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning . __eou__ no , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . careful , hold it by the java jacket . this coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ? __eou__ it tastes funny . why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ? __eou__ that's just the point ! purity is the essence of good coffee , right ?
i'm done . can i watch tv ? __eou__ here's some water . take these multi-vitamins and tylenol . __eou__ uh ! i can't swallow them , mom ! __eou__ your throat must be swollen . __eou__ do i have to take them ? __eou__ here , i'll break them up , so they're smaller . and here's some cough syrup . __eou__ yuck ! __eou__ i know , it tastes horrible . but it'll make you feel better . try holding your nose . it won't taste as bad .
i am currently the highest bidder for your shirt . i was wondering about the size . __eou__ it's a small . __eou__ how is the condition ? how old is it ? __eou__ it has never been worn . it was too small for me so i'm selling it . __eou__ why didn't you return the shirt or exchange it ? __eou__ i got it as a gift so i couldn't take it back . good luck ! i hope it will fit you !
mom ! __eou__ what are you doing ? __eou__ i'm playing with my new jump rope ! watch this ! __eou__ you are sick , young lady . get back in bed ! i called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! __eou__ but i feel better . __eou__ then maybe you should go to school . if you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that english test , right ? __eou__ ok . i get it . i'm getting back into bed ...
guess what , gilly ? i won both bids . __eou__ good for you . did you use paypal ? __eou__ yeah . it was so easy and super-fast , once i figured it out . __eou__ that's the beauty of it , and the danger . __eou__ i should get the items within a week . but in the meantime i'm bidding on a digital video camera . __eou__ how much ? __eou__ thirty u . s . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months . __eou__ mmmm , sounds like risky business . good luck .
ouch ! the water's too hot ! __eou__ get in slowly , sweetie . you'll get used to it . i'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup . __eou__ i'm not hungry , mom . __eou__ i know you don't have an appetite , but you need to eat something . you'll get too weak if you don't eat . __eou__ oh ... i'm sweating already . it's so hot . i can feel it boiling ! can i get out yet ? __eou__ that's a good sign . but just soak a little longer , ok ?
hello , mr . gao . we appreciate your letting us have the apartment . __eou__ my pleasure . you're a sweet couple . do you have any questions ? __eou__ the ad said rent was thirty thousand . that includes utilities and phone , i assume . __eou__ no , it doesn't . and there's a maintenance fee for each month . it's forty nt per ping . __eou__ that's another one thousand six hundred ? __eou__ yes , but that doesn't include cable . it's for cleaning and trash removal . you just leave your trash outside your door .
you bet it is . and we got four thousand for our car space ! awesome ! __eou__ let's play some music ! i feel like dancing . __eou__ that's just what was running through my mind . moonlight and dancing . __eou__ ahh ! now that's more like it . atmosphere ! __eou__ come on baby , let's dance ! __eou__ oops ! it's the landlord . i guess the tables have turned now . we're the noisy neighbors . turn it down !
sorry to bother you so early . there's another couple who wants to rent the apartment , but i thought i'd ask you first . __eou__ that's so sweet of you . we definitely want it . __eou__ i thought so , by the looks on your faces when you left . so why don't you come to my apartment , and we'll settle all the details . __eou__ ok . how does seven o'clock this evening sound ? __eou__ great . see you then .
my latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month . __eou__ and this espresso looks like ... oil ! __eou__ it still tastes fine , though . __eou__ these days , i can't think of anything but motor oil . even coffee makes me think of it . __eou__ wait a second ! there's the idea for this case ! “ your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ”
so how long do you plan to live here ? __eou__ we'd like to sign a year-long contract , if that's ok . __eou__ fine by me . do you know how to read this kind of contract ? __eou__ yes . we've signed them before . we even brought our chops . __eou__ great . when in rome , you guys know what to do . __eou__ we'll sign our signatures , too . and give you our passport numbers along with our arc numbers . __eou__ that about does it . see you in a week .
that's really convenient . we were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . __eou__ i can take two thousand off . that'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . __eou__ that's great . every little bit counts . and we don't need the parking space . i guess we could rent it out . __eou__ sure , for at least three thousand per month . __eou__ that'll bring the price down to twenty-five . that's the price we were shooting for . __eou__ i'm glad . now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
ann , stop bugging jess and help me order something new . lattes are so passe these days . __eou__ why don't you try an americano ? espresso with water . __eou__ sounds a little weak . __eou__ go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee . __eou__ sounds better , but i hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head . __eou__ don't worry , james . we'll get this case worked out in no time .
any new ideas on the mr . fro case ? how can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ? __eou__ let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again . __eou__ i could use one , too . i'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign . __eou__ as long as the foam on my macchiato's not burnt , too , i'll be alright for a while . you got your espresso , jess ?
balista , i'll have a frappuccino . __eou__ what a girly drink . i'll take a bag of the blue mountain and a decaf breva ... __eou__ you and your fancy italian names . __eou__ isn't “ frappuccino ” italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini . __eou__ i'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much . __eou__ and i'll stick with real coffee .
this motor oil case is still really slippery . __eou__ yeah , time for more coffee ! __eou__ sure , why not ? i think i want a chocolate chip cookie , too . __eou__ by the way , i heard kitty's just got in a shipment of jamaican blue mountain . __eou__ so what ? __eou__ it's only the rarest coffee in the world ! didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ?
then i'll have to borrow it . __eou__ sure you can . but i'm only gonna keep it for a month . __eou__ why ? it's in mint condition ! __eou__ that's why i can profit from it ! __eou__ you're going to re-sell it on ebay taiwan ? __eou__ you bet . ebay taiwan doesn't have it ! and bidding will start at two thousand nt . this baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ... __eou__ i've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me !
this is a very spacious apartment . it's forty pings , including the parking space . that's about one thousand four hundred square feet . __eou__ wow . it's just the two of us . i don't know if we need that much room . __eou__ you never know when two might turn into three . __eou__ i guess you're right . and we'd like to have company anyway . __eou__ exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . and look , there are two bathrooms . __eou__ now that's a plus !
oh , well . it was fun to be the winner . but ... it's too big . i must be an extra small in the states . __eou__ so what about the tennis racket ? __eou__ look ! it's amazing . i can't wait to try it out ! __eou__ how much did that end up costing you ? __eou__ oh ... around twenty bucks . a bargain if you ask me . look at the picture of her playing with it ! __eou__ hey , two for one . that's a super deal . __eou__ and here's her signature !
so the apartment comes unfurnished ? __eou__ this one is . i have another one that's furnished , but i'm not sure you'll like the furniture . __eou__ we have tons of furniture . what we need are air conditioners . __eou__ this building is only four years old . it was built with central air . __eou__ just like in the states ! that's perfect ! __eou__ and i recently bought an american-style washer and dryer . come and see .
i'm in heaven ! a whirlpool dryer ! __eou__ i love them , too . let's move into the kitchen . wait until you see the refrigerator . __eou__ this is too good to be true . __eou__ and the stove is brand new . you know how to use a gas stove , right ? __eou__ yes . we've lived in taiwan for a while . i had a gas stove in the states , too . __eou__ it's better for cooking chinese food . well , what do you think ? __eou__ we love it . but we'd like to know about the neighbors .
they're here ! now that's speedy service ! and they arrived within two days of each other ! __eou__ what are you waiting for ? rip ‘ em open ! __eou__ wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big . __eou__ it's nice , but how much did you end up paying ? __eou__ with the shipping included--seventy dollars . __eou__ hmm ... not so hot . they sell them here for about that .
but this place doesn't feel like a forty-ping apartment . __eou__ well , it's forty pings including the balcony . see . it's huge . __eou__ oh ! the view is great ! mountains , fresh air ! stars ? __eou__ this balcony is perfect for barbecuing . __eou__ and we could get a dog ! __eou__ i'm sorry . no pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish . __eou__ well , fish it will be then .
great . my favorite-soup , soup , soup ... __eou__ oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets . __eou__ blow my nose ? __eou__ well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . i was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster . __eou__ no , please , mom ! don't make me gargle with saltwater ! __eou__ it works better than any medicine , lily . i'll make you a glass right now , and you'll finish it !
see ? that wasn't so bad . __eou__ easy for you to say . my bottom still stings . __eou__ it might be sore for a while . you'll be ok . now let's go home and rest . __eou__ can't we go to mcdonald's first ? __eou__ no , sweetie . i'll make you some tomato soup and rice . __eou__ no , thanks . __eou__ and vegetables with porridge . __eou__ blah ... what's that ? __eou__ this is all your medicine . you need to take it four times a day for three days straight .
oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ your upstairs neighbors live in canada and rarely come back to taiwan . when they do , they're never home . __eou__ and the downstairs neighbors ? __eou__ two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . when they're here , they're usually sleeping . and next door to you is me . i'm a quiet neighbor . __eou__ sounds ideal . we'll get back to you in a couple of days then .
morning , mom . __eou__ i made a doctor's appointment for you . __eou__ no , i'm fine . i don't need to see a doctor . __eou__ then i guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school . __eou__ ok . i'll go see the doctor . __eou__ bundle up . it's wet and rainy out there . here's some soup . __eou__ chicken soup again ? __eou__ soup does the body good , sweetie . it's what you need when you're under the weather .
come to think of it , you should get out your english books and catch up on your reading assignments . __eou__ but i don't have any reading assignments . __eou__ then review for your test . you'll do even better . and maybe reading will help you get to sleep . __eou__ aw , mom-you're such a drag . __eou__ you say that now , lily , but you'll thank me later . i'm your mom , and mother knows best .
this is awful ! it's like drinking saltwater ! it's like drowning in the ocean ! __eou__ don't be so dramatic . you're such a baby . now sit down and finish your soup . __eou__ ok , ok . __eou__ and when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again . __eou__ maybe i'll run away first . __eou__ well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine !
johnny , are you just sitting around again ? __eou__ i'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . __eou__ i'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . disgraceful ! __eou__ i'm doing my best , grandma ... __eou__ your best isn't good enough . back in my day , i'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! __eou__ uh-oh , here we go ...
johnny , i can't believe you would do that . __eou__ i know , grandma , i just ... __eou__ you're darn toomin ' , you know ! now , you're on housework duty while i'm here ! __eou__ yes'm . __eou__ you're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it ! __eou__ yes'm . __eou__ and you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house ! __eou__ yes'm .
steve , thanks for looking after johnny . __eou__ it was a pleasure , mrs . robinson . __eou__ and this kitchen is so clean . did you help johnny with that ? __eou__ i helped break ... i mean wash ... all the dishes ! __eou__ that's great . and the garbage , too ? __eou__ yeah , uh , it's outside . listen , i really have to be going now . __eou__ thanks for your help !
i think i found my yankee's mug ... __eou__ oh , great . where was it ? __eou__ it fell out of the garbage bag . __eou__ what was it doing there ? __eou__ it was with all the other dishes from dinner . __eou__ you mean johnny threw out all the dinnerware ? __eou__ i think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us .
can you fix me a cup of tea , johnny ? __eou__ well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ? __eou__ no . i'd like tea . can you put it in my favorite cup ? you probably washed it ... __eou__ oh , yeah . well , uh , about your mug ... __eou__ i'll find it ... where are all the floral pattern plates ? and dad's yankee's mug ?
grand theft auto three is awesome ! __eou__ it's more violent than tv news ! __eou__ what time is it anyway ? __eou__ nine-thirty . __eou__ oh , my god , three hours already ! i have to get the chores done ! __eou__ no time . that's their headlights in the window ! __eou__ ok , emergency measures . let's throw the dishes in the trash ! two birds with one stone ... __eou__ little dude , your life is over ! __eou__ no time to worry . we have to dispose of this evidence .
well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma . __eou__ yes , i hear about it every time she comes here . __eou__ she was the head janitor at st . mary's hospital for thirty years , after all . __eou__ i think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us . __eou__ you know , maybe she's just a neat freak . __eou__ i think she just likes to make us miserable . __eou__ you could be right .
so can we play playstation later ? __eou__ sure , if you're done ! __eou__ all my games are so lame , mom . when can i get a new one ? __eou__ well , listen , honey , you've been a big help lately ... __eou__ right on . i'm gonna get a new game ! __eou__ if you take out the garbage and do the dishes , i'll think about it . __eou__ i knew there would be a catch ! __eou__ nothing in life is free , son . __eou__ except housework , that is .
so where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ? __eou__ it ' s an indian restaurant ! i know you have never had indian food , so i thought you might want to try . __eou__ that sounds great ! i am craving some type of beef dish . __eou__ well , indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . you see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the hindu religion , so beef is not eaten . __eou__ i see , so what are we having ? chicken ? __eou__ there are many amazing dishes to choose from . we can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . it ' s a bit spicy , but i think you can handle it . __eou__ sounds good ! i have always heard that indian spices give a rich flavor to food . __eou__ yeah . also , we can have some naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . __eou__ what about veggies ? __eou__ they have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . __eou__ it all sounds exquisite ! i can ' t wait !
egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! __eou__ helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? what's wrong ? __eou__ i just can't stand it . it's really gross in here ! there ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . so i cleaned it ! __eou__ you did what ? helen , i know it's gross , but i ' ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? __eou__ i can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! __eou__ helen , this is not like your own bathroom . just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? __eou__ hang on . i'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . __eou__ you're such a neat freak ! i'm outta here !
hey , susan . have you got a sec ? i have some questions about my paycheck . __eou__ you bet , emily . pull up a chair . __eou__ well , this is my first paycheck here in the states and there are a few things i don't understand . first of all , what is this fica , and sui y tax , and why are there deductions both for medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ ok , let's start from the top of your pay stub . this number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ then here we have a series of deductions . first off are the federal ones . fica stands for federal insurance contribution act , or something like that . it's your federal income tax . and then there's social security and medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ all right , i see . so the medicare isn't actually a health insurance i can use now . __eou__ that's right . below the federal deductions are the state deductions . there's the state income tax , and then this sui / sdi tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ yeah , i don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . so there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ that's right . not all states have an income tax . some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ i see . all right , well i think everything else i can figure out on my own . the deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( k ) are pretty self-explanatory . thanks for your help , susan . __eou__ no problem ! all those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . i can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ yeah , i guess it's the same in the uk , i just never paid much attention . see you later !
hello sir , welcome to pistolera restaurant . may i take your order ? __eou__ yes , i would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole . __eou__ i ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . may i suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos . __eou__ sure i ' ll have the burrito . do you have nachos ? __eou__ of course sir . our nachos come with melted cheese and chili . __eou__ sounds good . __eou__ would you like anything to drink ? __eou__ sure , i ' ll have a corona .
hi , i would like to return this tv . __eou__ sure , do you have the receipt ? __eou__ yeah here you go . actually i also want to return this keyboard . __eou__ ok . may i ask what is the reason for returning these products ? __eou__ the tv flickers a lot when i am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear . __eou__ i see , and what about the keyboard ? __eou__ i spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work . __eou__ i am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages . __eou__ fine ! i don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
hey , trev ! how did the shopping go ? __eou__ “ you ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ” __eou__ trev , are you ok ? __eou__ of course i'm ok ! i just bought a bunch of classic elvis records ! __eou__ aren't you lucky . the vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . so i have nothing . __eou__ no sweat . just go back and talk him down . here comes wei .
hey julie , you want to go grab something to eat ? __eou__ sure ! what do you feel like having ? __eou__ i really feel like having a big juicy steak ! __eou__ oh . ok . i don't eat meat , but that's fine , i am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? __eou__ i didn't know you were a vegetarian ! __eou__ i'm not , i am a vegan . __eou__ a what ? __eou__ a vegan . i don't eat or use any animal based products . i don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . __eou__ wow ! that's interesting ! it must be tough ! __eou__ it's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
i found it at a garage sale once . __eou__ what a find ! so , how much does it cost ? __eou__ well , because i like you ... ninety bucks . __eou__ ninety dollars is pretty steep . i'll take it for sixty bucks . __eou__ sixty bucks ? no-can-do , son . you'll be lucky if i go down to eighty-five . __eou__ eighty-five ? that's the best you can do ? i'll come back later ...
johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ? __eou__ not yet , mom . why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ? __eou__ do i have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? __eou__ oh , my god , i forgot grandma's coming ! __eou__ yes , so this place had better be clean . you know grandma ... __eou__ ... i know i'll be killed if i pee on the toilet seat . __eou__ and steve is going to look after you until we come back .
do you like that vintage clock ? it's almost fifty years old . __eou__ really ? it almost looks brand new . and the color designs are so retro . __eou__ well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint . __eou__ no way ! my parents used to hang out at those places . __eou__ this is one of my favorite items . __eou__ how did you get it ?
how much for these autographed elvis records ? __eou__ thirty bucks a record . or five for one hundred and twenty bucks . __eou__ uh , i'm not sure . are these all in good condition ? __eou__ absolutely . i bought them from the king's estate myself ! tell you what-i'll let you have five for one hundred bucks . __eou__ i don't really need five . __eou__ ok . five for eighty-five bucks . that's my final offer . __eou__ oh , why not ? i'll take ' em .
hello . do you like this jewelry ? i made most of these items myself . __eou__ you really have talent . how did you learn to do this ? __eou__ my mother taught me some tricks of the trade . i've always loved jewelry . __eou__ me , too . but i could never make bracelets like these . __eou__ i've been making these designs for over ten years . you can have a bracelet for ten dollars . __eou__ i'll take one right now for seven dollars . __eou__ it's a deal !
why didn't you text me last night ? __eou__ what ? i sent you three or four messages ! __eou__ i didn't get any of them . i was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and i never got your message . __eou__ why didn't you just call ? i hate sending sms messages . __eou__ well , because i didn't have any credit on my phone . i used it all up this month . __eou__ i thought you had an unlimited sms plan ? __eou__ i do , but if i don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . __eou__ no wonder you didn't get my texts !
bruno bistro , how may i help you ? __eou__ yes , hello , i would like to make a reservation please . __eou__ certainly sir , for which day and time please ? __eou__ tonight at seven . __eou__ i'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight . __eou__ in that case , eight o'clock is fine . __eou__ very well , and how many people will attend tonight ? __eou__ four people . __eou__ lastly , may i please know what name i should make the reservation under ? __eou__ mark .
i'm hungry , let's order up something to eat . __eou__ ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street . __eou__ i was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae . __eou__ you eat too much junk food . that sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol . __eou__ well i never seem to gain weight so i don't mind . __eou__ it's not only about getting fat or not , it's about being healthy . you could really have some health problems later on . __eou__ how about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! better yet , let's order some hot dogs ! __eou__ you are a lost cause .
ok , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? __eou__ almost , let me just put my apron on . __eou__ ok , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees fahrenheit . __eou__ got it . __eou__ no we are gonna make the batter . take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . __eou__ do i have to use a whisk or can i use the electric mixer ? __eou__ go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . i'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . __eou__ ok , so now we need a baking pan right ? __eou__ yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . __eou__ done . so how long do we bake it for ? __eou__ we can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . __eou__ wow ! this was a lot easier than i thought !
hey honey ! where were you ? __eou__ i decided to take kenny to the park and get some fresh air . __eou__ how was it ? were there a lot of kids ? __eou__ it wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! we got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then i tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but i didn't fit . __eou__ sounds like fun ! when we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox . __eou__ yeah , but today he was really hyper . he even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . i'm exhausted ! __eou__ you should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore !
what's for dinner ? __eou__ leftovers . __eou__ what ? leftovers of what and from when ? __eou__ from last night ! i took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! __eou__ isn't that dangerous though ? i mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ? __eou__ well , i didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and i refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . also , when reheating , i put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees celsius . __eou__ well ok , i am just afraid of getting food poisoning . __eou__ don't worry about it ! making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat !
thank you for coming tonight , mrs . webber . as a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . __eou__ of course ! i am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve . __eou__ well allen is a great student . he is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math . __eou__ i guess he gets that from me , i never did well in math when i was a kid . what can i do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom . __eou__ well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . i would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . it will really help a lot . __eou__ thanks a lot ! i will definitely do that . is there anything else ? __eou__ um ... yes . here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's tumion is overdue . __eou__ oh yes , i ...
welcome to al's bakery . what can i get you ? __eou__ hi ! let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread . __eou__ sure . would you like to have the loaf sliced ? __eou__ no , that's ok . do you have any whole wheat bread ? __eou__ we are out at the moment . may i suggest some rye bread ? __eou__ sure that sounds good . do you have any cakes ? __eou__ we have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes . __eou__ i'll just take a cheesecake . __eou__ will that be all ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .
can you help me set up my voicemail message ? i just got this service and i am not really sure what i am supposed to say . __eou__ sure ! you just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back . __eou__ ok , so can i say , " this is abby's voicemail . i will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . __eou__ that's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . __eou__ ok , so how about this , " this is abby and i am really happy you called ! i promise i will give you a ring as soon as i can , so please leave me your name and number . talk to you soon ! " . __eou__ a little too friendly abby . just say this , " hi , you have reached abby . i am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , i will get back to you as soon as possible . thanks " . __eou__ that's perfect ! can you say that again and record it for me ?
look , jimmy's report came today . __eou__ let's have a look . what is this ? where are all the grades ? __eou__ he's in the third grade sam ! you see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . a one means his achievement or work is excellent . here in science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory . __eou__ what about here in physical education ? __eou__ he got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . we should work on that with him . __eou__ so confusing ! in my day we got an a or b if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an f !
what did you cook ? __eou__ well , as you know i was in thailand last month , and i took a cooking class ! so i prepared some of my favorite dishes . __eou__ great idea ! as long as i don't get food poisoning ! so what is on the menu tonight ? __eou__ ok , for starters we have tom yam soup . it's a bit spicy , but really good ! __eou__ this is delicious ! the ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! __eou__ now this next dish is one of the most famous . foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is tom sam . it is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . __eou__ this is delicious ! the combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! i could have this everyday ! __eou__ ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . this is called pad thai . it's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . it's practically thailand's national dish ! __eou__ wow , this is great ! i never knew thai food was so creative and delicious ! __eou__ want some more ? __eou__ i'm stuffed !
what are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ my brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me . __eou__ is it a family thing or just friends ? __eou__ a bit of both . some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood . __eou__ is your great uncle rick going to be there ? he is really funny . __eou__ yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife . __eou__ you mean your sister ? __eou__ no , rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother . __eou__ you lost me . __eou__ i'll explain later , let's go .
hello mrs parker , how have you been ? __eou__ hello dr peters . just fine thank you . ricky and i are here for his vaccines . __eou__ very well . let's see , according to his vaccination record , ricky has received his polio , tetanus and hepatitis b shots . he is 14 months old , so he is due for hepatitis a , chickenpox and measles shots . __eou__ what about rubella and mumps ? __eou__ well , i can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks i can administer the rest . __eou__ ok , great . doctor , i think i also may need a tetanus booster . last time i got it was maybe fifteen years ago ! __eou__ we will check our records and i'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . now , please hold ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little .
have you seen this news article ? apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . __eou__ wow , that's really interesting . so who won ? __eou__ well , the great wall of china , the taj mahal in india . __eou__ i've been there ! it really is an amazing work of architecture and art . the entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! __eou__ cool ! also amongst the winners is petra , in jordan , mach pitch in peru and the pyramid in chichenitza in mexico . __eou__ wait a minute ! it also says that the christ re-deemer statue in brazil and the colosseum in rome are wonders . i would love to go to italy and see the colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! __eou__ well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . __eou__ good idea !
i think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . __eou__ what ? why ? __eou__ well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . i have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . __eou__ like what ? i think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . __eou__ well , first of all , i would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . i also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses . __eou__ i think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea . __eou__ i will bring it up over sunday brunch . __eou__ good luck with that !
good afternoon sir , may i please see your passport and reservation ? __eou__ here you go . __eou__ i'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems . __eou__ cancelled ! so what am i supposed to do now ? __eou__ we apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . if your flight is urgent , i can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight . __eou__ what's my other option ? __eou__ well , if you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning . __eou__ that's fine . i'll do that then . __eou__ thank you for your understanding sir . i will book your flight now .
what's wrong ? __eou__ i have a headache . these past few days i've been living off painkillers . man , i feel like my head is going to explode . __eou__ you should get acupuncture treatment . my mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__ the results are too slow . on top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . __eou__ they don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . the heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . __eou__ but i get scared the moment i see a needle . how could i stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__ the needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . however , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__ scraping is too terrifying . when they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . it looks like someone beat you up . __eou__ this only signifies that the toxins have left the body . actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__ chinese medicine is strange . the patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . __eou__ this is the only way to get at the problem . anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__ forget it . i don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . in a little while i'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .
hello there , welcome to wine world . let me know if i can help you out at all . __eou__ um , yes , please , i could really use some help . i'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine i should bring . __eou__ ok , do you know what kind of food will be served ? __eou__ well , his wife is japanese . he said she makes really good sushi . __eou__ hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . __eou__ why ? wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? __eou__ no , i don't think so . sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . you need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . __eou__ i see . so should i get a bottle of chardonnay ? that's a white wine , right ? __eou__ yes , chardonnay is a white wine , but i'm not sure it'd be your best bet . chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . i'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this sauvignon blanc from new zealand . __eou__ sauvignon blanc ? what's that ? __eou__ that's another varietal , or type of grape , just like chardonnay . __eou__ let's see . the label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . serve chilled . " oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? i'm on my way to the dinner now . __eou__ it's ok , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . we don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this rhone valley white would be lovely . __eou__ all right . what varietal is that ? __eou__ well , this is a french wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . the french believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . this wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly viognier , i'd guess . __eou__ and you think this is a good wine ? __eou__ yes , this is one of our best-sellers . it's not quite as dry as the sauvignon blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . it's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . __eou__ perfect ! i'll take it !
whoa ! this is a massive flea market ! __eou__ you're telling me ! there are thousands of people here . __eou__ and hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff . __eou__ this is almost like a taiwanese night market ! i can't believe it ! __eou__ you can't buy much more , wei ! you already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to taiwan . __eou__ oh , yeah . ok . i'll just buy smallthings !
you want to go get a facial with me today ? __eou__ dude , what are you talking about ? only girls do that . __eou__ not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . there is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good . __eou__ true . so what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? __eou__ well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . then i get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . __eou__ that doesn't really sound like something i would be interested in . in any case , i just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day . __eou__ well you should come with me one day , i'm sure you'll love it . __eou__ uh ... no .
wei ! this is a first-you didn't bargain ! __eou__ bargain ? i'd feel way too guilty . __eou__ but you could have saved money . __eou__ from a sweet ma ? ! it's not worth it . plus , i'd happily pay more for these things i bought ! __eou__ f . y . i . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ... __eou__ ha ! i'm just warming up ! please take me there now !
do you want to go catch a movie tonight ? __eou__ i can't , i have to go to the gym . __eou__ come on ! you can go tomorrow , just skip it today . it's not as if you are gonna get in trouble ! __eou__ actually i will ! i am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if i don't go . i like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy . __eou__ that's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ? __eou__ yeah . he makes a work put plan depending on the areas i want to work on , or the muscles i want to build . like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , i do leg lifts or squats . __eou__ sounds like you are really getting in shape !
of course ! of course ! here you are . thank you so much . __eou__ are you looking for anything else ? __eou__ um , let me see . hmm . this antique tea set here is gorgeous . __eou__ that was a thirtieth birthday present . you can have it if you want . __eou__ really ? no , no , i couldn't ! you're too nice ! __eou__ and these old dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set . have them . __eou__ gee ! i don't know what to say ! thanks so much .
good morning , young lady . you can call me ma . do you see anything you like ? __eou__ yes . many things ! i especially love this beautiful quilt . __eou__ that quilt was passed down to me from my ma in holland . __eou__ it sounds like a special quilt . why do you want to sell it ? __eou__ well , this home is too big for me now , so i'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . therefore , i need to part with a few things . __eou__ oh , i see . umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? __eou__ is fifteen dollars ok ?
ok . do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ? __eou__ can i get my hair done like his ? his girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white . __eou__ like that rastafarian over there ? you mean dreadlocks ? you crazy ! that'll take way too long . __eou__ what kind of style are you getting done ? can we match ? __eou__ i'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like halle . __eou__ can i get a relaxer , too ? and why did you say , “ you crazy ” instead of “ you ou're crazy ” ?
good evening ms . jackson . fancy meeting ’ you here . __eou__ hi , clyde . this is my friend , wen . she's visiting from ucla . __eou__ clyde smith . pleasure to meet you . may i treat you ladies to dinner ? __eou__ ok ! i was just tellin ’ wen about african-american food . __eou__ you weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? well , my creole ancestors never ate that stuff . we have refined french tastes . __eou__ hey ! that “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good !
how do i look ? i love these braids . they're fun ! __eou__ they look great ! hey , are you hungry ? i know a good ethiopian restaurant-meskerem . __eou__ an ethiopian restaurant ? whoa ! i always think of starving people in ethiopia . __eou__ it's very “ in ” these days . some of the places are really expensive . __eou__ that's so ironic ! well , what's it like ? is it your traditional food ? __eou__ no . africans and african-americans are different in many ways . our food's different , too .

welcome to our show ! today , i am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! are you ready ? let ’ s get started ! __eou__ let ’ s start with the basics , bread . bread is an important ingredient here . you need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . if you want a closed sandwich i recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but i ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . i would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . the best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . as for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , i would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . we can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! it ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ that ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! till next time !

i think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . what ’ s worse , i just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts i have been paying for . last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . you know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . i was just wondering about all these . __eou__ there are such shops living on selling parts . i don ’ t like their service either . all they want is your money . but in the long run , they will be losing costumers . anyway , car service business is new in china . we all have to control what they are doing . otherwise , they will not improve . __eou__ is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . __eou__ yes , there is . those organizations exist . you always can call a lawyer if you need legal help .

hey ! ask your mom for more old pictures , ok ? __eou__ can't it wait ? she's still angry that we sent e-mail wedding invitations . __eou__ but we saved your parents so much money ... __eou__ i know . and they're spending enough on the plane tickets to texas ! __eou__ speaking of plane tickets , don't forget to check on the reservations ! __eou__ ok .
what's in the box ? __eou__ sandy , i think we made a mistake ... __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ it's a cute little teddy bear ! __eou__ how sweet ! maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you ! __eou__ and look what we did to him ! hey ... he left me his business card . __eou__ wow ! call him tonight ! you guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone !

did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? __eou__ are you sure ? how do you know ? __eou__ well , usually people think i'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say i sound a lot better ! __eou__ well , i heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... __eou__ then after a few beers , you'll be singing in taiwanese ? __eou__ maybe ...

so your mom can stop nagging you now . __eou__ trust me . she'll keep nagging . she thinks something will go wrong . __eou__ don't tell me she's been listening to the fortune-teller again . __eou__ you guessed it . she says we have to get married on january 2nd , or we'll have bad luck . __eou__ the day we choose to get married could never be an unlucky day . __eou__ my mom just wants everything to be perfect for us .

hello again ! here's another fruit tray for you . __eou__ oh , hi again ! hey , the fruit looks different this time . __eou__ i make each one a little different . it's a way for me to express my creativity ! __eou__ it looks really artistic ! how did you learn to do that ? __eou__ oh , look at your table ! i'll help you clear it off . __eou__ you know , art is something i've always been interested in ... __eou__ enjoy your food ! bye !
taylor , you're looking a little pale . are you sure you want to hand out nametags ? __eou__ do i have a choice ? you said the guy who was supposed to do it didn't show . __eou__ true . keep up the good work . hello , welcome to the reunion of the class of ' 93 . __eou__ just come over here , sir . first you need to sign in and get your photo nametag . __eou__ and don't forget to put in an order for your reunion memory book . __eou__ would you like to donate to our alumni fund ?
did you like the chanel bag that i got ? __eou__ you must have a rich boyfriend because that bag is so expensive ! __eou__ i bought it on ebay . it was only one-tenth of the original price . and the purchase was so easy . __eou__ no kidding ! then how do you know the bag's real ? __eou__ well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . but auctioning on ebay is risky . __eou__ a risk i would never take ... __eou__ then you haven't browsed ebay before ... get online . don't hang up !
hit ' em high , hit ' em low . class of ' 93 — let's go ! __eou__ hi there , everyone . we hope you're having a good night ! __eou__ wasn't that football game great ! i just knew we'd win ! __eou__ the night is young , folks . get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday . __eou__ later we'll let you know who the king and queen of the reunion will be . __eou__ but for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . get out on that dance floor !

ten dollars ? maybe there are a lot of them ... __eou__ seven dollars ! ! ! incredible ! but i saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating . __eou__ was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ? __eou__ i read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! and i noticed that he won't ship abroad . __eou__ some people get nasty on those comments . maybe you should write him and ask nicely . __eou__ ok . wish me luck !
only one . but i wanted to make sure i'd get it . __eou__ yeah , i really wanted that chanel bag , too . but just in case you should bid low . __eou__ but there are only two more days until the bidding closes ! __eou__ i bid on a chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off ! __eou__ oh ... i'm such a newbie . but at least i'm sure i'll get that tennis racket . __eou__ don't count on it , babe . ebay is always full of surprises . __eou__ well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
so , got any more ideas for the website ? __eou__ well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , i made a " for guests only " gift chat room . __eou__ but we registered at macy's . people can just buy gifts there . __eou__ the taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in america . the chat room is more convenient . __eou__ you're right . they can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things . __eou__ or discuss what gifts they could buy together . __eou__ any other ideas ? __eou__ we can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments . __eou__ and we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... __eou__ yeah , that will be the best part . jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? __eou__ no . he has no idea what a fat little pig i was !
i decided to give it a go ! __eou__ good for you . what items did you bid on ? __eou__ a deny shirt and one of serena williams ' used tennis rackets ! __eou__ your idol ! wow ! you're even better at finding stuff than me ! __eou__ yep . i placed a bid for the shirt . the minimum was ten so i bet fifty ! __eou__ that's not how this game works . __eou__ well , there was a sign that said “ buy now for seventy . ” __eou__ how many bids had been placed before you ?
but what if i don't win what i bid on ? __eou__ then it wasn't meant to be . some people have put up a hard fight for some items i bid on . but i was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap . __eou__ it seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions . __eou__ sure . i've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag . __eou__ and people are honest ? __eou__ they said he was an honest and professional businessman . but that's the exciting part . it's kind of like gambling ...
i was wondering whether you could ship the tennis racket overseas to taiwan . __eou__ i'm sorry we don't ship overseas . it's too much trouble . __eou__ i understand you don't have a history of shipping overseas , but i am willing to pay extra for shipping . __eou__ maybe we could make an exception for you if you win the bid . __eou__ thanks so much ! by the way , is the racket really serena williams ’ ? __eou__ yes . you'll get a picture of serena playing with the racket and a document from her .
brooke , i have bad news . __eou__ what ! __eou__ i called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today . __eou__ don't you dare tell me that ... __eou__ i'm sorry . i didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats . __eou__ well , they should have called you ! __eou__ they said that they did . i've been so busy ... __eou__ and you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? __eou__ i didn't think there would be a problem . __eou__ it's the holidays ! everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets ! __eou__ i'm sorry . we're still going . i got reservations for all of us on the 31st . it will be ok . trust me . __eou__ trust you ! you can't even handle simple plane reservations ! __eou__ brooke !
ok . i just saw a versace for thirty dollars . this stuff can't be real ! __eou__ most of it is . you should sign up . __eou__ i'm not sure i'd want to give these people my credit card number . __eou__ didn't you read about paypal and bidpai ? they are very safe . __eou__ sure , but it's so complicated . they asked for my credit card authorization number . __eou__ that's the last three or four numbers on the back of your credit card where your signature is . __eou__ i have trouble understanding all these forms ... but i'm sure i'll get it .
merry christmas , sweetie . how's your brother enjoying taiwan ? __eou__ ryan says he wants to stay . i think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters ... __eou__ no ! christmas without him is bad enough . so , honey , do you have cold feet yet ? __eou__ yeah , especially since jack didn't take care of the plane reservations . __eou__ you're not coming ? __eou__ not until the 31st . so can you change the church reservations ? __eou__ i'm afraid not . the church is booked until the year 2001 . __eou__ then where will we have the ceremony ? at home ? __eou__ we'll have to . we'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd . __eou__ i'm sorry , mom . __eou__ don't worry , dear . i'm a great host . now get some rest . merry christmas . __eou__ merry christmas , mom . i love you . __eou__ i love you , too . and forgive jack . he's doing his best . __eou__ i know . goodnight .
how much are you planning to buy ? __eou__ well , it's not how much , but what i'm going to buy that matters . i'm going ski shopping ! __eou__ cool ! can i come ? __eou__ no . the front seat folds down all the way so there's just enough space for the skis ... __eou__ but not enough space for me ? __eou__ not unless you lose about 100 pounds ... __eou__ billy ...
what in the world is that smell ? __eou__ the aroma of roasting coffee beans . __eou__ smells like you're baking something . what are those ? __eou__ green beans . they pop and turn brown when you roast them . __eou__ cool ! but isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? __eou__ this machine roasts the beans just right . if you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ... __eou__ the beans will burn . i know . i've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck !
cute ... here . these beans are already ground . now for step three __eou__ so soon ? __eou__ you have to brew the grinds while they're fresh and drink it immediately for the best flavor . __eou__ ok ! hurry , then ! here's my cup . i can't wait for step four ! __eou__ there is no step four ... __eou__ yes , there is , drinking your coffee !
it's chinese new year ! that means it's time to eat hot pot ! __eou__ let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . __eou__ you mean half-and-half ? __eou__ yep . that way i can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . __eou__ good idea . __eou__ let's go !
this broth is wonderful . what's in it ? __eou__ lamb and beef . it will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! __eou__ hey ! watch out ! you're using the same spoon for both broths ! __eou__ so ? __eou__ you're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth ! __eou__ you'll be ok . it's just a little bit ...
wow ! your fruit looks really fresh ! how much are these apples ? __eou__ the apples are 30nt each . how many would you like ? __eou__ let's see , 30nt is about ... almost a dollar us . what ? ! how about these pineapples ? __eou__ they're 250nt each , but they're not edible . they're only used for worship . __eou__ hmm , 250nt is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! and you can't even eat them ? you're crazy ! __eou__ wait ! don't go just yet . these bananas are pretty cheap--only 35nt for this bunch . __eou__ now that's more like it ! bananas have lots of potassium , too ! __eou__ they're also good for your digestion ! would you like some kiwis , too ? __eou__ are they from taiwan ? __eou__ they're imported from new zealand . four for 50nt . nine for a hundred . __eou__ ok . i'll take four kiwis .
ok ... well , then how much is one jin ? __eou__ ginseng comes in 6 different grades . it runs from 5,000 to 30,000 nt a jin . __eou__ 30,000 nt for ginseng ? ! do i have to buy a whole jin ? __eou__ you can get a liang if you want . a liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . that would be 330nt . __eou__ whew ! that sounds more like my price range . i'll take two liangs . __eou__ i'll have my brother cut some for you . __eou__ this little red fruit looks good . what's it good for ? __eou__ that's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! people say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon ! __eou__ uh ... , i'm not even married yet . how about this brown dried fruit ? __eou__ gui yuan are lucky , too ! if you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life ! __eou__ and how about these little brown chips ? __eou__ oh , that's deer horn . that helps you ... umm , how should i put it ?

can i help you ? __eou__ i'm looking for an mp - 3 player . which brand is of the highest quality ? __eou__ i recommend pioneer . __eou__ which model is the best-seller ? __eou__ this model is very popular with ladies . __eou__ may i have a look at it ? __eou__ sure , it's multi-functional . besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings . __eou__ do you have this model in white ? __eou__ no , but we have it in yellow . __eou__ then i'll take the yellow one . __eou__ please wait a second . i'll get it for you . __eou__ okay .
what kind of car is best for me ? __eou__ for you , i would recommend this one here . __eou__ the compact ? why do you think that one is better than the others ? __eou__ this automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . i know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school . __eou__ that's true . what kind of safety features are we talking about ? __eou__ this model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . but that's not all . this car isn't only safe but it's also very economical . __eou__ you mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ? __eou__ yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . the main attraction for this model is the fuel economy . __eou__ with the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . i think this model may be just what i'm looking for . __eou__ why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over .
i think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . what ’ s worse , i just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts i have been paying for . last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . you know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . i was just wondering about all these . __eou__ there are such shops living on selling parts . i don ’ t like their service either . all they want is your money . but in the long run , they will be losing costumers . anyway , car service business is new in china . we all have to control what they are doing . otherwise , they will not improve . __eou__ is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . __eou__ yes , there is . those organizations exist . you always can call a lawyer if you need legal help .
excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the wudaokou subway station from here ? __eou__ sure ... first you're going to have to buy a ticket to ride on the subway . the wudaokou station is on the lightrail , so you'll have to transfer . be sure you buy a combination ticket for the regular subway and the lightrail . it should cost you 5 yuan . __eou__ an after i buy the ticket , where should i go ? __eou__ you can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at fuxingmen transfer station . after you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards fuchengmen . __eou__ so i transfer from red to blue , then how long do i ride the blue ? __eou__ you'll take the blue line until you reach xizhimen . that's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . you can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system . __eou__ it sounds so complicated ! __eou__ no , not the really , don't worry about it , like i said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , there's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . head north on the yellow line , and you'll see wudaokou in just a couple of stops .

the air conditioning is not working ! we need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! __eou__ dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . __eou__ that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it ’ s really annoying ! __eou__ yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__ i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
want to send out for some chinese ? __eou__ some what ? __eou__ some chinese food . i ’ m hungry , and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here . we can have them deliver and then watch the news on tv while we eat . __eou__ no , i ’ d rather go out . the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home . maybe we can try some other food today ... what about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? __eou__ okay . i could go for that . it ’ s called al ’ s steakhouse . they also have great fried fish , and i love their salad bar . you can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like . __eou__ is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? __eou__ yes , their steaks are enormous . sometimes i can ’ t finish what i ’ ve ordered . __eou__ what if that happens to me ? i hate to let food go to waste . __eou__ don ’ t worry . we ’ ll just get a doggie bag .

it's my first visit to prague , i'll be here for three days for a conference , then i have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before i head back home . what do you suggest i see when i'm here ? __eou__ there are many interesting places you should be sure to see . one problem is transportation , however . because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . if you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . i suggest you take the subway . __eou__ the subway ? but is there a subway station next to my hotel ? i have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... __eou__ no worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . when you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . __eou__ is it expensive to ride on the underground ? __eou__ you can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . __eou__ is it easy to get lost ? __eou__ no , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . there are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . if you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way .
so how ’ s everything going for christmas ? __eou__ i ’ ve got all the presents i need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . that ’ s easy ; but i have another problem to deal with . __eou__ what ’ s that ? don ’ t tell me you ’ ve still got christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours . __eou__ no , i did that a long time ago . it ’ s about telling my son the truth about santa claus . __eou__ he still doesn ’ t know that santa isn ’ t real ? how old is he , eight ? __eou__ yes . he ’ s never said anything so i never told him . but now that he ’ s getting older ... __eou__ you think it ’ s better that he should be told ? __eou__ yes , he ’ s too old to believe in that type of things . and i ’ d rather tell him before the kids at school do . __eou__ that happened to my oldest girl . she became really upset when her classmates told her santa wasn ’ t real . __eou__ i can understand . i was lucky with my oldest ; she figured it out by herself and didn ’ t tell my son . __eou__ well , when you tell him , be gentle . it ’ s hard for kids to find out something like that .
ok , honey , time to take down the christmas tree . __eou__ do we have to ? __eou__ come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . __eou__ it ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . it gives the room a good atmosphere . __eou__ a good atmosphere ? the tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room . __eou__ but it makes the place feel so much like christmas . i ’ d really hate to have to take it down . __eou__ but christmas was two weeks ago ! it ’ s been there only because we ’ ve been too busy to get rid of it . __eou__ i know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . __eou__ but it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . __eou__ i know , i know . but it reminds me of the great christmas we just had . all of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . __eou__ yeah , it was a good christmas . it won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should . __eou__ ok , fine . we need to take down the tree . __eou__ i ’ ll make a deal with you . we ’ ll leave it up until sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church .

paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . so , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ? __eou__ i know mark is your only child . you may do it differently from what i did . sometimes i would tap their hands when they made troubles . __eou__ i do it , too . you know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . and if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . he does it very often . i really get mad . i can ’ t help spank him sometimes . __eou__ and what does your husband do ? __eou__ my husband is an american . he criticizes me when i do that . he says that i can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . he is learning what i am doing now . __eou__ but spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! you ’ ve got to have patience with him and teach him . it ’ s not easy , i know . it ’ s hard . __eou__ yeah . i ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . my child is almost two years old , and i ’ ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something .

i'm calling to ask about your apartment you advertised . __eou__ yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery.and they are all newly renovated . __eou__ that sounds fantastic ! but i am looking for something closer to downtown , as i spend most of my time at the office . __eou__ no problem . we have a nice apartment located near the oriental square . it's perfect for people busy with office work . it is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . __eou__ i'm sure they are wonderful , but i need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . __eou__ ah ! i get your point . we have just what you need . our jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . the one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . i think you can find a very apartment there . __eou__ great ! i'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . could you tell me the detailed dress ? __eou__ of course . it's just at 19 lingual road . you can phone me again if you can't find the right place . __eou__ ok . thank you .

this is the house i want to rent . __eou__ could you tell me the advantages of it ? __eou__ no problem . first , it's comfortable and cozy . second , it has a lovely view of the city . third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . __eou__ there is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? __eou__ 200 dollars per week . __eou__ in my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . __eou__ it certainly is . but to tell you the truth , the room is so large that i can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . __eou__ your intention is good , but i still can't agree with you . if no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . __eou__ don't you think i can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where i work ? __eou__ i agree with you in this way . but how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? __eou__ twice a week for work and once for shopping . __eou__ in my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . __eou__ that's true . ok , i will think about it .
tommy played truant today . his teacher called me this morning . __eou__ where did he go ? __eou__ i've asked him , but he won't tell me . what should we do about this ? he is like you . i remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . __eou__ like me ? but you see i am so successful now . and if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . __eou__ stop , stop ... we are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . __eou__ pay him ? but he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . i got an idea . you should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . __eou__ in that way , i'll be late every day . how about letting him go to school on school bus ? __eou__ that's a good idea . why have i never thought of that ? __eou__ that's because i went to school for each class when i was at school . so now i am much more clever than you .
hello , anna speaking ! __eou__ hey , anna , this is jason . __eou__ jason , where have you been hiding lately ? you know it's been a long time since your last call . have you been good ? __eou__ yes . how are you , anna ? __eou__ i am fine . what have you been doing ? __eou__ working . i've been really busy these days . i got a promotion . __eou__ that's great , congratulations ! __eou__ thanks . i am feeling pretty good about myself too . you know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant . __eou__ that's good . so i guess i'll have to make an appointment to see you . __eou__ you are kidding . __eou__ how long have you been working there ? __eou__ a bit over two years . this is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions . __eou__ how do you like your new boss ? __eou__ she is very nice and open-minded . __eou__ much better than the last one , huh ? __eou__ yeah . he was a real slave driver . he probably would have loved it if we were robots . __eou__ forget about him . come over to my house tonight . let's get drunk . __eou__ good . tonight 8 o'clock . __eou__ 8 it is . see you then . __eou__ bye .
excuse me , could you help me ? __eou__ yes , what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ well . i was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport ? __eou__ i am afraid not . have you lost your passport ? __eou__ i think so . i can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and i remember the last place i used it yesterday was in this department store . __eou__ where exactly did you use your passport in the store ? __eou__ in the shoe department . i had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques . __eou__ well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ ve found a passport . sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either . __eou__ then what shall i do ? __eou__ you can fill in this lost property report and i will keep my eye out for it . these kinds of things usually turn up eventually , but i suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation , so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up . __eou__ you are right . do you have a pen ? __eou__ here you are . __eou__ oh , i seem to lose something every time i travel .
yes , emergency . there is a huge fire here . __eou__ calm down , sir . what's your name and where are you now ? __eou__ my name is jerry and we are on the intersection of west road and east road . __eou__ sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . our men will be over in 5 minutes .

how do i set up an e-mail account ? __eou__ oh , that's easy . go to www.onxiu.cn . now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope . __eou__ which link ? __eou__ that one , the one that says mail . __eou__ oh , no . what did i do ? it's asking me for a password . __eou__ don't worry . see where it says , new user ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ click on that . __eou__ oh , i see . __eou__ yeah , just fill out this form and choose a password . the computer will do the rest .

excuse me . i've been waiting here for 15 mins . do you know how often does no . 3 run ? __eou__ oh , it runs every 20 mins . you must have missed it , when you came here . it should be here any minute now . __eou__ it seems that you have got here at a good time . do you have a bus schedule ? __eou__ yes , i do . you can go to the transport department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map . __eou__ i see , thank you .
taxi . __eou__ get on , pls . where do you wanna go ? __eou__ thank you . pls hurry , i am late . can i get to the battery park before 4 ? __eou__ all right , miss . i think we will get there if there are no delays on the way . __eou__ how exactly do you figure out the car fare ? __eou__ according to the kilometer rate , the first five kilometers are 4 dollars and every kilometer extra costs 50 cents . __eou__ oh , i see . __eou__ here we are , miss . __eou__ thank you . how much do i owe you ? __eou__ you owe me 19 dollars . __eou__ that's 20 dollars . keep the change ! __eou__ thank you !

we need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on ? __eou__ why ? __eou__ well , i think we could be saving more . __eou__ really ? well . ok . get the receipts out . __eou__ let's see . we spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month . __eou__ that's 1,825 dollars . __eou__ we put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account . __eou__ 3,075 . our paychecks are 3300 combined . that means we don't have any receipts for 225 . __eou__ right .
where is my back pack ? __eou__ i don't know . where did you leave it ? __eou__ i just put it on the chair a while ago , but now it's gone . __eou__ are you sure ? __eou__ of course , i am sure . i bet someone stole it . __eou__ well , you should have kept an eye on it .

listen , karen , i need your help . i don't know anyone here yet . __eou__ i'm glad to help you . what's wrong ? __eou__ my mother-in-law just went into the hospital in l.a.hank and i will be flying there tonight . __eou__ i'm sorry to hear it . what's wrong with her ? __eou__ doctors aren't sure yet.but the real problem is suzy . she has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . but we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__ you need a babysitter . __eou__ yes , i'd ask jill , the girl i've had before , but i need someone overnight.maybe even for two nights . __eou__ i could have suzy stay at my place . __eou__ i don't want to do that to you , karen . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ your own kids would get suzy's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i don't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days . __eou__ i know who we can ask . there is a girl i know , sara ralston.she is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . i know her from my church , and i trust her completely . __eou__ i'd like to talk with her.this is short notice , i know . but hank and i are leaving tonight . __eou__ i'll get you her number . i hope she can do it . she is very responsible . __eou__ i'm glad you know someone . i knew you would be the best person to ask about this . i don't want to insult jill or her mother . i think jill maybe could do it.but i'd rather have someone a little older . __eou__ i'll go home and get sara's number . i'll call her first myself . __eou__ great . then call me and let me know if she's free .
this sucks . i hate buying lingerie . okay , just find something and get out of here . alright , these are fine . oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . __eou__ you look a little lost , can i help you ? __eou__ um , i ’ m just having a look around . it ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . i'm trying to find her something . __eou__ well , you can ’ t give her granny panties.have you thought about getting her somesleepwear ? we ’ ve got these lovely , silky nighties . or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . __eou__ sure that ’ s fine.this is so awkward ... what ones do i pick ? what size is she ? __eou__ well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? __eou__ just pick something and get the hell out of here.um , i'll go with these two.this is mortifying . i just want to get this over with.she better thank me for this ... __eou__ here you are , sir . i ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them . __eou__ finally ! __eou__ i ’ m sorry , sir . i ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag .
welcome to al ’ s garage . what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ no problem at all ! i am taking a long road trip and i want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . __eou__ very wise decision . when was the last time you had a tune up ? __eou__ not that long ago , i think it was four months ago . __eou__ we usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . __eou__ why ? i mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? __eou__ first of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . if you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . __eou__ i see . what else ? __eou__ we also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . we also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . __eou__ ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . __eou__ trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .
what do we need to get from the supermarket ? __eou__ we need lots of things . i ’ ll make a list . we need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer . __eou__ a crate of beer ? why do we need that ? __eou__ just joking . i would like to get a few bottles of beer though . we also need a liter of cooking oil . __eou__ we can buy a three-liter bottle . it works out cheaper per liter . we should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too . __eou__ i ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . do we need any meat ? __eou__ i think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . __eou__ ok . let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . we need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes . __eou__ we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . we can treat ourselves . __eou__ ok . we should get a few tins of tuna . anything else ? __eou__ i ’ d like a few cans of coke . we also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages . __eou__ let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . is that everything . __eou__ i think so . i ’ ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go .
honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ? __eou__ can ’ t it wait ? i ’ m watching the game right now ! __eou__ your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . __eou__ fine ! what do you need ? __eou__ ok , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . i think i saw a promotion for pastrami . also get s __eou__ whoa wait a minute ! isn ’ t that a bit too much ? i mean , how much is all of this going to cost ! __eou__ never mind that.get some dips as well . get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some tzatziki.if they have bean dip get that as well . last but not least , get some pickles . __eou__ is that all , your majesty ? __eou__ very funny ! get a move on ! people will be here any minute .
welcome to the national post . how may i help you ? __eou__ hi , i would like to send this package to china , and these postcards as well . __eou__ very well . you will need some stamps for the postcards and i need to weigh that package . __eou__ how much is this going to cost ? __eou__ well , it depends . do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ? __eou__ what ’ s the difference ? __eou__ well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . it only takes three days and you can track your package online . __eou__ i see . well , there ’ s no rush . please send it via priority mail . please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile .
have you bought a present for jim ’ s birthday yet ? __eou__ no , i haven ’ t . i can ’ t think of anything to get him . __eou__ i ’ m having the same problem . i want to get something really special . jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts . __eou__ i know . he bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday . it was exactly what i wanted . and it fit me perfectly ! __eou__ he bought me an iron . __eou__ that doesn ’ t sound like a great present . __eou__ maybe not , but my iron was getting old . in fact , it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one . it ’ s as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working ! __eou__ let ’ s think . he loves football , doesn ’ t he ? i saw signed photographs of famous footballers in a shop near hear . let ’ s go and have a look . you know which team he supports , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , i do . let ’ s go . we should be able to find something suitable . we should get him something old ... something historic . __eou__ it ’ ll be an expensive present , but we can share the cost . __eou__ i ’ ll be happy to get him something special , even if it coasts a little extra . __eou__ yes . he always get us special gift . we should repay his kindness .

in china at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . __eou__ maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . while they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they __eou__ yes . behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . young people easily become blind worshippers of a westernized life . while they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish __eou__ then what about tea ? we need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the chinese people . __eou__ well . tea represents another facet of popular culture . while a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . people visit tea __eou__ what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted lao she , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . it is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend __eou__ well , that's true . in a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink .
hello , 332440 . __eou__ oh hello , sally . this is dave thomson here . could i speak to jim please ? __eou__ i'm afraid he's not in at the moment dave . he went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet . __eou__ any idea when he might be back ? __eou__ well , he shouldn't be long . he said he was just going to get some paint . but i wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back . __eou__ ok . well , tell him i've called , will you , and i'll try again later . __eou__ all right . goodbye , dave . __eou__ thanks then sally . goodbye .
pardon me . could you please pass me the tissue ? __eou__ sure , here you are . __eou__ thanks , i didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . are you ok ? __eou__ yeah , i think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . but you are chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ well , not every chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from sichuan and cuizhou provinces can . back where i come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ oh , i see how this food can be really hard for you . i can sympathize with that . i stayed in sichuan for a year . the food was difficult at the beginning . every dish was so spicy . after a while , i got u __eou__ yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , i haven't had the need or the opportunity . every time i try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ i completely understand . i didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt . __eou__ yeah , i guess that's a typical example of when in rome , do as the romans do . __eou__ exactly .
my lease ends next month , so i have to find a new place . __eou__ i feel sorry for you . it's a jungle out there . __eou__ do you know any places ? __eou__ well . i guess i can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available . __eou__ thank you . i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . __eou__ how much do are you looking to spend ? __eou__ i can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . __eou__ looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs . __eou__ it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route . __eou__ anything you need to have in the place ? __eou__ i want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side . __eou__ you can also check out university bulletin boards . __eou__ why ? will those be students who are leaving ? __eou__ not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent . __eou__ thank you . i'll be sure to take a look . __eou__ good luck .
may i see a hat , please ? __eou__ what size do you take ? __eou__ i'm sorry . i don't know . __eou__ i'll measure you . . . you take size 6 . what colour hat would you like ? __eou__ brown , please . __eou__ here are some nice brown hats.try this hat on.it ' s a very good one . __eou__ yes , i like this one.it goes very well with my coat . how much is it ? __eou__ it's $ 9.95 . do you want me to put it in a box ?
that was a really good meal , gordon . __eou__ it sure was . i couldn't eat another bite . __eou__ well , it is getting pretty late . i think we should go home . __eou__ you're right . i have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . __eou__ let's see how much the bill is . __eou__ don't worry about it . tonight is my treat . __eou__ what are you talking about ? we'll split the bill . __eou__ no , i insist . i kept telling you that i would treat you to dinner but i still haven't . __eou__ no way , gordon . i know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . there's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . __eou__ alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . __eou__ that's better . this way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . __eou__ just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? __eou__ you've got a deal . __eou__ great . bye . __eou__ bye .
hey , robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . where did you get it ? __eou__ thanks , i like it too . i bought it at the nearby department store . __eou__ that's nice . do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? __eou__ yeah , i know that . but at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . __eou__ true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to china for the first time . __eou__ yeah , but personally , i hate bargaining . if i bargain , i might come to a lower price , but i will never know the true price of what i am buying ; and i always have the feeling that i am overcharged at th __eou__ yeah , i have the same feeling . also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . but at a wholesale market , you never know whether w __eou__ that's why i like department stores more . shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things i am unable to grow accustomed to . __eou__ i understand . while it's always good to follow the local customs , i guess there are exceptions .
oh , sam ! is this your dog ? __eou__ it's cindy , you know that . hey , cindy , say hello to maria . __eou__ cindy , you're so cute . __eou__ she is also very naughty . by the way , do you have a dog , maria ? __eou__ i have a little white cat . __eou__ oh , a cat ? come on . __eou__ yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . __eou__ but i think they're dull , aren't they ? __eou__ not at all . they're quiet most of the time.but they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . __eou__ well , cats are certainly more independent . __eou__ absolutely . believe it or not , i found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . __eou__ oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? __eou__ yes . it was starving and looking for something to eat when i saw it . __eou__ poor cat . __eou__ now we get along very well . it makes me feel that i'm someone special .
i swear i will never shop at a street market in china . it's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! you have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . __eou__ cool down , harry ! what are you really mad about ? did you get ripped off ? __eou__ yes . last sunday i went to a nearby market . it was on open-air fair . i chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . i paid one hundred and twenty . and just __eou__ is that so ? i'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . it's the norm of free trade . the seller sets __eou__ but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? __eou__ of course , that's something really irritation . and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . i recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb
oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! no wonder there are few people . __eou__ beauty costs , dear ! what do you think of this dress ? do you think it suits me ? __eou__ yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . you don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? __eou__ come on , you sound like my mom.look at that , it's beautiful ! __eou__ when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . __eou__ maybe you have a point . __eou__ make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . __eou__ all right . how about this black shirt ? it can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! __eou__ that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . __eou__ oh ! hey , look , that's the same shirt britney wore in her concert . __eou__ exactly ! oh , my god ! i love britney ! i'm going to get it . __eou__ why not try it on ? __eou__ it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! i'll take it . oh , no , i'm a little short . did you bring your credit card ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ i promise i'll pay you back as soon as we get home .
can i get you something to drink ? __eou__ sure , but i don't drink much . so i don't know what to order . __eou__ so how about an aperitif ? __eou__ it sounds good . i'd like to start with a compare . __eou__ stirred or shaken ? __eou__ stirred will be fine . __eou__ here you are . __eou__ thanks . does the bar have a signature drink ? __eou__ sure . all of our mixed drinks are excellent . you can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail . __eou__ can you recommend one ? __eou__ try a singer . it has lime juice and grenadine over ice . __eou__ it sounds interesting . i'll take one . __eou__ here we go . __eou__ it tastes great . __eou__ enjoy yourself . __eou__ yeah .
i'm going to the hospital to see susan green . __eou__ i saw her yesterday . she was a little better . __eou__ must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ? __eou__ no , you needn't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . __eou__ number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? __eou__ yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and i had to wait for half an hour at the bus stop __eou__ thank you , henry . i'll get a number 13 . __eou__ but number 13 buses leave from the centre of town . you'll have to walk two miles to catch one .
my mp3 player is broken , so i want to change it for an mp4 player . can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? __eou__ an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? you can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . __eou__ oh , that's a good idea . perhaps i should have a try . __eou__ look at my cell phone . i can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . it's just like a pad . __eou__ that's cool . i can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but i'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . __eou__ that's ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . __eou__ yeah , if i buy a cell phone like this , i don't have to take a music player everywhere i go , and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . __eou__ that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? __eou__ 256mb . __eou__ then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512mb .
hi , sam . i want to buy a pet . do you have any ideas ? __eou__ you really should go to rachel's pet store . __eou__ why ? anything special there ? __eou__ it's more than special . you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . __eou__ oh , really ? are there any snakes ? __eou__ snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . __eou__ that's terrific . i can't wait to check it out . __eou__ hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? __eou__ why not ? it's so cool . __eou__ but it will pose a risk to your health . __eou__ pardon ? __eou__ i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems . __eou__ well , i didn't realize that . __eou__ i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . __eou__ oh , i should have thought of my brother's baby girl . maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . __eou__ yes , good luck , maria .
there isn't much rice , is there ? __eou__ no , there isn't , but there are some vegetables . __eou__ are there any potatoes ? __eou__ no , there aren't . i'm sorry . __eou__ i'm very hungry , donald . what can i eat ? __eou__ there's a little bread and there are a few biscuits . __eou__ but i want some rice and some meat . __eou__ all right , i'll walk to the village and i'll get some meat . __eou__ good . by the way , who's going to cook the meat ? __eou__ you'll cook it of course !
your mp3 looks so cool . where did you get it ? __eou__ i bought it online . __eou__ really ? do you often shop online ? __eou__ yes . i buy most of my daily necessities online . __eou__ i've never tried e-shopping . is it better than shopping at an actual store ? __eou__ yes , much better . you can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . __eou__ sounds good , and i don't have to queue up at the cashier . __eou__ and you can still go " window shopping " just like in a real shopping mall . __eou__ well , are there any other advantages ? __eou__ yes , most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . __eou__ are there many choices of online shopping ? __eou__ sure . you can buy almost anything you can think of . __eou__ perhaps i should have a try .
don't throw paper on the floor , bill . __eou__ where shall i put it , miss ? __eou__ put it in the waste-paper basket , please . __eou__ but peter and tony put all their paper in the basket a few moments ago.now it's full . __eou__ in that case , take the basket outside and empty it . __eou__ yes , miss . __eou__ where did you empty the basket , bill ? __eou__ in the playground , miss . __eou__ silly boy ! the dustbin is at the back of the school . now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri .
how can i get to lakeside park ? __eou__ take the no . 7 bus . there's a bus stop just over there . __eou__ will it take me straight there ? __eou__ yes . no need to change .
no , it hasn't . it's very dirty . __eou__ someone ought to clean it today . __eou__ mark should clean it . it's his turn . __eou__ no , he cleaned it last time . it's your turn . __eou__ no , it isn't . you always clean it after mark . __eou__ oh dear , is it really my turn ? in that case , i'll clean tomorrow . __eou__ clean it now . only lazy people say they'll work tomorrow . __eou__ then i'll clean it the day after tomorrow . __eou__ you are lazy . you ought to be ashamed ? you should enjoy working .
ok darling , got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese ! __eou__ oh john , i thought we said we would start eating right ! remember ? our new healthy lifestyle ? that ’ s all junk food ! __eou__ humph ! right , so what did you get ? __eou__ well , healthy food , of course ! i got some whole wheat bread , skimmed milk , fresh fish and organic carrots ... __eou__ organic ? what ’ s organic ? do we need organic carrots ... ? __eou__ they were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . and yes , john , we need organic carrots ... __eou__ oh , so organic vegetables are the green option , right ? __eou__ yup , better for the environment and better for us ! __eou__ wait a minute , that ? ... doughnuts ? they organic doughnuts , kelly ? __eou__ i like doughnuts .
hello , could i speak to allison , please ? __eou__ i'm sorry ; he's out at the moment . __eou__ when do you expect him back ? __eou__ i think he'll be back in about an hour at least . __eou__ well , may i leave a message ? __eou__ yes , of course . __eou__ would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ? __eou__ ok . does he know your number ? __eou__ i'm afraid he doesn't . my mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 . __eou__ 13924774026 . all right . thanks for calling . oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
how about this floor lamp ? __eou__ fine , just get it ! we have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! i ’ m so tired ! __eou__ we still need to find an armoire and a dresser . __eou__ fine ! i am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . __eou__ great ! pick me up in about an hour because i think i ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . __eou__ while you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? i really want one so i can watch tv . __eou__ recliner ? in my beautifully decorated living room ? i don ’ t think so !

i have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and i still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! __eou__ what are you getting ? __eou__ well , the first thing on my list is a new blender . i decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker . __eou__ don ’ t forget to also get a new mixer . i lent the old one to my brother and he broke it . __eou__ yeah i know . i also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . i am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies . __eou__ i ’ m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove , oven , dishwasher and trash compacter . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea ! the kitchen will look amazing !

why did your parents make you stay at home ? __eou__ they wanted to go out , and so they made me look after my baby brother . __eou__ didn't you mind doing it ? __eou__ no , i didn't . my brother was very good and i did quite a lot of homework . __eou__ didn't you even want to go to the cinema ? __eou__ not really . i watched television for an hour . __eou__ what was on television last night ? __eou__ boxing . it was excellent . __eou__ oh . i enjoy watching boxing on television , too.what a pity i missed it last night ! __eou__ what did you do last night ? __eou__ i went to a boxing match in the sports stadium .
hello . __eou__ hello , claire . this is mick . __eou__ mick ! nice to hear from you again . how are you ? __eou__ fine , thanks . and you ? __eou__ oh , not so bad . i've been very busy , but i'm going away on holiday soon . __eou__ good . listen . i'm phoning because i want to invite you to a party . at our newhouse . and . . __eou__ new house ? really ? __eou__ yes . we've moved . that's why we're giving the party . can you come ? __eou__ well , that depends . when is it ? __eou__ this saturday evening . __eou__ well . . . i'm going away on sunday morning . very early . will the party go convery late ? __eou__ until two in the morning . but you don't have to stay that long.well ? what about it ? __eou__ all right . i'll come . but i'd like to bring a present something for your new house.what would you like ? __eou__ nothing . i mean , don't bring anything . it isn't necessary . __eou__ but i'd still like ... __eou__ just bring yourself ! i'm looking forward to seeingyou again . it's been a long time ! __eou__ yes , it has . i'm looking forward to seeing you . too . and your new house . uh . . . when does the party start ? __eou__ come any time after eight . all right ? . __eou__ yes . oh . by the w .. __eou__ bye ! see you on saturday evening . __eou__ wait a moment , mick . you haven't . . . mick ? are you still there ? you haven'tgiven me your new address . hello ? mick ? hello ?

mom , give me a glass of orange juice . __eou__ what the magic ward to say if you want something good to happen ? __eou__ oh , sorry mom , i forgot.please give me a glass of orange juice . __eou__ ok , here you are . __eou__ oh , it is nice and cold , definitely good orange juice . __eou__ amy , you forgot another magic word . __eou__ oh , sorry again , thank you mom . __eou__ you are very welcome .
do you think children watch too much tv ? __eou__ i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don ’ t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first . __eou__ if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . if you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ they could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit .
do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? __eou__ yes , i do . i also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . there are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c __eou__ how often do you run your anti-virus program ? __eou__ i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time . __eou__ which anti-virus program would you recommend ? __eou__ have you tried this one ? it ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free . __eou__ that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ? __eou__ just a minute ... go to this one . i ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated . __eou__ what do you use your computer for ? __eou__ i use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . i don ’ t play many games on my computer , but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program , you __eou__ computers are great , aren ’ t they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
i heard there is a big yard sale at weeks this saturday morning , i will go there to see if there is some nice clothes , do you want to go with me ? __eou__ well , i want to go to the university flea market , they got times of books , dvds , and a lot of nice clothing , too . __eou__ how about we go to the yard sale first and then to the university flea market ? __eou__ good idea , let's shop to we drop !
hello , sir , what can i do for you today ? __eou__ hello , i need a new suit . i have an important interview next week , so i really need to look sharp . __eou__ no problem ! we have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly . __eou__ great ! i want a three piece suit , preferably made from italian cashmere or wool . __eou__ very well sir . would you like to have some shirts made also ? __eou__ sure . i ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties . __eou__ very good . now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .
hi ! i see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . __eou__ there ’ s so much i want to do . i ’ ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download . __eou__ i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . __eou__ thanks . that would be very helpful . i ’ ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there ’ s too much information on the net . __eou__ when you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? __eou__ yes , i did . there ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so i ’ m sure i haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . __eou__ when you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things . __eou__ that ’ s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__ that ’ s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time __eou__ how do i do that ? __eou__ take this web page for example . press the keys control and d together . click on favourites at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it , you will __eou__ that ’ s useful to know . thanks . i ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
how often do you use the internet ? __eou__ i use it almost every day , but i usually only use it to check my email . i don ’ t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor . __eou__ so , you ’ re online eight hours a day . __eou__ yes , i like the job though . sometimes , i help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . __eou__ how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? __eou__ i think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . first , a lot of the information you find online is false . second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . __eou__ how do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? __eou__ what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
hi ! is that the new laptop you brought last week ? it looks very nice . __eou__ yes , it is . thanks . i ’ m just surfing on the internet . __eou__ here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ? __eou__ this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i ’ m here . of course , i have to buy a cup of coffee ! __eou__ that ’ s great . can you do it anywhere ? __eou__ no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . __eou__ so , what programs do you have on your laptop ? __eou__ i ’ ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs . __eou__ i know you are keen on photography . it ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a __eou__ it ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?
you're finally here ! what took so long ? __eou__ i got stuck in traffic again . there was a terrible traffic jam near the carrefour intersection . __eou__ it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . __eou__ i don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . __eou__ perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . __eou__ i think it's something that i'll have to consider . the public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ it would be better for the environment , too . __eou__ i know . i feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . __eou__ taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . __eou__ the only problem is that i'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . __eou__ well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . that will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . __eou__ that's true . i could certainly use the exercise ! __eou__ so , are you going to quit driving to work then ? __eou__ yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .
i ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat . __eou__ yeah me too . oh ! can we stop at the shop really fast ? i lost my makeup bag at the airport and i want to pick up a few things . __eou__ will you take long ? __eou__ no ! five minutes i promise ! __eou__ come on ! we have been here for almost an hour ! i thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! how long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish ! __eou__ are you crazy ? you have no idea what you are talking about ! just for my eyes i have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . then i need to get foundation , liq __eou__ whoa whoa whoa ! are you nuts ? how much is all this going to cost ? i ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! this is basically a crayon ! __eou__ what about you ? you spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... __eou__ fine ! get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
may i help you ? __eou__ i hope so , do you have a shopping skirts ? something i could wear working in a ban ? __eou__ sure , here you are . __eou__ it is nice , may i try it on ? __eou__ yes , the fitting room is over there , it looks fantastic on you , this style color in sizes natural here and figure , perfectly . __eou__ does this fashion really fit my figure ? __eou__ i think so , but the true thing is you look sharp in any style . __eou__ oh , thank you , just shows you what is going to max jemmy redate for all this body . __eou__ absolutely , i go to there to work three times a week , bend it for 6 month now . __eou__ i thought you recognize she from there . __eou__ oh , you like the rolling machine . __eou__ yes , it is really good for my arms and shoulders , ok , i will take this one , do you have a blue in this size style ? i want one for my sister , she has a great figure and she loves blue . __eou__ no problem , is this blue ok ? __eou__ oh , good , do you have a discount for two ? __eou__ yes , we do , there is a 90 percent for two . __eou__ that is great , i will take this two , how much is that ? __eou__ the total is 90 dollars including tax . __eou__ ok , 90 dollars , do you accept this card ? __eou__ yes , we do , debit or credit ? __eou__ debit card . __eou__ please keen your key number here , do you want to any extra cash back ? __eou__ no , thanks . __eou__ have a good day . __eou__ thanks , you too , how see your maxes sometime . __eou__ great , take care . __eou__ thanks , byebye .

i'm glad we came here . this is really delicious ! __eou__ i was worried you would think it was too far to drive . __eou__ well , it's true i've never driven two hours just to get lunch.but really , i think it's worth it . __eou__ i think if you try some more authentic chinese food , you might understand how we students from taiwan suffer . __eou__ how do you mean " suffer " ? __eou__ i mean , in milwaukee there is no good chinese food.so we miss the food in taiwan too much.sometimes we just have to drive down here to chicago to find something better . __eou__ even in the winter ? __eou__ yes , even in the winter . __eou__ and even if it takes two hours , huh ? __eou__ why not ? i've been craving good food for three weeks now . i'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! __eou__ well , this really is delicious , i have to admit . i can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . __eou__ don't tease me ! good food is really important to chinese ! __eou__ i know . i can see that . this is what is called " dim sum , " right ? __eou__ yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.you can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in america . __eou__ so when you chinese think of chinatown , you mostly think of food . is that right ? __eou__ of course . i will try to buy some things at the asian grocery down the block too.then i can do a little cooking in my apartment . __eou__ and maybe we can go to a good italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.chicago has some great italian restaurants . __eou__ no way ! __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ we're going up to the " new " chinatown for dinner . i already know where we're going to go . __eou__ alright , alright . i am happy to try more chinese food.will it be dim sum again ? __eou__ no , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.we ' ll try more taiwanese style up at the " new " chinatown . __eou__ taiwanese style ? isn't dim sum taiwanese style ? __eou__ no , dim sum is more cantonese style.but of course you can buy it in taiwan . __eou__ i wonder if you can cook things this good . __eou__ i'm a great cook actually . you will see .
why don't you watch where you're going ? __eou__ me ? you're the one who pulled out in front of me ! __eou__ there was plenty of room for me to pull out.you didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . __eou__ hey , listen . i had every right to stay in the lane i was in.you were supposed to wait until i passed to pull out.and anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.all of a sudden--bang--there you are right in front of me . __eou__ i think my arm is broken . __eou__ sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . you need to learn how to drive . you're lucky you didn't get killed . and i'm lucky to be alive too . __eou__ listen , let's just wait until the police get here.then we can decide whose fault this accident was . __eou__ fine with me . i know the laws of the road . i'm not worried . __eou__ i have a cell phone in my car . now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.why don't you get it for me , and then i can call the police ? __eou__ alright . __eou__ it doesn't work . it looks like it's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there . __eou__ oh , yeah ? it's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital . __eou__ damn it ! i'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police . __eou__ well , you'll just have to wait . i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . don't worry . you'll get to the hospital in time . __eou__ it really hurts . __eou__ yes , maybe it does.but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ? __eou__ to hell with you . the accident was your fault . __eou__ i'm afraid it wasn't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . but enough of this bickering . i'm going to go find a phone.don ' t move that arm while i'm gone . alright ? __eou__ to hell with you .
excuse me . __eou__ yeah ? __eou__ i've never used this place before.can you give me some idea what i need to do ? __eou__ you just put quarters in the machines.it ' s easy . __eou__ yes , but ... well ... __eou__ what ? __eou__ how do i use the machines ? __eou__ what do you mean ? these are the washing machines . those big things over there are the dryers . __eou__ i see . do the machines have soap in them ? __eou__ no , of course not . you have to put soap in . did you bring your soap ? __eou__ no . i don't have soap . __eou__ well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there . __eou__ thanks.okay . i have my soap . __eou__ my god ! you really bought a lot . why do you need so much ? __eou__ i don't know . i want my clothes to be clean . __eou__ but you can't use so much.the machine won't be able to rinse the soap out . __eou__ oh . i guess i didn't know . i have never washed clothes before . __eou__ what ? did you say you never washed clothes before ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ in your life ? are you kidding ? never ? __eou__ no . never . __eou__ i can't believe it . how can that be ? how old are you ? __eou__ i'm nineteen . __eou__ but how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ? __eou__ my mother always did it . __eou__ yes , my mother washed my clothes too.but when i was twelve , i started to wash clothes myself . __eou__ i know about this fact.american children are more independent . they do more for themselves.but i am from taiwan . in taiwan , children must study very hard.so the mother does everything for the kids.the mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.so i've never washed clothes before . you shouldn't laugh at me for it . __eou__ i'm not laughing at you . but let me ask you something ? __eou__ what ? __eou__ how are you going to survive here ? i mean , if you can't do anything for yourself.if you can't cook , if you can't wash clothes , if you can't clean house.how can you live on your own ? __eou__ i don't know . it's hard . but i have to learn . __eou__ well , i'll help you learn how to use these machines . __eou__ thanks . my name's nick . __eou__ i'm alice . i guess i'll have to be your mother for today . __eou__ thanks , mom . thanks .
honey , the house is such a mess ! i need you to help me tidy up a bit . my boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless ! __eou__ i ’ m in the middle of something right now . i ’ ll be there in a second . __eou__ this can ’ t wait ! i need your help now ! __eou__ alright , alright . i ’ m coming . __eou__ ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . i'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.you can sweep and mop the floors . oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted . __eou__ you know what , i have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and i'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries . __eou__ sure that ’ s fine . here is the list of all the things you need to get . don't forget anything ! and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ? __eou__ hey , honey i ’ m back . wow , the house looks really good ! __eou__ great ! can you set the table ? __eou__ just a sec i ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast . __eou__ wait ! don ’ t turn it on ...
dad , i ’ d like to borrow some money . __eou__ sure , johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? __eou__ come on , dad , i need thirty thousand . i wanna get into the market . you know , i ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . i look at this as an opportunity . this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__ i don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there ’ s just too much instability . i wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . __eou__ but look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.and anyway , i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . there are emerging markets that promise great returns . look at china , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . __eou__ come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . __eou__ fine , then ! if that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . but you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . i ’ m going to go hit up mum for the cash .
wow , you ’ re up early today ! what ’ s for breakfast ? __eou__ well , i felt like baking , so i made some muffins . __eou__ smells good ! i ’ ll make some coffee . do you want me to make you some eggs ? __eou__ sure , i'll take mine , sunny side up . __eou__ www , i don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! ever since i was small , i ’ ve had eggs and soldiers . __eou__ you know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . it drove my mom crazy ! __eou__ you know what really drives me crazy ? when i ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! how can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ? __eou__ you ’ re so picky sometimes . __eou__ here you go , honey , fried eggs . __eou__ i said sunny side up ! how many times do i have to tell you .
i really appreciate your driving me around . __eou__ it's no problem . i have time today , and i think it's important that you find a good place . __eou__ it would be hard for just me to do it . i don't know the city at all . __eou__ so what do you see in there ? __eou__ this one sounds good.efficiency with view of the lake.utilities and parking included . newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 . __eou__ can you afford that much ? __eou__ no , i guess not . but that's what i want , isn't it ? an efficiency . __eou__ yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.usually one large room and a small bathroom.there is often a small kitchen too . so it's good for one person . __eou__ how about this one ? downtown efficiency . furnished ... what does furnished mean ? __eou__ that means the apartment has furniture in it . __eou__ that's good . __eou__ sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . you have to like the furniture . __eou__ furnished . parking included . $ 400 . __eou__ it's still pretty expensive . __eou__ yes , but it's downtown . i would like to take look at this one . __eou__ alright . what's the phone number ? __eou__ 256-7797 . __eou__ got it . what else do you see ? __eou__ this one . two male grad students seeking roommate.must be quiet . comfortable downtown apartment.does this mean i have to share a room with them ? __eou__ no . it probably means they have a large apartment.probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.they need someone for the empty bedroom . __eou__ that sounds alright . __eou__ yes , it might be an advantage for you . you are a foreigner , after all.if they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them . __eou__ here's the number , 256-4367 . __eou__ got it.let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments . __eou__ sounds good to me . i really appreciate your help on this . __eou__ don't mention it , larry . what are friends for anyway ?
can i help you ? __eou__ yes , i would like to buy a walkman . can you tell me about the models you have ? __eou__ well , we have a lot of models here.did you want to listen to cd's or cassettes or the radio ? __eou__ mostly cassette tapes . __eou__ alright . there are several models you may want to look at.this kreng portable cassette player is very good . __eou__ kreng ? i've never heard of that company . __eou__ it's a german company.this unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an am / fm radio band.it also has a built-in microphone . __eou__ i suppose i don't want that one then . i don't like auto-reverse . it breaks too easily . __eou__ really ? have you had an auto-reverse break before ? __eou__ yes , twice now . i think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks . __eou__ hmm . you know , the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ? __eou__ well . no , i didn't clean it.but still , i only had the last one two months , and it broke . i don't trust auto-reverse . __eou__ alright . well . we have many units without auto-reverse.here is a good unit . very reliable.it has an am / fm band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse . __eou__ how much is it ? __eou__ this one sells for $ 39.99 . __eou__ can i test it out ? __eou__ of course . __eou__ it sounds great . i'll take it . __eou__ fine . i think you'll be happy with it . it's a very good unit . very reliable . i'll go get you a new one in a box . i will be back in just a moment . __eou__ thanks .
ah ! it hurts . don't touch it . __eou__ what part hurts ? __eou__ the shoulder . __eou__ well , maybe you broke it . but what i'm worried about is this cut . __eou__ it's not a cut . it's a gash ! it's bigger than a cut ! ah ! i need a doctor . __eou__ c'mon . just don't move . __eou__ i'm bleeding too much . __eou__ we don't have a decent first aid kit , do we ? __eou__ yes . my bike has one under the seat . get it , quick ! __eou__ there's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . i don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . what we need is a tourniquet . __eou__ wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.that will work as a tourniquet.after that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . __eou__ good plan . let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__ no , forget that ! do the tourniquet first . i'm losing too much blood . __eou__ alright , alright . how did you cut this so bad ? __eou__ i ran it against that fence pole as i crashed . what do you think ? damn , it hurts ! __eou__ we'll have to get you to a hospital . i can ride you on the back of my bike . __eou__ i'm lucky i wasn't killed . i must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.there was too much gravel on that corner . i slid out . __eou__ yes , i almost slid too.alright . this tourniquet is tight . how does it feel ? __eou__ make it tighter . i want the blood stopped.then wrap some bandages around the cut . then we can go . ouch ! i hope i can walk . __eou__ alright , i'm twisting it around . you tell me when to stop . __eou__ there . stop !

i think you made the right choice , coming to us.we have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from . __eou__ i would like to rent a car with a good stereo . __eou__ all our cars have stereos in them.stereos , air conditioning . it's all standard with us . __eou__ good . i am here visiting my girlfriend . i want her to have a good time . __eou__ oh , is that so ? well , then . let me show you something she might like . it's on our back lot . __eou__ this is a porsche ! __eou__ yes . beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ but i probably can't afford it . it must be really expensive . __eou__ well , sir . you said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.but you could probably rent this porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars . __eou__ but how can you do that ? __eou__ it's because our prices are so good.and this car has a lot of miles on it . but it's in nice shape , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , it almost looks new .
i have a cell phone in my car . now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.why don't you get it for me , and then i can call the police ? __eou__ alright . __eou__ it doesn't work . it looks like it's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there . __eou__ oh , yeah ? it's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital . __eou__ damn it ! i'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police . __eou__ well , you'll just have to wait . i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . don't worry . you'll get to the hospital in time . __eou__ it really hurts . __eou__ yes , maybe it does.but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ? __eou__ to hell with you . the accident was your fault . __eou__ i'm afraid it wasn't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . but enough of this bickering . i'm going to go find a phone.don ' t move that arm while i'm gone . alright ? __eou__ to hell with you .
take a seat inside and see what you think.so you will take the porsche then , sir ? __eou__ yes , and i want to buy the insurance too . i think it's necessary . __eou__ you're smart to buy it . at 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal . __eou__ can i return the car in san francisco ? __eou__ san francisco ? no , sir.we only have this office here . you will have to return it here . __eou__ really ? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities . __eou__ no , sir . that's only with the very big companies . i'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . __eou__ well , i guess i will have to drive back down then . hmm . i didn't think of that . __eou__ do you still want the car , sir ? __eou__ yes . it will be fun . driving back down the coast . my girlfriend will like it . __eou__ it's a beautiful drive . __eou__ where are the keys ? __eou__ just a moment , sir . we have to finish filling out the forms .
what are we going to do ? i can't get the car out of this ditch . i'm stuck ! __eou__ i'm worried , tom . i haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__ i know . this is terrible . what can we do ? this snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ i told you we should have stayed in town today.the weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ i wanted to show you the cabin . we only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ well , now we're stuck . what can we do ? __eou__ i don't know . __eou__ i've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ we're stranded here , tom . we may be here a long time.we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ i have plenty of gas . __eou__ yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.we can't just let the car run and run.if we do , it will die soon . then we'll freeze . __eou__ so what can we do ? __eou__ turn the lights off.then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.that will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ alright . that's a good idea . __eou__ i wish we hadn't come up here . now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ days ? __eou__ yes , it happens.that is what happens in big snowstorms . people get stranded for days . __eou__ oh , my god ! it's good we have food . __eou__ probably we'll survive.but turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . then we'll turn it on again . __eou__ okay , i'll follow your advice .
good afternoon , sir , is there anything i can help you with today ? __eou__ umm ... yeah ! i ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . our fifth anniversary ’ s next friday . __eou__ well , i would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . is there anything particular that you have in mind ? __eou__ no , not really ... i ’ m completely at a loss . __eou__ well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . what is her favorite gemstone ? __eou__ that purple one . i ’ m sorry ... i ’ ve never bought jewellery for anyone and i ’ m kind of nervous . __eou__ don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . that stone is an amethyst . we have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . take a look at this bracelet . it ’ s 18k rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . it ’ s a great statement piece . __eou__ oh ... wow . that ’ s really pretty.jess would love that . but ... i was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? __eou__ we have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . you could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.if you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe i can help you find something for her . __eou__ jess ? well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . she ’ s very feminine ... __eou__ perhaps you could give her a ring ? __eou__ well ... actually ... i was thinking about asking jess to marry me ... i ’ ve just been so nervous . __eou__ well sir , i believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! __eou__ okay , i ’ ve decided . i ’ m going to pop the question ! __eou__ fabulous ! we should look at engagement rings then ! now that ’ s a whole other section .

i ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please . __eou__ certainly . have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? we have a selection of materials over here . __eou__ well , i thought that i would choose either this one or that one . i really want a dark blue suit . which do you recommend . __eou__ this material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality . __eou__ yes . i can feel the difference in material . there ’ s not much difference in price . ok , i ’ ll take the more expensive one . __eou__ fine . i ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . i ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su __eou__ that ’ s fine . i would also like a few shirts and a jacket . i don ’ t need them specially made . those shirts over there look very nice . are they made of cotton ? __eou__ yes , they are . how many would you like and of which color ? __eou__ i ’ ll take three light blue ones , please . __eou__ are you looking for a casual jacket or something formal ? __eou__ just a casual one - a sport jacket . this one looks nice . i ’ ll just try it on ... yes , that ’ s fine . i ’ ll take it . here ’ s my credit card . __eou__ thank you very much , sir . i ’ ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you . __eou__ thank you very much . i ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow .
may i speak to the apartment building manager , please ? __eou__ i'm the manager . how can i help you ? __eou__ i was hoping that the apartment on main street was still available . __eou__ why , yes , it is . would you like to get a look inside the apartment ? __eou__ yes , it would be nice to see the apartment . __eou__ how about today at 6 o'clock ? __eou__ yes , i can be there at 6 . __eou__ sounds good . i'll see you at 6 . do you want directions ? __eou__ i'm okay , thank you . i already checked out the address on mapquest . __eou__ if you like the place , you can fill out an application form . i'll bring one with me . __eou__ is there anything that i need to bring with me ? __eou__ no . i won't need to see anything except your driver's license .
good morning . i ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . could you help me ? __eou__ certainly . as you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . __eou__ i came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . i think i like the black leather suite . it's on sale , isn't it . __eou__ yes . the price has been reduced by 50 % . it ’ s a real bargain . __eou__ i ’ ll take it . i also need to improve the lighting in my living room . do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . how big is your living room ? __eou__ it ’ s quite large . it ’ s about 40 square meters . __eou__ i ’ d suggest you buy two . that allows you to change the brightness of the room better . __eou__ ok . i like the design of this lamps . i also need some cushion covers . i ’ ll just browse through those ones over there .
this house is not looking all that great from here __eou__ you can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside . let ’ s go inside . __eou__ i don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here . __eou__ i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better . __eou__ it is just too dark in here with so few windows . __eou__ i hear that the kitchen is quite large . let ’ s go check it out . __eou__ the kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space . __eou__ the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . maybe it will be a little better . __eou__ how many dogs live in this house ? __eou__ i think that we have seen all that we need to see here . let ’ s go look at another house .
oh , i am not sure i even want to look at this house ! __eou__ it is a bit of a fixer-upper . let ’ s take a look inside . __eou__ it doesn ’ t look much better inside this place . __eou__ you know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit . __eou__ there are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy . __eou__ let ’ s go check out the kitchen . the printout says that it is quite large . __eou__ look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper . __eou__ maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . follow me , please . __eou__ what ’ s that smell ? __eou__ perhaps we should move on to the next listing .
hi , can i speak with the apartment manager , please ? __eou__ hello , this is the apartment manager speaking . __eou__ i'm calling about the apartment for rent on main street . __eou__ would you be interested in seeing the apartment ? __eou__ i would love to see it . __eou__ are you free today at around 6 p . m . ? __eou__ yes , i will be able to make it then . __eou__ well , i'll see you at 6 p . m . do you know how to get there ? __eou__ i used to live in that area . __eou__ i'll give you an application form when i see you . __eou__ that sounds good . do i need to bring anything ? __eou__ no . just bring yourself .
how are you today ? __eou__ great , thanks . __eou__ can i help you ? __eou__ i would actually like to view the apartment for rent today . __eou__ i ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ you have to make an appointment first . __eou__ oh , okay . can i do that right now ? __eou__ is this friday okay ? __eou__ is 6 o ’ clock friday evening okay ? __eou__ yes , i will schedule you for that time . __eou__ thank you very much . see you then .
how ’ s it going ? __eou__ i ’ m fine , thank you . __eou__ did you need help with something ? __eou__ if i could , i would like to view the apartment sometime today . __eou__ that won ’ t be possible today . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ you can only view the apartment with an appointment . __eou__ i would like to make one right now if i can . __eou__ are you available this friday ? __eou__ can we do it at 6 o ’ clock ? __eou__ your appointment for friday at 6 pm has been confirmed . __eou__ all right . i ’ ll see you on friday .
could i speak to the apartment manager ? __eou__ i am the apartment manager . how can i help you ? __eou__ i wanted to know if that apartment on main street is still for rent . __eou__ i haven't rented it out yet . would you like to see it ? __eou__ yes , i want to see it . __eou__ how about today at 6 p . m . ? __eou__ that time is okay with me . __eou__ very good . we'll meet at 6 . do you need directions ? __eou__ no , thank you . i go by there on my way to work . __eou__ if you're interested , you can fill out an application form . __eou__ that's a good idea . do i need to bring anything myself ? __eou__ no . the only thing i need to see is your driver's license .
what are your thoughts on the apartment ? __eou__ i think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . __eou__ there aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ? __eou__ i think that the apartment looks very nice , but i do see some problems . __eou__ what problems ? __eou__ i did notice a few stains in the carpet . __eou__ we will have the carpet cleaned before you move in . __eou__ you will ? __eou__ yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ? __eou__ that was the only thing that i saw that was wrong with the apartment . __eou__ i ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . __eou__ it is . i love it .
what do you think about the apartment so far ? __eou__ it is beautiful . __eou__ you don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ? __eou__ actually , there is a problem . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ there are some stains that were left in the carpet . __eou__ those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in . __eou__ oh , is that right ? __eou__ yes . now what other problems do you have ? __eou__ that was the only problem that i saw . __eou__ well , i ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking . __eou__ i honestly love it .
how are you doing ? __eou__ everything ’ s fine with me . __eou__ what can i do for you today ? __eou__ is it possible for me to view the apartment today ? __eou__ unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today . __eou__ why can ’ t i view it today ? __eou__ you ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment . __eou__ i understand . may i make an appointment then ? __eou__ how does this friday sound ? __eou__ friday at 6 pm . would be perfect . __eou__ that will be fine . __eou__ thanks for your help .
do you like the apartment ? __eou__ i absolutely love the apartment . __eou__ everything is okay ? __eou__ i do have one problem with the apartment . __eou__ what ’ s the problem ? __eou__ i don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet . __eou__ we will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment . __eou__ i did not know that . __eou__ i assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me . __eou__ that was the only thing that i saw wrong with the apartment . __eou__ i ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice . __eou__ it ’ s absolutely incredible . i ’ ll take it .
i would love to rent out your apartment . __eou__ that ’ s great . __eou__ how much is the rent ? __eou__ the rent each month is $ 1050 . __eou__ that ’ s a lot of money . __eou__ did you have a better price in mind ? __eou__ what about $ 800 ? __eou__ that ’ s way too low . __eou__ i can ’ t pay much more than that . __eou__ how about $ 900 a month ? __eou__ that would be fine . __eou__ great . it was a pleasure doing business with you .
i heard that you finished my home inspection , and i was wondering how it went . __eou__ first of all , we need to understand what i was looking for . do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? __eou__ i am not sure what a home inspection is all about . __eou__ i went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in . __eou__ wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ? __eou__ sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of . __eou__ can i require the owners to fix the problems ? __eou__ you can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems . __eou__ what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ? __eou__ there were no major problems . one leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that i found .
what would be the earliest that i could actually move into my new house ? __eou__ the keys will be turned in on tuesday night . the house will be yours at that time . __eou__ what should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ? __eou__ you can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name . __eou__ there are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning . __eou__ take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . it will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . __eou__ i asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in . __eou__ that will be good . you are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away . __eou__ i could use some help on moving day . what are you doing on saturday ? __eou__ i think i am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . here , feel how hot my head is !
can you tell me the results of my home inspection ? __eou__ before i answer that , i want to make sure that you know what i was looking for . are you clear on what i was looking for ? __eou__ i never had a home inspection before . __eou__ i inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through . __eou__ i asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house . __eou__ the owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future . __eou__ i heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes . __eou__ i inform you of the problems . if there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems . __eou__ what kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ? __eou__ i found some fairly major problems . a major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist .
what would be a good day to finally move into the house ? __eou__ you can pick up your keys on tuesday night . when you actually move in is up to you . __eou__ will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ? __eou__ make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in . __eou__ the carpet needs to be cleaned , and i want to paint the walls a different color . __eou__ an empty house is easier to paint and clean . take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in . __eou__ i want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house . __eou__ i think that will work out just fine . it will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold . __eou__ would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day i move in ? __eou__ my grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day .
hello , i was wondering if i could talk with the apartment manager . __eou__ i am the apartment manager . how can i help you ? __eou__ i was wondering if the apartment on main street is still available . __eou__ yes , it's still vacant . are you interested in seeing it ? __eou__ yes , i would love to see the apartment . __eou__ i will be at the apartment today at 6 __eou__ yes , i can be there at 6 . __eou__ great . i'll see you at 6 . do you know where it is ? __eou__ yes , i have a friend who lives in that neighborhood . __eou__ i'll be bringing an application form . __eou__ ok , should i bring anything with me ? __eou__ no . i might need to see your id card , but that's about it .
i came in to see how my home inspection went . __eou__ first of all , i need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . do you understand what i was doing there ? __eou__ i had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it . __eou__ i help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it . __eou__ the owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month . __eou__ sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . they may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken . __eou__ are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ? __eou__ the owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced . __eou__ did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ? __eou__ the house has a very outdated electrical system . many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe .
when can i move into my new house ? __eou__ the current owners will be moving out on tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on wednesday . __eou__ will the utilities be turned on ? __eou__ you need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name . __eou__ i really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned . __eou__ if i were you , i would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in . __eou__ i was thinking that i should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in . __eou__ that would be perfect . that way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . __eou__ can you help me on my move-in day ? __eou__ i think that i have something else really important to do on that day . i just can ’ t remember what it is .
so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? that refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ yes . i needed a large one . before , i had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . __eou__ that ’ s usual nowadays . you ’ ve added a few shelves too . __eou__ yes . you know i ’ ve been cooking more kind of food recently and i needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . __eou__ did you buy new cupboards too ? __eou__ no , i didn ’ t . i gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . the worktop was in poor condition , so i had a new one added . __eou__ i see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . __eou__ yes , i have . i need them to help me with these new dished i ’ m trying to make . i need a little more practice before i invite guests over .
i'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please . __eou__ this is he . what can i do for you ? __eou__ i'm interested in the apartment on main street . __eou__ it's still available . do you want to see it ? __eou__ yes , i would very much like to see it . __eou__ does today at 6 p . m . sound okay to you ? __eou__ i have no problem with 6 p . m . __eou__ okay , i'll see you at 6 o'clock . do you need any directions ? __eou__ no , thanks . i already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like . __eou__ i'll have an application form with me . you can fill it out if you're interested . __eou__ should i bring anything with me ? __eou__ no . i only need to check your driver's license .
can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? i don ’ t think i can finish everything in time . __eou__ ok , what do you want me to do ? __eou__ first of all , i need you to do the drying up . i ’ m almost finished the washing up . i ’ m going to clean the cooker when i finish . __eou__ ok . i ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as i dry them . where is the tea towel ? oh , here it is . __eou__ we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . __eou__ while you ’ re cleaning the cooker , i ’ ll wipe the worktop . that was a great meat , by the way . __eou__ actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . i made far too much food to eat alone . i am glad you could come over to help me finish it . __eou__ my pleasure ! this tea towel ’ s a little ragged . do you have another one ? __eou__ yes . look in that drawer . i should throw the old one out . __eou__ keep it and use it as rag . you can clean your bicycle with it .
i ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . i bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . what do you think of this ? __eou__ that looks good . the room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room . __eou__ i ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe . __eou__ you would fit both of them in your bedroom . perhaps you could also get the dressing table . i think that one would look good in your bedroom . __eou__ yes , it would . it ’ s very expensive though . __eou__ everything in this magazine seems expensive . you could probably find something similar in a discount store . __eou__ yes . i ’ m sure i could find something similar at one . i ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom . __eou__ you can get cheap carpets easily . another idea is to buy a rug . that would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . it would save you a lot of work . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . i ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom .
i have redecorated my bedroom . i decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . i also bought a new pair of curtains . what do you think of it ? __eou__ i think is looks great . i really like the light colors you have chosen . the pictures are nice too . did you bought any new furniture ? __eou__ i bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . i also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . __eou__ new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . i see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . __eou__ do you think that i should get a new wardrobe ? __eou__ that wardrobe looks quite big . is it full of clothes ? __eou__ yes . i have so many clothes stuffed into it . perhaps i should get rid of some of them . there are clothes in there that i never wear anymore . __eou__ i like to get rid of clothes that i don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . they take up too much space . there are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . they will be __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . after i get rid of the old clothes i no longer wear , i can see what new clothes i need to buy . __eou__ i need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . perhaps we can go together one day . __eou__ ok . i ’ ll let you know when i ’ ve sorted out my clothes .
the bathroom looks lovely . did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? __eou__ i did it myself . i went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . then i went to diy shop and bought everything i needed . i ’ m sure i saved a lot of money by doing it mys __eou__ so , let ’ s see . you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . you ’ ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . the bath , shower and waterbasin are the sam __eou__ yes , they are . i gave them a good clean . they are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . __eou__ how long did it take you to do the tiling . __eou__ as i hadn ’ t done it before , i had to keep referring to information i got from the internet . doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . the __eou__ i think you ’ ve done a very good job . as least as good as a professional would do . perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom ? __eou__ you ’ ll be lucky ! however , i ’ ll print out the information i got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? __eou__ we eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef.you eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , we do.we also eat a lot of lamb . __eou__ yes . i ’ ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops . __eou__ that ’ s right.they taste so good.we eat them with mint sauce.have you ever tried them ? __eou__ yes , i have . i tried them when i visited your country last year . i thought they were very tasty.can you cook them ? __eou__ i certainly can.if i can get some from the butchers , i ’ ll cook them for you . __eou__ that sounds great . i ’ ll boring a bottle of wine .
what do we need for the barbecue ? __eou__ well , i ’ ve bought a lot of meat . i ’ ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties . __eou__ i can ’ t wait to start cooking . i ’ ve bought the grill and charcoal.do you have enough plates and utensils ? __eou__ i think so . i bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.it will save on the washing up . __eou__ and if people drop them , they won ’ t break.we ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . __eou__ they sell them at the shop around the corner.we can go and get some in a few minutes . __eou__ i brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.we ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce . __eou__ i have the sauce , but remind me to get some catchup at the shop . __eou__ how long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ? __eou__ it only takes a few minutes.some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.the great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . __eou__ they can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it . __eou__ i hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians .
good morning . i understand that you ’ ve got a problem with your washing machine . i ’ m from the repair company . __eou__ excellent . come in please . the washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . it keeps breaking down . __eou__ when did it first break down ? __eou__ about ten days ago . i ’ ve tried to use it since then . sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating . __eou__ is it still under warranty . if it is and i can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . __eou__ yes , it ’ s still under warranty . over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high - pitch noise when it ’ s in use . __eou__ ok . i ’ ll start by looking at the motor . i ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . there ’ s the problem . it ’ s quite simple . i ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ part of the motor is loose . i can put it back in place quite easily . __eou__ that ’ s great . thanks very much . would you like a cup of tea or coffee ?
hi , you said that you might need some help with preparing dinner.what would you like me to do ? __eou__ thanks for coming over to help . i really appreciate it.first , could you peel the vegetables ? i ’ ve put them all in the sink and there is a peeler . __eou__ ok , i ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . i ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . i always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small.wow , you can chop vegetables really quickly __eou__ after you ’ ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? just use a very small amount of oil.fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it . __eou__ which spices are you going to add to the meat ? __eou__ these ones here.the one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add . __eou__ yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons.of water.ok , i ’ m really to do the meat.should i cook it over a low flame ? __eou__ cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly.keep stirring the meat around the frying pan.don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . __eou__ right.what are you doing over there ? __eou__ i ’ m mixing the sauce.it ’ s my speciality . i make it according to my own secret recipe .
mom , i hate eating vegetables ! __eou__ you don ’ t have to eat them . i don ’ t mind . __eou__ thanks , mom.can i have dessert now ? i love chocolate cake . __eou__ no dessert for you unless you eat all of your vegetables . __eou__ but i don ’ t like them.it ’ s not fair . __eou__ you can have some fruits for dessert.if you eat an apple and a banana , i might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . __eou__ ok , actually i don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots.but i hate broccoli and cauliflower . __eou__ i'll remember that for next time.you ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , but no broccoli or cauliflower , ok ? __eou__ thanks , mom !
what would you like for dessert ? __eou__ what do you have ? __eou__ i have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail . __eou__ can i have apple pie with ice cream ? __eou__ of course . i made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . __eou__ i love your home-made apple pie.it ’ s delicious.can i have another glass of lemonade as well ? __eou__ sure.can you get it yourself , it ’ s in the refrigerator . __eou__ ok.would you like a drink too ? __eou__ yes , i ’ ll have an ice tea.you see it next to the lemonade . __eou__ are you having any dessert ? __eou__ i ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . i have to watch my weight .
hey , jim . it's time to wake up and get out of bed . __eou__ do i have to get up now ? __eou__ you'd better get up , or you'll be late . __eou__ what're you talking about ? my alarm even hasn't gone off yet . __eou__ yes , it did . it went off thirty minutes ago . you slept right through it . you're like a dead person while you sleep . __eou__ i must have slept right through it . __eou__ rise and shine ! sleepyhead ! __eou__ just let me sleep five more minutes . __eou__ the early bird gets the worm . __eou__ i know , i know . but i don't want any worms . __eou__ ha ! ha ! if you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .

what kind of place shall we rent ? __eou__ it should be close to the university . neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . __eou__ absolutely . that's the most important thing to take into consideration . i'm not too worried about the size of the flat . __eou__ neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . do you mind if it's in a noisy area ? __eou__ i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . __eou__ good point . ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . __eou__ yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . __eou__ how much do you think the rent will be ? __eou__ i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .

what kind of a car do you have ? __eou__ an old one . __eou__ i know it's old , but what make is it ? __eou__ it's a chevrolet . why do you ask ? you going into the car business ? __eou__ nothing like that . my cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . it's practically new . __eou__ well i have been thinking about getting a newer car . i can't afford a brand new one . __eou__ would you like to look at my cousin's car ? __eou__ is it a four-door or a two-door ? __eou__ it's a coupe with a vinyl roof . __eou__ does it have automatic transmission ? . __eou__ yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning . __eou__ i guess i might take a look at it .
you're finally here ! what took so long ? __eou__ i got stuck in traffic again . there was a terrible traffic jam near the carrefour intersection . __eou__ it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . __eou__ i don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . __eou__ perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . __eou__ i think it's something that i'll have to consider . the public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ it would be better for the environment , too . __eou__ i know . i feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . __eou__ taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . __eou__ the only problem is that i'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . __eou__ well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . that will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . __eou__ that's true . i could certainly use the exercise ! __eou__ so , are you going to quit driving to work then ? __eou__ yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .

i like this apartment . do you think we can afford the mortgage ? __eou__ yes . i think so . it ’ s not a very expensive apartment . it ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . the rooms are quite large too . __eou__ i love the balcony . we can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . we are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . __eou__ the neighbourhood is nice too . there is a park nearby . __eou__ yes , and there are many houses nearby . i like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . __eou__ it ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . a garden would be so nice . __eou__ yes , it would . don ’ t worry . there ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . this place will be fine . __eou__ the building is quite new and well constructed . i ’ m happy with the fittings too . __eou__ yes , everything has been well designed .

is that your rabbit ? __eou__ yes , i just adopted her from the humane society this weekend . __eou__ that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . __eou__ well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , i wanted a pet that would be affectionate . __eou__ rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ? __eou__ if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats . __eou__ i didn't know that . are rabbits difficult to take care of ? __eou__ not really . i went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all i needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its __eou__ that sounds pretty easy . do rabbits make your house smell ? __eou__ no , rabbits aren't very stinky . as long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . __eou__ can you train a rabbit to do things ? __eou__ you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . for example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . __eou__ that's amazing ! has she bitten you yet ? __eou__ not yet . she's pretty tame . i think she must be used to being around lots of different people .
this bloody computer ! __eou__ what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! __eou__ what were you doing when it crashed ? __eou__ i was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery . __eou__ i think that might have been a virus . __eou__ oh , no ! i thought it seemed a bit strange . __eou__ what kind of computer do you have , a mac or a pc ? __eou__ it's a pc . doesn't everyone have a pc in this office ? __eou__ no , some people have macs now , too . __eou__ what's the difference ? __eou__ pcs often crash from virus , but it's nearly impossible to get a virus from a mac . __eou__ i didn't know that . __eou__ has your computer turned back on yet ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ did you end up losing any of your work ? __eou__ fortunately , i saved my work right before it crashed , so it should be ok . __eou__ you should probably call the it department and have them check your computer for virus . __eou__ that's a good idea . i'll call them now . thanks for your help !

what should i get uncle teddy ? __eou__ you could get him a tie . __eou__ are you kidding ? that's the stupidest gift one can buy . i don't want to get a tie . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ everybody gets men ties for christmas . it's too boring . everybody buys either ties or sweaters . i want a more unique gift . __eou__ well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . __eou__ that's a cool idea . at least it would be a surprise.but i'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . __eou__ he would think you were crazy , caroline . __eou__ yes . an iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.so i have to find something halfway between . __eou__ how much do you want to spend ? __eou__ well , he was very good to me.he helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.so i want to spend at least 75 dollars . __eou__ alright , i have an idea.you know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . __eou__ yes . __eou__ well , he isn't a lawyer , so i don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . __eou__ what should he have then ? __eou__ i think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.but more like a workbag or shoulder bag.you know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . __eou__ i think that's a great idea . men look great with that kind of bag.where can we buy one ? __eou__ i don't think this mall has a leather goods store.so we have to go to state street . __eou__ alright . we can go later then . __eou__ we can buy something for mom and dad here , and then go buy uncle teddy's gift on state street . __eou__ good plan . what should we get for mom though ? __eou__ she said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . i think they sell them at sears . __eou__ alright . we can go check at sears and see if they have them.and what about dad ? __eou__ how about the iguana ? __eou__ i think it would be a great joke.but i know we'd have to take the iguana back . and the pet store might not let us.so why don't we get him something else ? some clothes maybe . __eou__ a tie ? __eou__ oh , shut up about ties ! forget about ties , why not ? __eou__ i was just kidding .

i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . __eou__ we should plan to move out of here before july . i'm tired of living in apartments . __eou__ i know , dear . i am too . but we've just been too busy to look for a house . __eou__ we need to find a good realtor . __eou__ not necessarily . if we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ realtors always get a commission.if the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . __eou__ but doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles . __eou__ yes , that's often true . but you have to pay them . __eou__ i still think we should have a realtor.we ' re new in this country . we don't know all the laws of buying a house.and also , the realtor will inspect the house.he can tell us if the house has __eou__ of course we need a home inspector.but we can hire an inspector on our own.and as for the legal problems , i have friends . they can help us . __eou__ so how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ it takes a little more time . we have to check the ads in the paper.probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . __eou__ and doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? __eou__ sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . it's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . __eou__ why ? __eou__ because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.he will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ hmm . it all sounds very complicated . __eou__ it is . but buying a house is very important . so it takes time.that ' s why we haven't done it yet . it's very troublesome . __eou__ i want to look in the papers today . maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ alright . i'll buy a newspaper when i go to the drug store .
are you good at cooking ? __eou__ no , but i'm pretty good at eating ! __eou__ do you prefer chinese food or western food ? __eou__ well , to be honest with you , chinese food is really different from western food . __eou__ are you used to the food here ? __eou__ i'm not really used to it yet . __eou__ what's your favorite chinese dish ? __eou__ like most foreigners , i really like sweet and sour pork and kung pao chicken . i eat them almost every day . __eou__ have you tried traditional chinese dumplings yet ? __eou__ i tried once , but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks . __eou__ you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . if you do , you'll give your chinese friends quite an impression . __eou__ that's good to know . i'd like to try more chinese food , but since i can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it's difficult to try new food . __eou__ if you want , i can introduce you to some typical chinese dishes . __eou__ that would be great . i really only want to taste real chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat ! __eou__ if you haven't tried beijing duck yet , i'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near qianmen . it would be a pity if you left without tasting it !
albert and i need a lot of things to furnish our house.but i don't know where the best place to shop is . can you give me some advice ? __eou__ sure , carolyn . i'm happy to help you.what kinds of things do you need right now ? __eou__ well , we have most of the furniture already.we mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.and albert wants to set up a little off __eou__ well , as for albert , he should go to an office supply store.there ' s a very good one called office depot . they have everything he will need.and their prices are good too . it's very convey __eou__ can i write that down ? __eou__ sure , it's spelled office and then d - e - p - o - t.it ' s in the yellow pages . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ and as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ? __eou__ probably good prices . you know we will only be in america for about a year . __eou__ then i suggest you go to k-mart or wal-mart . __eou__ what are those stores ? __eou__ they are very large , discount department stores.that means their prices are very good.and you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom . __eou__ even silverware ? __eou__ yes , everything.they don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.the main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient . __eou__ i have a friend that said something about a place called price club.do you know about that ? __eou__ i have never shopped there , but i think price club is a kind of membership store . __eou__ what does that mean ? __eou__ that means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . i have heard they have very good prices on electronics . __eou__ electronics ? __eou__ yes . like stereos and televisions . __eou__ how much is the membership fee ? __eou__ i'm not sure.but if you are only going to stay a year , i don't think price club is good to join.they have great deals occasionally.they are very good for people who like to buy new things all __eou__ i see . thanks for these tips . we really need to buy a lot of little things . __eou__ i know how it is . moving is very troublesome .
may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i would like to return these slacks . __eou__ alright . do you have your receipt ? __eou__ yes . here it is . i bought them last week . __eou__ and why are you returning them ? __eou__ i bought them to go with a blouse of mine . but they don't really match . __eou__ i see . oh , wait . ma'am , i'm sorry . these slacks were on sale . __eou__ yes , they were thirty percent off . __eou__ i'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . __eou__ i know many stores have that policy . but i have returned sale items here before . __eou__ i'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . it is our policy . __eou__ i just bought these slacks a week ago . and i am a regular customer here.can you make an exception this time ? __eou__ well . let me talk to the manager for a moment.ma ' am , the manager says i can do it this time . __eou__ good . i'm a regular customer here . i am glad you can make an exception for me . __eou__ please show me your receipt again . __eou__ here it is . __eou__ i will have to give you store credit , ma'am . if you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit . __eou__ store credit is okay with me . i'm sure i will find something i like . i shop here a lot . __eou__ we appreciate your business , ma'am .
morgan , can i ask you a question ? __eou__ sure , what is it ? __eou__ i was just wondering if many chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant . __eou__ in most cities in china , doggie bags are quite uncommon . __eou__ what happen to all the leftover food ? __eou__ it usually goes to the dump . __eou__ that seems like an awful waste ! why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? __eou__ ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in china . you know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today . __eou__ i guess that makes sense . i just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home . __eou__ well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home . __eou__ no , that's ok . you know what they say when in rome ... __eou__ i was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . i heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them . __eou__ many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so i think they are ok . __eou__ did you like them ? you could take the last one home with you . __eou__ that's ok . i'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough !
do you like cooking , julia ? __eou__ i really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! __eou__ how often do you usually cook ? __eou__ i usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and i make dinner about 6 times a week . __eou__ that's a lot of cooking . you must save a lot of money by eating at home so much . __eou__ i do . if you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . __eou__ what kind of dishes do you usually make ? __eou__ i almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on sundays . __eou__ do you make a lot of traditional british food ? __eou__ aside from the sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . __eou__ how about spicy food ? __eou__ my family loves spicy food . we often eat chinese , thai , indian , or mexican food when we're in the mood for spice . __eou__ what's your favorite dish to make ? __eou__ i absolutely love making mousaka , which is a greek dish with eggplant . but it takes a lot of time , so i don ’ t often make it .
i'm so tired ! i don't know how i'm going to make it through this lecture . __eou__ the professor is a bit boring today . you need something to perk yourself up . how about a coffee ? __eou__ i don't really like coffee , to be honest . it's too bitter for me . __eou__ well , you need something to wake you up . how about a soda ? __eou__ most some drinks have too much sugar in them . __eou__ the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ? __eou__ i like diet sprite . does that have any caffeine in it ? __eou__ unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? __eou__ i don't care for coke . i heard that coke was first used as a medicine and i don't like medicine . what else has caffeine ? __eou__ maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . __eou__ maybe . how about a mochaccino ? are they any good ? __eou__ you'll love that . it's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . __eou__ that's perfect ! would you like one , too ? my treat . __eou__ thanks , but i'll stick with some jasmine tea . i'm trying to watch my diet .
do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? __eou__ no , i was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . how about you ? __eou__ i was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . what do you think ? __eou__ i'm absolutely useless at cooking ! __eou__ i could teach you how to cook something healthy . frozen pizza are so bad for you ! __eou__ i know they aren't good for me , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty . __eou__ i recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . maybe we could try that ? __eou__ yeah , why not . do you have all the ingredients ? __eou__ i bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! __eou__ what do we do first ? __eou__ first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . __eou__ ok . should i heat the wok ? __eou__ yes . once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . __eou__ what about the chicken ? __eou__ that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . __eou__ how about the rice ? __eou__ i'll prepare it . do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? __eou__ white rice , please . none of that healthy brown stuff for me !
are you ready for your first driving lesson ? __eou__ yes . which one is the brake again ? __eou__ the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . __eou__ i ’ m glad this car is an automatic . i don't like having to change gears . __eou__ automatics are very simple to drive . the first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . __eou__ you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! __eou__ very funny . next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . can you see out of them ? __eou__ i can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . could you move it forward a bit , please ? __eou__ how ’ s that ? __eou__ that ’ s better . now what ? __eou__ check your petrol situation . __eou__ the tank is almost empty . i guess i ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . __eou__ i got it . don ’ t worry . i ’ ll get you there in one piece . __eou__ remember , no honking this time . the horn is only for emergencies ! __eou__ why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ?
hoo , i'm getting tired , jeanine , been a long day . __eou__ i'm not quitting yet . you know my favourite slogan , don't you ? __eou__ yeah , i know . shop till you drop . __eou__ right ! __eou__ i'm getting a little short on cash . let's just window shop a little . __eou__ ok . __eou__ hey , jeanine , get a load of that . it's beautiful . __eou__ ahahah , and i thought you were tired . __eou__ you know .. i have a weakness for long dresses . __eou__ it sure looks special , looks expensive too . __eou__ sure does . hey , can i sponge a little cash of you ? __eou__ don't worry , marian , i've got you covered . __eou__ thanks , jeanine , you are a real pal . let's go in .
hello , do you remember me ? i bought some vases from you yesterday . __eou__ yes , you sent them to new york , right ? __eou__ that's right . i thought i'd come back to buy some more souvenirs . __eou__ what did you in mind ? __eou__ well , first , i'd like to buy a few postcards . my sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . i want to do that , too . __eou__ we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . the same designs can be found on these posters . __eou__ posters are difficult to travel with . i think i'll just buy the postcards . i heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in venice . __eou__ yes , we do . they're on the wall behind you . __eou__ how much do they cost ? __eou__ the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? __eou__ yes , i think i'd like the green mask in the middle . __eou__ here you go . __eou__ i'll take it , i'd also like to buy some chocolate . __eou__ are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift . __eou__ yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate . __eou__ we've got plenty to choose from here . __eou__ they look delicious . i think she'll be pleased .
come on , let's go for lunch , gregory . __eou__ i was going to eat in , i'm short on cash . __eou__ don't worry about it.it ' s on me . __eou__ in that case , i'm with you . em.this is good . __eou__ i agreed , hi , guess what ? i went bungee jumping last weekend . __eou__ are you on the up and up ? __eou__ definitely . you know , i'm into serious sport in a big way . __eou__ if you asked me , you've got a screw loose somewhere . __eou__ come off it , it's not that serious . you should diy ( do it yourself ) sometime . __eou__ fat chance , i'm too scared of bungee jumping . __eou__ no , really , i think you'd like it . i adapted to it right off the bat . __eou__ what did that have to do with me ? i'm not the self-seeker like you . __eou__ i can teach you how . __eou__ i had a sneaking suspicion about you , eric , i think you've lost it . __eou__ no , not really , but i think i have lost my wallet . where can it be ?
hi , nally , are you hungry ? __eou__ i'm starving . let's go grab a bite . __eou__ where to ? __eou__ how about karlis ? __eou__ are you kidding ? that place is too ritzy for lunch . __eou__ true . ok let's go to grumose ? __eou__ same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . __eou__ i guess it is a little pricy . __eou__ let's stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch .. __eou__ that will be ok . come on , i can't wait to chow down . __eou__ that was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . __eou__ is that why you stiffed the waiter ? __eou__ you got it . all right , let's go back to school .
wow , amy , look at that number . __eou__ what's so great about it ? __eou__ what do you mean ? it's a scrim . __eou__ not to me , i wouldn't be caught dead in that . __eou__ i love that kind of stuff . __eou__ yeah , you seem to like those styles . __eou__ sure do . i get a kick out of looking punk . __eou__ this one looks really expensive though . __eou__ i don't care how much it costs . i'm rolling in it . __eou__ lucky you ! i can't buy anything else . i'm flat broke . __eou__ i got a replace my party outfit , i trashed it last week . __eou__ why did you drag me into this ? i've spent a week salary . __eou__ are you on the level ? you're the one who called me , remember ? __eou__ just joking , tonia . i've got some wonderful clothes . let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
excuse me , could you tell me which line i ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? __eou__ you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . __eou__ that ’ s a really long line . how long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? __eou__ it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait . __eou__ can i buy stamps here ? __eou__ sure . how many would you like ? __eou__ i need 30 for my christmas cards . __eou__ are you sending them abroad ? __eou__ twenty of them are going abroad to china and america . __eou__ do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do , those are less expensive . __eou__ no . __eou__ ok , here you go . that will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence . __eou__ and the bubble wrap ? __eou__ that ’ s another quid . __eou__ thanks a lot . you ’ ve been very helpful .
how can i help you ? __eou__ i'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend . __eou__ do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? __eou__ she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of chanel no . 5 . but i'd like to buy her a new fragrance . __eou__ ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes . __eou__ which one would you recommend ? __eou__ personally , i quite like the new perfume by clinique . it's a subtle flowery scent . what do you think ? __eou__ that smells great . i'll take one bottle , please . __eou__ would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? we have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . __eou__ it's ok . she normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and i wouldn't know what shade to buy . __eou__ how about some lipstick ? every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick . __eou__ she doesn't usually wear lipstick . she thinks it makes her nose look too big . __eou__ how about some mascara ? that will make her eyes look bigger . __eou__ no thank you . she has big enough eyes as it is . __eou__ i know what she would like---some whitening cream . __eou__ no thanks . western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter . __eou__ will that be all then ? __eou__ that will be all . you're been very helpful , thanks .
we really were lucky . we got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! did you see the long lines behind us ? __eou__ yeah , i'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . i'm starving ! __eou__ let's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? __eou__ what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? __eou__ i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . __eou__ well , let's get a plate of those then . __eou__ sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ? __eou__ i think i might have a dahl . __eou__ what's in a dahl ? __eou__ it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . __eou__ that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ? __eou__ ok . how about some lamb kebabs ? __eou__ that's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ? __eou__ i think i'll have a beer . __eou__ ok , shall i flag down the waitress ? __eou__ i wouldn't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round . __eou__ you're right . that might seem a bit rude . it's a good thing i've got you with me ! __eou__ what would you do without me ?
can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? i'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding . __eou__ sure . what kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ? __eou__ it depends on the price , but i was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend . __eou__ that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . what color do you want the suit to be ? __eou__ i was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit . __eou__ brown , huh ? isn't that a bit dull ? __eou__ haven't you heard ? brown is the new black . __eou__ why don't you just get black ? black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! __eou__ that may be true , but black is so boring . anyway , i already have three black suits . i might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest . __eou__ here are two different shades of brown . which one do you prefer ? __eou__ i like the one on the left , but i don't like the pattern on it . it's too much . i want a pattern that's a bit subtler . __eou__ how about this one ? __eou__ i think that will do . let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . __eou__ ok , let's go .
alright , tell me what you think . __eou__ don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? __eou__ yeah , maybe you ’ re right . how about this outfit ? __eou__ that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? __eou__ no , i don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but i love the way it looks . i just had to try it on ! what do you think about this ? it ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . __eou__ i like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . it ’ s too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? __eou__ that might be going overboard a bit . how about just that scarf with a bracelet ? __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . you have a lot of good fashion sense . __eou__ thanks . you ’ d be ok on your own . there are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . have you tried it on yet ? __eou__ yep . here it is . what do you think ? __eou__ that looks great . just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? __eou__ the leopard print sounds fabulous . are they a name brand ? __eou__ no , they ’ re a prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . __eou__ that ’ s even better than the real thing . __eou__ if i were you , i ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . if you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . __eou__ it ’ s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday !
it ’ s so great to be here ! i ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! __eou__ we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . would you like a tour of the house ? __eou__ that ’ d be great , but could i have a cup of tea first ? __eou__ sure , i ’ ll just go put the kettle on . why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and i ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen . __eou__ that would be lovely , thanks . __eou__ do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? __eou__ i ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup . __eou__ ok . what do you think about our living room ? __eou__ well , i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but i don ’ t really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient . __eou__ my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . __eou__ oh dear . well , i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here . __eou__ your daughter usually does the dusting , and i do the vacuuming . __eou__ i see . well , i can help with the chores while i ’ m here . you two could probably use my help . __eou__ that ’ s very nice of you to offer . here ’ s your tea . be careful , it ’ s still quite hot .
how is your house hunting going ? __eou__ not very well . i haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . __eou__ how much are you looking to spend ? __eou__ i can only afford about 300 pounds a month . __eou__ looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . __eou__ really ? that ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . __eou__ well , if you want to live in london , you have to pay the price ! __eou__ do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? __eou__ i can ask around at work . do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? __eou__ i ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but i guess i ’ ll have to take what i can get ! __eou__ how long do you want to sign a contract for ? __eou__ i can sign a contract up to a year . i don ’ t know where i ’ ll be after that . __eou__ do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? __eou__ i don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . __eou__ you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? __eou__ no , i thought that would be included in the rent . __eou__ it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . __eou__ i don't think i can afford that . __eou__ don ’ t worry . sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children . __eou__ that's a good idea . i ’ ll look into finding something like that .
no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . i want to repay the favor . __eou__ no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time ! __eou__ oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count ! __eou__ ok , ok , how about we just go dutch ? it's settled . listen , i'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ? __eou__ ok ... sure .
how much is this ? __eou__ you mean the large one or the small one ? __eou__ the large one . __eou__ they're on special this week . they've been reduced to five dollars . __eou__ is this the only kind you have ? __eou__ no . we have some that are different in style but not in color . they're over there . do you see the sign ? __eou__ oh , yes . i think i'll look at those over there before i decide . __eou__ very well . just take your time .
ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ? __eou__ i'm really sorry , ethan . i tried so hard , but i'm afraid i could't find a dutch restaurant in town . the best i could do was a german one about 15 minutes from here . __eou__ what ? i don't understand . __eou__ i though you said you wanted to have dutch food ? __eou__ oh ! ha-ha ! that's not what i mean when i said ' go dutch ' ! __eou__ huh ? what were you talking about , then ? __eou__ ' going dutch ' means to split the bill , silly ! __eou__ oath ... that makes so much more sense ! ha-ha . well , great , i don't like german food anyway !
broadway mall is having a big sale this weekend . you wanna go ? __eou__ don't feel like it . i'm broke . __eou__ well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? __eou__ just look around ? ah , that's boring . __eou__ i'll go myself then .
how can i get to lakeside park ? __eou__ take the no . 7 bus . there's a bus stop just over there . __eou__ will it take me straight there ? __eou__ yes . no need to change .
hello . excuse me . do you know if there's a commercial bank around here ? __eou__ yes , go straight along beijing road and turn right . __eou__ straight on , and turn right . is it far ? __eou__ no , it's just a couple of minutes . __eou__ thanks very much . __eou__ you're welcome .
have you thought of moving at all sarah ? __eou__ we ’ ve thought about it , but my husband and i can ’ t afford it right now . the only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something i don ’ t want to do . __eou__ buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . you ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . do you know anyone who has done that before ? __eou__ sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . they ’ re pretty satisfied with it . __eou__ is the house pretty run-down . __eou__ not at all . the woman , who owned it , took good care of it . but when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . __eou__ was it very old house ? __eou__ it was about 75 years old . there were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . __eou__ is it in a good location ? __eou__ the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok .
it ’ s such a nice day outside . let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . __eou__ you know i hate shopping more than anything else in this world . __eou__ i know . but we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . __eou__ what kind of errands do we need to run ? __eou__ well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor . __eou__ i ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . __eou__ fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . __eou__ sounds good . you have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . i know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . __eou__ i promise . we ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . __eou__ ok , let ’ s go then ! __eou__ do you have any money ? __eou__ for what ? __eou__ for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . __eou__ you said you were only going to window shop ! __eou__ i agreed to not go into the mall , but i can still look at things in the market ! __eou__ i should have known ...
mon and i got in another fight , boris . __eou__ oh , iris ! what was it about this time ? __eou__ it was over food . i simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no . __eou__ i believe she was right . you must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat . __eou__ oh , she keeps saying that . she never allows me to have them . __eou__ i think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth . __eou__ but , boris , i am not a baby any more . __eou__ well , that's true . __eou__ how about your mother ? __eou__ she also believes in healthy diet . and she requires us to have regular meals . __eou__ poor you . it seems we are in the same boat . __eou__ oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit . __eou__ really ? so you don't have fried food at all . __eou__ not really . i may have some occasionally for a chance . but i don't indulge myself too much . __eou__ how do you manage it ? __eou__ it's pretty simple , iris . just keep it in mind that you're what you eat .
what shall we do after the volleyball match ? __eou__ how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym . __eou__ that's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . __eou__ me , too . what did you have in mind ? __eou__ i haven't decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must . __eou__ i agree . they're very lovely , especially " huan huan " . __eou__ is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ? __eou__ the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive . __eou__ oh , i see . if i buy more than a set , can i get any discount ? __eou__ i don't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now . __eou__ any other ideas ? __eou__ there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . __eou__ it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i can't wait to see what they have .
good afternoon ! can i help you ? __eou__ could you show me where the chinese-style clothing is located ? i want to buy a silk coat . __eou__ this way , please . here they are . they're all handmade . __eou__ oh , they look nice . may i try that back one on ? __eou__ of course . the fitting room is right over there . __eou__ do you have a medium in the same color ? this one is a little tight . __eou__ i'm sorry . all the back of that size are sold out . would you like a red one ? __eou__ ok , let me try it on . what do you think ? __eou__ oh , that suits you very well . besides it is believed in china that the red color brings happiness and good luck . __eou__ really ? i'll take it , and i'm leaving here tomorrow . is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ? __eou__ our pleasure . please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number . __eou__ thanks . who much would that come to ? __eou__ let me see ...
boris , look at this sentence . " healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " it's interesting , isn't it ? __eou__ i'd rather say it's confusing . what are those " strict nutrition philosophies " about ? __eou__ i believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . __eou__ probably , iris . that must be the job of nutritionists . __eou__ healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . so we are free to have whatever foods we love . it is unbelievable . __eou__ oh , believe it or not , i came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . __eou__ seriously ? __eou__ yes , i felt exactly the same way as you did just now . scientists must be crazy in saying so . __eou__ maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet . __eou__ absolutely . i myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . as long as i have enough energy , it's fine . __eou__ but one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body .
i'm so hungry . shall we go eat now , rick ? __eou__ sure . where do you want to go ? are you in the mood for anything in particular ? __eou__ how about some dumplings ? i just can't get enough of them . __eou__ dumplings again ? ! oh , amy , let's try something new ! __eou__ well , what do you have in mind ? __eou__ how about the mongolian hot pot ? __eou__ oh , it's too spicy for me . don't you remember last time when i tasted the lamb ? it was so spicy my eyes teared up ! __eou__ maybe we can try yuanyang pot this time . you can choose the non-spicy soup base . __eou__ sounds great . do they serve noodles ? i am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . __eou__ yes . the sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic shanti cuisines . __eou__ great . let's go ! __eou__ wait a minute . let me throw on a sweater .
wow , the duck looks so delicious . should we order it , rick ? __eou__ the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . there will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each . __eou__ i see . the chef is so skillful with his knife . __eou__ absolutely . it is said that they serve 3,000 ducks every day . __eou__ incredible . by the way , what are these in the plates ? __eou__ oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . i will show you how to make one . __eou__ thank you . i couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . __eou__ just roll it up and have a bite , amy . __eou__ oh , it's terrific . i love the floor . can you tell me how it was prepared ? __eou__ certainly . first , a beijing duck is specially selected . after it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique __eou__ it sounds really complicated . no wonder it tastes so great . __eou__ yes , amy , please have some more .
what's wrong , officer ? __eou__ you do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ? __eou__ i did ? __eou__ you didn't see the red light ? __eou__ i'm sorry for running it , but i really didn't know . __eou__ didn't you learn that red means stop ? __eou__ i know that . __eou__ then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light . __eou__ i'm not sure . __eou__ i'm giving you a ticket for this . __eou__ i'm sorry for the misunderstanding . __eou__ maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .

i'd like to have internet on my computer . __eou__ do you know what kind of internet you would like to get ? __eou__ what are my options ? __eou__ you can either get dial-up or del . __eou__ which one would you recommend ? __eou__ del is the best choice . __eou__ why is del better ? __eou__ it's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line . __eou__ what exactly does that mean ? __eou__ well , with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line . __eou__ that means that i can't use my phone and the internet at the same time , right ? __eou__ that's right . you won't have that problem with del .
it's time for you to wake up . __eou__ give me five more minutes . i'm really tired this morning . __eou__ i'm sorry , but it's time for you to get ready for school . __eou__ i get that , but let me just sleep for a little bit longer . __eou__ you're not going to get up in five minutes if i let you fall back asleep . __eou__ believe me . i will get up and get ready in five minutes . __eou__ there's a lot that you need to do this morning . __eou__ i understand , and it will get done after i wake up in five minutes . __eou__ i would like for you to not be late for school . __eou__ i'm going to be on time today . __eou__ go back to sleep then , but only five more minutes . __eou__ thanks a lot .
i need to get internet . __eou__ which kind of internet connection do you want to get ? __eou__ what kind can i get ? __eou__ there is dial-up or del . __eou__ which one do you feel is best ? __eou__ i would get del if i were you . __eou__ del is better than dial-up ? __eou__ it's the best choice ; plus , it won't tie up your phone line . __eou__ i'm not sure what that means . __eou__ dial-up is connected through your phone , unlike del . __eou__ that'll make it impossible for me to use . __eou__ exactly . with del you don't have that problem .
wake up , it's time for school . __eou__ i'm so tired . let me sleep for five more minutes . __eou__ you have to get up and get ready for school . __eou__ i know , but just five more minutes . __eou__ i can't let you go back to sleep , because you won't wake back up . __eou__ i promise i'll wake up , in five minutes . __eou__ you still need to eat breakfast , take a shower , and get dressed . __eou__ i realize that , and i can do all that when i wake up in five minutes . __eou__ i don't want you to be late for school today . __eou__ i'm not going to be late today . __eou__ fine , five more minutes . __eou__ thank you .
it's time for bed . __eou__ i'm not ready to go to sleep . i'm not tired . __eou__ it's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . __eou__ i'm not going to be able to fall asleep . __eou__ why don't you try counting sheep ? __eou__ i've tried that before . it really doesn't work . __eou__ that's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . __eou__ why can't i just stay up until i fall asleep ? __eou__ if i let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . __eou__ i promise i'll go to sleep soon . __eou__ no , you're going to sleep now , so good night . __eou__ see you in the morning .
shouldn't you already be in bed ? __eou__ i can't sleep . i'm really not all that tired . __eou__ you need to get some rest , as you have to get up early in the morning . __eou__ it's impossible for me to get to sleep right now . __eou__ just close your eyes , and try not to think . __eou__ that really does not work for me . __eou__ it doesn't matter , you need to get some sleep . __eou__ how about i tire myself out , and then fall asleep when i'm tired ? __eou__ then you're not going to go to sleep . __eou__ don't worry , i'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while . __eou__ i want you in bed , right now , so sweet dreams . __eou__ fine . sleep well yourself .
hey man , you hit my car . __eou__ i really didn't mean to . __eou__ it doesn't matter , because you damaged my car . __eou__ it looks okay to me . __eou__ look what you did to my rear bumper . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ my bumper is smashed in . __eou__ i didn't do that . __eou__ your front bumper is just as damaged . __eou__ if you'd just give me your number and insurance , then i'll handle it . __eou__ here . i'd better get a call from you . __eou__ don't worry .
you ran into my car . __eou__ that was my fault . i'm sorry . __eou__ you messed up my car . __eou__ i don't see any damage . __eou__ my rear bumper is messed up . __eou__ i don't see anything wrong with it . __eou__ it's smashed in . __eou__ that's not my fault . __eou__ the same thing is wrong with your bumper . __eou__ i'll take care of everything . i just need your phone number and insurance . __eou__ i need your information too . __eou__ here you go .

what's up , officer ? __eou__ are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ? __eou__ there was a stop sign ? __eou__ how could you not notice it ? __eou__ if there really was a stop sign , i couldn't see it because of the overgrown bushes . __eou__ you know.you ' re right . the bushes are covering the sign . __eou__ if i saw the stop sign , i would've stopped for it . __eou__ now that i think about it , i can see how you missed it . __eou__ am i getting a ticket for this ? __eou__ i'll let you off with a warning . __eou__ thank you , i really do appreciate that . __eou__ don't worry about it . i need to have something done about those bushes .
what's the problem ? __eou__ there was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for . __eou__ i really didn't see it . __eou__ how'd you miss it ? __eou__ i only saw bushes at the intersection . __eou__ those bushes are covering the stop sign . __eou__ i really didn't mean to run it . __eou__ i see why you didn't stop . __eou__ are you still going to write me a ticket ? __eou__ no , i'm just going to let you go . __eou__ thanks for being so understanding . __eou__ that's all right . make sure to look closely next time .
why'd you pull me over ? __eou__ are you aware that you drove through a red light ? __eou__ i ran a red light ? __eou__ yes , you did . __eou__ i apologize , but i didn't realize that i did . __eou__ weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ? __eou__ i did learn that . __eou__ so , then why did you speed up ? __eou__ i don't know what to tell you . __eou__ i'm going to have to write you a ticket . __eou__ i understand . __eou__ here you go . don't do that again .

hello , i'm returning your phone call . __eou__ i'm glad that you could get back to me so fast . __eou__ no problem , but what were you calling about ? __eou__ i needed to talk to you about your son . __eou__ is he messing up in school ? __eou__ he was acting up in class one day last week . __eou__ what was he doing ? __eou__ he wouldn't stop talking throughout the class . __eou__ i don't know what's gotten into him . __eou__ if you could , would you please talk to him ? __eou__ i will get right on that , and i am very sorry . __eou__ i really appreciate your help .
i have never done this before and don ’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house . __eou__ leave the details of making the offer up to me . what were you thinking you should offer ? __eou__ i absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more . __eou__ it is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer . how about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ? __eou__ i hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer . __eou__ your offering price is not out-of-line . the owners will either take it or make a counter-offer . __eou__ does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance ? __eou__ it usually doesn ’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer . __eou__ should i be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready ? __eou__ the only thing you should do now is relax . you already are pre-qualified for your loan .
did you call me ? __eou__ thank you for returning my call . __eou__ what was your call about ? __eou__ i wanted to have a talk with you about your son . __eou__ what did he do ? __eou__ he was messing around last week in class . __eou__ exactly what did he do ? __eou__ even though i asked him not to , he kept speaking out in class . __eou__ i don't know what his problem is . __eou__ i need you to talk to him , if you don't mind . __eou__ that won't happen again , i'm sorry . __eou__ thank you . hopefully i won't have to call about him again .
have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their home yet ? __eou__ the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . __eou__ should i accept their offer ? __eou__ there are two ways to respond . you can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer . __eou__ what if i make another offer , and they don ’ t accept it ? __eou__ no one else has made an offer , so you could make another offer if you want to do so . __eou__ i think that i would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . __eou__ ok , i will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight . __eou__ how long before i find out what their decision is ? __eou__ by now , the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept . it will go quickly .
i believe that you called me ? __eou__ oh , hi . thanks for getting back to me quickly . __eou__ why did you call me ? __eou__ i was calling about your son . __eou__ did he do something wrong ? __eou__ your son was acting up in class . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ he was talking and causing a disturbance during class . __eou__ that's really not like him . __eou__ if you could just talk to him , i would greatly appreciate it . __eou__ i apologize , and i'll make sure he doesn't do that again . __eou__ don't worry about it , but thank you very much .
have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ? __eou__ in response to your offer , the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . __eou__ that sounds pretty good to me , but i am not sure what to do . __eou__ you can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer . __eou__ if i make another offer and they refuse , then what ? __eou__ personally , i would consider making one more offer , but it is up to you to decide what to do . __eou__ let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer . __eou__ i will contact the sellers with your current offer . __eou__ do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ? __eou__ usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one .
why'd you run into me ? __eou__ i didn't mean to . it was an accident . __eou__ you have completely damaged my car . __eou__ i did not . it looks perfectly fine . __eou__ you don't see what happened to my bumper ? __eou__ what did i do to it ? __eou__ you smashed my bumper in with your car . __eou__ i really don't think that i did that . __eou__ your bumper looks exactly the same . __eou__ look , just give me your insurance and number and i'll take care of it . __eou__ give me your information , in case i don't hear from you . __eou__ trust me .
i was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . __eou__ i was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk . __eou__ did they go with the proposed counter-offer ? __eou__ they want you to pick up the cost of the home inspection , but they accepted your offer . __eou__ is a home inspection very expensive ? __eou__ it can cost between five hundred and one thousand dollars . __eou__ do i get to choose who inspects the home ? __eou__ yes , you get to choose . i would spend a little more to get a really thorough inspection . __eou__ can you call the owners with my acceptance right away ? __eou__ i am going to contact the sellers immediately . they were looking forward to your acceptance .
i want to take a look at that home with the open house flags out front . __eou__ what a wonderful neighborhood ! can you find that house on our open house list ? __eou__ yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list . __eou__ they always make the front yards look so great for open houses . let ’ s see what the inside looks like . __eou__ i am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here . __eou__ signing the registry is a good idea . i think i want to see the kitchen next . __eou__ i really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day . __eou__ i need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it . __eou__ is the current asking price listed on the flyer ? __eou__ the asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars .
may i help you ? __eou__ i needed to ask you a question . __eou__ ask away . __eou__ how many hours of the behind-the-wheel course do i need to take ? __eou__ why do you need to take the course ? __eou__ i want to get my license . __eou__ you have to do six hours behind the wheel . __eou__ how many days do i need to finish the course ? __eou__ you can't finish in less than three days . __eou__ is that all ? __eou__ there's nothing else to it . __eou__ that sounds easy enough .
what do you need today ? __eou__ i need to take a few classes . __eou__ what kind of classes would you like to take ? __eou__ how about a driver's course ? __eou__ okay , you're going to need to make an appointment . __eou__ i don't understand why i need to make an appointment . __eou__ you need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork . __eou__ i'd like to make one now if i could . __eou__ sure you can ; when would you like to come in ? __eou__ i'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9 __eou__ that'll be fine . __eou__ that's great . thank you very much .

from the looks of this house from the outside , i don ’ t really think that i want to go inside . __eou__ from here , it does look like it could use a little work . let ’ s see what the interior looks like . __eou__ i am not impressed by the interior of this house . __eou__ sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint . __eou__ with so few windows , how can you even see what the problems are ? __eou__ i think that we should check out the kitchen . it is listed as roomy and spacious . __eou__ where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space ? __eou__ the picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite . i think that we should go look at it since we are here . __eou__ is there a dead animal somewhere in here ? __eou__ well , i think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you .
were you able to contact the owners about my counter-offer ? __eou__ yes , please have a seat , and we ’ ll discuss this right now . __eou__ i hope that they accepted the counter-offer . __eou__ the counter-offer was acceptable to them , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . __eou__ will the home inspection cost me a lot ? __eou__ it can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand dollars . __eou__ is it my choice as to who inspects this house ? __eou__ yes , it is your choice as you are paying for it . make a wise investment and choose the best inspector you can find . __eou__ how long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ? __eou__ let ’ s call them right now . i am sure that they will be happy to hear that you have agreed to pay for the inspection .

i want to go house shopping , and i want to know what i can afford to buy . __eou__ there is a formula that can help us figure that out . what is your annual salary ? __eou__ i earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year . __eou__ what is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ? __eou__ i have been at the job i now have for 2 years , and i have been with the company for 6 years total . __eou__ do you receive any other income ? __eou__ i own a small rental unit with a partner , and i receive five hundred dollars a month from that unit . __eou__ do you know what your credit score is ? __eou__ i don ’ t know , but the last time i checked , it was very good ! __eou__ you are in good shape . figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more !

can we choose a time to look at houses together ? __eou__ can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? __eou__ either way is good for me . __eou__ there are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . would that okay with you ? __eou__ i can take a little time off of work , or i can go on a weekend , also . __eou__ we could meet at the real estate office , or i could pick you up at your home . __eou__ i am leaving from work , so maybe i could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . __eou__ i can think of five houses that we should look at . it will take most of the day . __eou__ i would like to see as many as possible . __eou__ when i have confirmed the times with the owners , i will e-mail you our plans for the day .

why do you look so gloomy ? what are you looking for ? __eou__ my dissertation . i put it somewhere last night and i can't find it now . __eou__ did you finish typing it yesterday ? __eou__ yes , i kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . __eou__ don't worry about it . it must be somewhere in your room . let's see where you put it . have you searched your drawers and the desk ? __eou__ yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . __eou__ how about the shelf ? __eou__ i've searched everywhere . where on earth did i put it ? __eou__ don't get upset over it . at least you have another week to go . __eou__ i have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . how could i do such a thing ? __eou__ cheer up ! what i meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . there is no need to write a new one . oh , what's this ? is this your dissertation ? __eou__ let me see . yes , that's it . where did you find it ? __eou__ you ’ ve put it among these journals . __eou__ my poor memory . thank you very much .
the final examination will be held at the end of this month . have you made good preparation ? __eou__ sure . i've reviewed all the lessons i have learned this academic year . __eou__ are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ i am 100 % certain . __eou__ according to what you did last time , i have my doubts . __eou__ i am sure i can get a 95 this time .
did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? __eou__ yes , just once . __eou__ what was the reason ? __eou__ i once played truant when i was in college because i intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in sichuan .
uh-oh . i'm in trouble . __eou__ why ? what's wrong ? __eou__ i just remembered that i've got to give a speech in class today and i forgot to prepare for it . __eou__ i guess you'll have to wing it .
hi ! ed , what's up ? __eou__ nothing . __eou__ doesn't look like it to me . __eou__ just get out of my face ! __eou__ woo , easy . __eou__ leave me alone ! __eou__ what are you so ticked off about ? __eou__ i don't want to talk about it . __eou__ maybe i can help . __eou__ i blew the finally exam . __eou__ you've got to be joking . __eou__ no , i'm not . __eou__ well , don't get bend on a ship about it .
excuse me . can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? __eou__ sure . you see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ these drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . you can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . fox example , this drawer goes from sca to scm . __eou__ so if i'm looking for a look called a history of western society , i'd just look under ' a ' . __eou__ no . you'd look under ' w ' . the articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . __eou__ what if i don't know the title of the book ? __eou__ well , you can look under the author's name . __eou__ could you give me an example ? __eou__ suppose you want to find a book by your professor , william smith . you'd look under smith and then william . since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' william smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in .
i hear that the students ' union is going to take new members . __eou__ really ? can i join it ? __eou__ of course you can if you like it . __eou__ how can i join it ? __eou__ there will be an information session about the students ' union this tuesday . you can apply for it then . __eou__ ok , thank you .
is that mr . green ? __eou__ this is him speaking . __eou__ i am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . welcome aboard , i'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . __eou__ yes . i am very glad to have the chance .
excuse me . mr . li . may i ask you some questions ? __eou__ sure . take a seat , please . what would you like to know ? __eou__ can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a bachelor's degree ? __eou__ a bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses . __eou__ how long does it take to earn a bachelor's degree ? __eou__ normally it can be completed in four years .
jenny , you look terrible . what's eating you ? __eou__ don't brother me ! __eou__ hey , chill out , i'm just trying to help . __eou__ sorry , sally , it's not your fault . __eou__ so , what's the problem ? __eou__ i drew a blank on the algebra test . __eou__ no kidding ! didn't you study for it ? __eou__ yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . __eou__ that's too bad , anyway , i'm sure things will turn around next semester . __eou__ i'm thinking of dropping out . __eou__ you can't do that , jenny ! __eou__ i'm dead serious about this , sally . __eou__ come on , let's talk about it .
do you know that john isn't going to come back to our school ? __eou__ really ? why ? __eou__ he had moved and held a party on july 1st . __eou__ it's a pity that i was traveling around europe at that time . __eou__ even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends . __eou__ you're right ! i will call him this weekend and meet him .
oh , my god . how can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? __eou__ our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . __eou__ have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? __eou__ in fact , i just swept the floor three days ago . __eou__ i think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system . __eou__ i bet nobody will care about it .
i'm frustrated . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ i can't work out this problem . __eou__ let me take a look . maybe i can figure it out . __eou__ thanks . i really appreciate it .
well , if it isn't the teacher's pet ! __eou__ stop it . teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . __eou__ you can't prove that by me . i saw the score on your report . __eou__ hey , i worked hard on that report and i deserve the grade i got . __eou__ it just happened to be the highest grade in the class . __eou__ you're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . admit it . __eou__ i worked hard too . but she always gives me a lower grade . __eou__ if you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it .
is this the a housing office ? __eou__ yes , it is . are you looking for housing for this semester ? __eou__ i was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full . __eou__ it is , but i can put you on a waiting list , if you would like . __eou__ please . and in the mean time , can i look at apartments available in the area from this office ? __eou__ yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for as . __eou__ who do i talk to if i want i to see some of them ? __eou__ the individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . you can call them with any questions you may have .
it's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . __eou__ yes , i've been thinking about visiting you . i hope to get some advice from you . __eou__ which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ my field is electronic engineering . which country do you think i should go ? __eou__ were i in your position , i'd go to america . __eou__ which university should i apply to ? __eou__ there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard , yale , the university of michigan , and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . __eou__ oh , i see . thank you very much .
emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ? __eou__ more than one . i think the count is now three , if i remember correctly . __eou__ wow . i'm getting rushed too , but just one . are you thinking of joining any of them ? __eou__ i don't know . i know there are advantages to joining , but i'm not much into group stuff . __eou__ the guys i've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group . __eou__ i think i'm going to decline . i just prefer to do my own thing . __eou__ were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ? __eou__ my dad was , but not my mom .
how many credits are you taking this semester ? __eou__ i have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . but so far , i only have fifteen . __eou__ what's the matter , are the classes you want full ? __eou__ yes . and now i'm down to either taking a class i'm not going to need or considering a double major . __eou__ if you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ? __eou__ i think with international business a language would be appropriate . __eou__ have you even thought that far ahead ? i mean what country would you like to do business with ? __eou__ as a matter of fact , i would like to work in south america . so some latin language like spanish or portuguese would work .
i am sorry to trouble you again , mr.stone . __eou__ it's ok . what do you want to ask ? __eou__ where should i go after i arrived at the university ? __eou__ the first place you should go is the international center . __eou__ why ? __eou__ you can get help there in dealing with the united states immigration and naturalization service ; you can find foreign student advisers . __eou__ what kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? __eou__ they'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . __eou__ can we get any more help at the international center ? __eou__ yes , a lot more . if you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student id and social security number there . they will keep your documents up-to-date . they will offer an orientation program for new comers . they will also help you contact your department and registration office . __eou__ i see . it must be worth going to . __eou__ besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . in cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the international center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . __eou__ wonderful . it is a home for foreign students . __eou__ it sure is . they also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . the center staff members are also friendly and helpful . everyone loves them .
what are you going to do for one year abroad , tom ? __eou__ study , study , study . i want to learn a lot . __eou__ you are going to take courses ? __eou__ yes . i am going to take some university courses there . __eou__ sounds hard . __eou__ yes , but i think it's probably for the best . __eou__ won't you get lonely ? __eou__ hey , i am a pretty cool guy . i will make friends , and i'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . you know , like fencing , or theater or something .
what do you think of your teacher ? __eou__ he's very strict with us . __eou__ and i hear he gives very good lectures . __eou__ indeed . he's strict with himself too . we can see every lecture of his is well-prepared .
could you tell me how to use the library ? __eou__ sure . all you need is your student id card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library . __eou__ how many books am i allowed to check out at a time ? __eou__ two books at a time . except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library . __eou__ how long can i keep the books ? __eou__ for one month . if you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . but if you renew them , you can keep them longer . __eou__ i see . now i want to check out two books on spoken english . can you show me where i can find them ? __eou__ yes , just over there to your right . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
hi . what's your name ? __eou__ my name is jung min . what's your name ? __eou__ my name is jessica . it's nice to meet you . __eou__ yes . it's nice to meet you too . are you a new student too ? __eou__ no . i'm a sophomore . i take it you are a new student ? __eou__ yeah . it's pretty exciting to be here . __eou__ have fun while it lasts . the excitement wears off real quick . especially after you see how much homework you get . where are you from ? __eou__ i'm from korea . my parents wanted me to go to an american university , so i came here . __eou__ i have never been to korea . i've been to japan before , but never korea . __eou__ why were you in japan ? __eou__ my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . he's so into learning about different cultures . __eou__ that's pretty cool . __eou__ i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents . __eou__ well , if you ever want to visit korea , i would be happy to show you around . __eou__ thanks for the offer . i'll keep that in mind . oh , the professor is coming . we'll talk more after class . __eou__ ok .
hey john , did you register for classes yet ? __eou__ i register this friday . __eou__ what classes do you plan on taking ? __eou__ i really want to take the communication class , but i don't know if it will be available . __eou__ is that class really that popular ? __eou__ yeah . i tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time i registered . __eou__ what other classes are you going to take ? __eou__ i still need to take english 201 , but i really don't like writing . __eou__ i took that class already . there is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . __eou__ oh really ? who was the instructor ? there are like 4 different instructors to choose from . __eou__ i had professor mahoney . __eou__ is he an easy grader ? __eou__ i'm not sure if he is or not , but i thought he was definitely fair . __eou__ do you mind if i ask you what you got ? __eou__ not at all . i got a 3.8 . __eou__ well , what did you get in english 101 last year ? __eou__ i got a 4.0 in that class . __eou__ well , i can't compare to you . i got a 3.1 in english 101 . that means if you got a lower grade in english 201 , it must be harder . __eou__ it's not what it appears . i actually tried harder in the 101 class . if i put as much effort into the 201 class , i would have received the same grade . __eou__ oh . that helps . thanks .
did you get your grades yet ? __eou__ yeah . my whole gpa is screwed up now . __eou__ why ? what happened ? __eou__ well , i bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . __eou__ ouch . you must be very disappointed . __eou__ well , it's my fault because i didn't study as much as i should have . __eou__ why don't you re-take the class next year ? __eou__ that's what i plan on doing unless i keep screwing up . how did you do this semester ? __eou__ i didn't do that well either . i ended up with a 3.2 this semester . that drops my total gpa to 3.45 . __eou__ my gpa is pretty similar to yours . i have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . __eou__ what was your gpa before this semester ? __eou__ i was sitting happy with a 3.4 . __eou__ why did it go down so much ? __eou__ let's just say i screwed up more than my econ class . __eou__ what happened to you ? __eou__ i started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . __eou__ you better stop slacking off . __eou__ you're right . i'm not going to play games during school anymore .
hi mark . __eou__ oh , hi stacy . __eou__ how was your summer vacation ? __eou__ i worked over the summer at a restaurant . have to make tuition money , right ? what did you do ? __eou__ i took summer school . i withdrew from two of my classes last year so i wanted to make them up . __eou__ so are you officially a junior now ? __eou__ yeah . and i have 5 credits to spare . i only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but i took 15 because the price was the same . __eou__ that makes sense . so where is nicole ? __eou__ she dropped out of school completely . __eou__ really ? why ? __eou__ she worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . __eou__ wow . she's so lucky . she doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . __eou__ it sounds good now , but i'm traditional . i want the degree , so i wouldn't have accepted the offer . __eou__ do you know how much they are paying her ? __eou__ i don't know . but i bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it .
hey mike . i forgot about registration . i'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . what do you think i should do ? __eou__ you're screwed . you can't do anything about that . you have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . __eou__ do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? __eou__ no . they will tell you the same thing in a worse way . __eou__ did you register yet ? __eou__ of course . registering for classes is not something you want to miss . __eou__ what classes do you think are still open ? __eou__ well , i know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . you can also get into sociology . __eou__ that's helpful . thanks . but what do you think about philosophy . i wanted to take that class this semester . __eou__ i took that class last year . the professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . __eou__ he does that ? __eou__ i guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . __eou__ that makes sense . i think i'll do that . thanks for all the help . __eou__ no problem , man .
did you already take the history exam ? __eou__ yeah . it was hard . when do you take it ? __eou__ i take it tomorrow morning . there is so much material that i dont know what to emphasize on . what types of questions did you get ? __eou__ mostly on the civil war . you should also study the impact martin luther king jr . had on american society . __eou__ what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ? __eou__ i only had 1 question about him . but you might get more . i dont know if he will have the same exam or not . __eou__ hopefully he will use the same exam , cause im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . __eou__ if you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . __eou__ aright . thanks for the info . i gotta go to the library now . __eou__ good luck . __eou__ thanks . see ya .
can i help you ? __eou__ yes , i ’ m doing some research on roman civilization . do you have any books on the subject ? __eou__ these books over here are about ancient history . they might be helpful . __eou__ can i check this one out ? __eou__ i ’ m sorry . it ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . but you ’ re welcome to look through it . __eou__ ok . and i ’ d like to check these books out . __eou__ all right . they ’ re due back next wednesday . __eou__ thanks for your help .
hi kevin , how was your year at college ? __eou__ it was great ! how was your year ? __eou__ it was good . do you have a girlfriend at school ? __eou__ yes , i'm dating someone . her name is amanda .
good morning , john . have you finished reading the novel by dickens borrowed from the library ? __eou__ no . i caught a cold two days ago . i only finish reading half of it . __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that . how are you feeling now ? __eou__ i'm feeling better today . __eou__ how many days do you plan to finish reading it ? __eou__ about more three days , i think . __eou__ ok . after three days , i will come to you for it . __eou__ no problem .
you'd better prepare for the examination . __eou__ i don't think the exam will be very hard . __eou__ you should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . __eou__ maybe you're right . i have been too lazy lately .
han maimed , what's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ i plan to travel around harvard university and know more about it . to tell you the truth , i plan to apply for harvard after graduation from high school . it ’ s better to get to know it . what about you ? __eou__ i get together with my christian brothers on saturdays . __eou__ oh , my god ! john , i didn ’ t know you are religious . you just look like a scientific kook , like leonard in the big bang theory . __eou__ come on , han maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . a lot of americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ but i ’ m really surprised . i thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ yes , they are compatible . actually , the u . s . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ i've heard about it a little bit before , but i don ’ t understand . how can people believe in god since they know god doesn't exist ? __eou__ that ’ s a little complicated . you ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the u . s . history later on . religion was and is a part of american people ’ s life . guess what ? even harvard university , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ really ? __eou__ absolutely ! it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england . __eou__ why was it founded by the puritans ? where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans . __eou__ how come ? i mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ that ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in england . many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ so , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in england ? __eou__ yes , that's why puritans moved to the new world , where they believed they could establish a heaven for puritans . later on , it was these puritans who founded harvard college . __eou__ why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england . they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ oh , i see . __eou__ actually harvard was first named ' new college ' , without a formal name . __eou__ when did it begin to be called harvard university ? __eou__ in 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard . interestingly , johnharvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ it seems that harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note harvard . __eou__ wow , i didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in harvard history . __eou__ religion has been playing an indispensible part in harvard history as well as the u . s . __eou__ i finally begin to get to know harvard . it seems that my knowledge of harvard is rather poor . i have a lot work to do before applying for harvard . __eou__ remember that harvard is a part of the united states . so you have to know the u . s . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of harvard . the two are closely related . __eou__ that ’ s right . i have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ you can ask me any question at any time .
hey jack . how were your classes this semester ? __eou__ they were not too bad . i really liked my poli-sci class . __eou__ would you consider it your favorite class ? __eou__ i don't know if i would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there . __eou__ what class was your favorite then ? __eou__ i took a business communication class last year and it was terrific . __eou__ i never took that yet . if that was your favorite , i think i will check it out .
did you ever take history 231 ? __eou__ yeah . last semester . __eou__ who was the professor ? __eou__ it was professor johnson . __eou__ i have him this semester . what do you think about him ? __eou__ he's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . __eou__ what did you end up getting ? __eou__ i got an a - . sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so i don't know how i got a decent grade . __eou__ that's probably because he grades on a curve . __eou__ are you enjoying the class so far ? __eou__ i hate it and i was about to withdrawal . but after hearing your experience , i think i will tough it out . __eou__ yes . definitely stay in the class . you will get a better grade than your test scores . he does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . __eou__ thanks for letting me know . i feel relieved now .
hi jackie . you don't look too well . what's going on ? __eou__ it's nothing . i'm just a little stressed out . __eou__ why ? what's stressing you out ? __eou__ school . since i was working part time , i had a difficult time keeping up with class . now that we have exams coming up , i'm totally freaking out . __eou__ the best thing to do is study as much as you can . i'm sure you'll do alright . __eou__ i hope so . i guess i won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . that's what it'll take . __eou__ i have to study for an exam too . why don't we study together . we can encourage each other . __eou__ that will be great .
hi ! dick . where are you going ? you're in such a hurry . __eou__ playground . we're having sports for today's outside class activities . all my classmates have already got there . __eou__ what are you going to play ? __eou__ some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . __eou__ enjoy yourself .
it's weekend again , i'm glad i can arrange for my personal matters . __eou__ what do you mean by that ? __eou__ oh , that means i can do whatever i like without few interruptions . __eou__ you've been always active and versatile . it seems that you are interested in everything . __eou__ oh , really ? i just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . what about yours ? __eou__ i have fewer hobbies than yours . that's why i find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . __eou__ oh , you can't think like that . we young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . you like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? __eou__ that's a good suggestion . it's fine today . maybe i can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . it must be fantastic . __eou__ i quite agree with you . with our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . __eou__ and i can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . __eou__ yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . those who practise calligraphy and qigong always live longer .
david , what do you want to do after graduation ? __eou__ i suppose i should choose one from the ' best career list ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? __eou__ that sounds like a hot job , right ? but in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . __eou__ it beats me ! i never thought about it before and maybe i thought finding a career is a simple thing . __eou__ you'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision .
it's a sunny day , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , it is . i'm jennifer . nice to meet you . __eou__ my name is david . nice to meet you , too . __eou__ are you american ? __eou__ no , i'm a britisher . where do you come from ? __eou__ i come from america . are you a freshman ? __eou__ yes . what about you ? __eou__ me , too . __eou__ great . maybe we can study and play games together . i think we can be good friends . __eou__ yeah . anytime .
excuse me . may i ask you some questions ? __eou__ sure . what do you want to know ? __eou__ could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ? __eou__ well , you have to get 166 credits , including required courses and optional courses . __eou__ ok . and how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree ? __eou__ it can be completed in four years normally . __eou__ i see . thank you very much . __eou__ you're welcome .

i am certain i am going to fail my english test . __eou__ why are you so pessimistic ? __eou__ because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week . __eou__ only for this reason ? __eou__ yes , i think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad . __eou__ don't worry about it . practice makes perfect . i will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . i believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . __eou__ oh , thank you . that's very nice of you .
how do i apply to an american university ? __eou__ you should go to the library to find some information about american universities , and write to the admission office . then the admission office will send you application forms and other related materials . from experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . __eou__ i was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . __eou__ that is true . i ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . first of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official toefl ( test of english as a foreign language ) score ( it ’ s usually 550 ) . then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . __eou__ what's to come next ? __eou__ if they agree to enroll you , they will send you a tap - 66 form . with tap - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the us . embassy in beijing . __eou__ how long will it take to go over all the procedures ? __eou__ from 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . __eou__ thank you . i appreciate your help . __eou__ you are welcome . please feel free to ask if you have any more questions .
i am going to give you an end-of-the-unit test this friday . please be prepared for it . __eou__ would you please tell us how to review our lessons ? __eou__ review all the lessons in this unit and see if you can understand the main idea of each lesson . __eou__ any other requirements ? __eou__ phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . you should know how to use them . __eou__ should we remember all the new words and expressions ? __eou__ certainly . __eou__ sorry , i don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit . i wonder if you could help us to solve the problems . __eou__ well . when you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then i will give you some coaching . __eou__ when shall we have a coaching period ? __eou__ how about tomorrow ? __eou__ ok .

i ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for . __eou__ are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ i ’ m not sure . what ’ s the difference between them ? __eou__ public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ which is better ? __eou__ one isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . it depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ i hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . __eou__ yeah , sometimes .

wake up , erik , time to rise and shine . __eou__ huh , oh , hi , jane . i must have fallen asleep while i was reading . __eou__ you and everyone else . it looks more like a camp-ground than a library . __eou__ well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and i guess this place is too quiet . __eou__ have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? __eou__ no . prof . grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . for once i wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . __eou__ well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of mexico . you seem to be interested in that part of the world . __eou__ i am , but there is too much material to cover . i ’ ll be writing forever , and grant only wants five to seven pages . __eou__ so they limit it to one region of mexico . say the yucatan . you ’ ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . __eou__ that ’ s not a bad idea . i brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . that would be great resource material . now if i can only remember where i put them .
what ’ s your schedule like this year ? __eou__ pretty busy . i have to pick up a lot of credits this year . __eou__ what ’ s your major ? __eou__ i ’ m majoring in french literature . __eou__ oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? it ’ s really difficult . i hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long . __eou__ that ’ s right . we got the assignment last week . __eou__ when is it due ? __eou__ next monday ! __eou__ remind me never to sign up for that course !
i wanna register for this mathematics course . __eou__ i ’ m sorry registration has closed . __eou__ closed ? the clerk told me i could come back and register any time during the first week of classes . __eou__ well , that ’ s not possible . the computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . and that ’ s what our budget is based on . who told you that anyway ? __eou__ some woman in here when i tried to register three weeks ago . she said i just had to pay a late fee . __eou__ she must have been a part-time worker . they didn ’ t have much training . why didn ’ t you register then ? __eou__ she said i couldn ’ t until i had my birth certificate . here it is . __eou__ huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . we only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine . __eou__ serious ? only the proof of my address . __eou__ yes , i am afraid she gave you the wrong information . __eou__ but it ’ s unfair . __eou__ well , i sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , i don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . you were trapped in the system.if you want , you can talk to the director . she will help you if she can . __eou__ great . __eou__ don ’ t get your hopes up .

how did you choose courses when you were abroad ? __eou__ that's a very good question . choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . in order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a program adviser or academic counselor . __eou__ wait a minute . there are some new terms for me . i can hardly follow you . __eou__ ok , i will go into more detail . a program adviser or an academic counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . you can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . you will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . __eou__ everything is so new to me . i think i'll have to experience a very difficult period when i get there . __eou__ sure , very difficult . __eou__ i am very grateful for your advice . __eou__ it's my pleasure to talk with you .

i am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ i am not sure . what's the difference between them ? __eou__ public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ which is better ? __eou__ one isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . it depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ i hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . __eou__ yes , sometimes .
it's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . __eou__ yes , i've been thinking about visiting you . i hope to get some advice from you . __eou__ which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ my field is electronic engineering . which country do you think i should go ? __eou__ were i in your position , i ’ d go to america . __eou__ which university should i apply to ? __eou__ there are many universities for you to choose from . some famous universities such as harvard , yale , the university of michigan , and massachusetts institute of technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . __eou__ oh , i see . thank you very much .
the final examination will be held at the end of this month . have you made good preparation ? __eou__ sure . i've reviewed all the lessons i have learned this academic year . __eou__ are you sure you can do well this year ? __eou__ i am 100 % certain . __eou__ according to what you did last time , i have my doubts . __eou__ i am sure i can get a 95 this time .

how should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? we have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events . __eou__ we should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . we could have a firework display . __eou__ do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ? __eou__ if we do , too many people might attend . perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend . __eou__ good idea . we should also hold a series of presentations . we could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . __eou__ good idea ! i think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . __eou__ we could have another on the successes of graduates from here . __eou__ i think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , t-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . __eou__ that ’ s an excellent idea . hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! a few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . __eou__ i ’ m looking forward to reading that . we could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . __eou__ a group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . __eou__ i ’ m sure that will be very popular .. ok , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice .

do you speak only english in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in spanish ? __eou__ oh , we never speak spanish in class ! miss.parker speaks to us only in english . __eou__ i suppose she's right . does she speak english very slowly ? __eou__ not always . sometimes we don't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ it must be interesting to study english . __eou__ mario and i are the best students in the class . miss.parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ is english pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ sometimes it's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .

can i help you ? __eou__ yes . i am a bit confused . my sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called sociology and the modern age . according to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but i haven't been able to find it . __eou__ do you have your syllabus with you ? may i see it ? __eou__ yes , uh ... i put it in the front of my sociology notebook . oh , here it is . __eou__ let me see . oh yes . your professor has placed this book on reserve . that means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . you need to go to a special room called the reserve room . it's down the hall and to the right . __eou__ i'm sorry - i still don't understand . __eou__ you see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . if one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . so , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . __eou__ so , will i be able to find this book ? __eou__ yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . the student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she must read it in the library during that time . that way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . __eou__ okay . thank you . i understand now . __eou__ will there be anything else ? __eou__ no ! i am on my way to the reserve room . thanks again !

there are lots of new teachers in our class this semester . __eou__ yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ? __eou__ to be honest , i like all of them , except for the math teacher . though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . he's so boring . __eou__ i think so too . i don't like him either . well , who do you like best ? __eou__ it might be the english teacher . what about you ? __eou__ me , too . she speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her . __eou__ she is a pretty good teacher ! with her help i think i can make great progress in english . __eou__ yeah , i like her way of teaching . she told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . __eou__ i think it's a good way to develop our language ability . __eou__ actually , our new math teacher is a good person . he just can't find an appropriate way to teach us .
i've been so stressed these days . __eou__ what's the matter ? are you ok ? __eou__ i don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . __eou__ don't worry . you have plenty of time to decide . __eou__ and i also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . i want to get the burden off my family . __eou__ you always worry too much about everything . take it easy , honey . you are good enough . you can go to the ideal college . __eou__ ok , ok . i'm so sorry . by the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? __eou__ in a perfect world , i would enjoy my work if i do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! __eou__ ok , honey , stop dreaming . you should face the reality . __eou__ that's only a joke . to be honest , i have to improve my english , because my english is not good enough . i still get confused about some simple grammars . since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ en , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . second , i suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . __eou__ is the training center helpful ? __eou__ i think so . because i've taken one to improve my oral english during summer vacation .

what book is that ? __eou__ i just bought a new atlas . i ’ m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that ’ s a vast country . __eou__ canada , china , and the use are huge too . __eou__ there are several tiny countries in the world too . countries like monaco are smaller than many cities . __eou__ those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very l __eou__ britain is half the size of france , but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . __eou__ the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .

can you tell me where i can park ? __eou__ are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile ? __eou__ i drive an automobile . __eou__ fine . you can either park in the student lot or on the street . do you know what a handicapped space is ? __eou__ yes , i have seen those spots . __eou__ well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ? __eou__ i park in the evenings . __eou__ then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs . have you seen those signs ? __eou__ yes , i have seen those signs . __eou__ the signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days . do you know how to read the curb colors ? __eou__ yes , i know what the curb colors mean . __eou__ well , just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading , i think you know what you need to know .
good morning . is this where i can get a library card issued to me ? __eou__ no problem , we have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done . __eou__ i'm done . __eou__ that looks great , but i will also need your driver's license or other form of i . d . __eou__ sure , here it is . __eou__ well , this looks nice . do you know how to use it ? __eou__ i am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ? __eou__ of course , just remember that all of the needed information is on the card . __eou__ i see . __eou__ well , i hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits !
professor , i will not be here for our next class meeting . __eou__ is this absolutely necessary ? __eou__ i tried to work something out , but i really do have to miss one class . __eou__ will you be able to make up the work you missed ? __eou__ i'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading . __eou__ remember that i will only let you miss one class meeting per semester . __eou__ yes , i remember . __eou__ could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ? __eou__ sure , no problem . __eou__ make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester !
excuse me , professor . i am going to miss next week's class . __eou__ is this something that you could schedule for another time ? __eou__ no , i have to do this ; it's important ! __eou__ have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ? __eou__ i've made arrangements with a friend to help me . __eou__ you know that i only allow one absence per semester , don't you ? __eou__ yes , i know . __eou__ write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me . __eou__ ok , i can do that . __eou__ well , have a good day off from class .
i would like to register for a class today . __eou__ no problem , what class would you like to take ? __eou__ i would very much enjoy taking a psychology class.because i'm crazy . __eou__ there are two classes that are still open . __eou__ which days are these classes on ? __eou__ the first class is a tuesday and thursday class from two to three . __eou__ what about the other class ? __eou__ the other class is on monday and wednesday from 10 am - 12 . __eou__ are you sure there are no more open classes ? __eou__ i'm positive . __eou__ sign me up for monday and wednesday . __eou__ okay , i'll sign you up .
can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is ? __eou__ we are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a . m . next monday . do you have something to write that down on ? __eou__ yes , i can write that on my calendar . __eou__ that will be on the second of december . be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus . do you understand ? __eou__ yes , i understand . __eou__ the bus will bring you back 6 days later on december 8th . is someone coming to get you ? __eou__ no , i don't have a ride yet . __eou__ we will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 p.m.any more questions . __eou__ how much will the trip cost ? __eou__ i put all of that information in the packet . i'll give you another copy if you need one . see you on monday !
hello , i need to register for a class . __eou__ what class are you trying to take ? __eou__ i want to take a psychology class . __eou__ well , there are only two classes open . __eou__ can you tell me what days the classes are on ? __eou__ one class is on tuesday and thursday from 2 p . m . to 4 . __eou__ and the other class ? __eou__ that class is from ten to twelve on monday and wednesday . __eou__ are you sure these are the only open classes ? __eou__ yes , i am sure . __eou__ okay , sign me up for the class on monday and wednesday . __eou__ very well then .
could you help me to register for a class ? __eou__ do you know what class you want to take ? __eou__ are there any psychology classes available ? __eou__ i believe there are still two psychology classes open . __eou__ on what days are the classes ? __eou__ there is one class on tuesday and thursday from 2 to 4 . __eou__ can you tell me about the other class ? __eou__ it's from 10-12 on monday and wednesday . __eou__ you're positive that these are the only classes left ? __eou__ these two are the only ones . __eou__ the class on monday and wednesday will be fine . __eou__ very good .
you spoken english is pretty good . please tell me your experience in learning english . __eou__ uh , i don't know what to say . what do you want to know ? __eou__ what's your method of learning ? __eou__ let me think a minute . i think i always try to take every chance to practice . __eou__ what if there is no chance ? i mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? __eou__ well , i talk to myself . that is , i play one role first , than the other . __eou__ that's a good idea . you are really creative .
could you help me ? __eou__ what do you need ? __eou__ i can't seem to find my class . __eou__ what building is it in ? __eou__ it's in the c building . __eou__ oh , i know exactly where that is . __eou__ do you think you can tell me where it is ? __eou__ sure , what room number is it ? __eou__ it's room number 261 . __eou__ i have a class around there right now . __eou__ could you show me where it is ? __eou__ no problem , come on .
my german teacher thought it would be a good idea to have german pen friends to write to in german . __eou__ what a great idea ! now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! __eou__ the only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in english . __eou__ oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . __eou__ that's right . and it's a b that i'll be writing too . her name is olga . __eou__ maybe olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in german and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in english . __eou__ that's a great idea ! why didn't i think of that ? __eou__ i don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends !
i used to think that americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it . __eou__ you did ? __eou__ yes . but now i ’ ve learned differently . now i have a more realistic opinion . __eou__ what do you think now ? __eou__ there are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . there is a high standard of living . people earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . so there isn ’ t so much money after all . __eou__ but i still say americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we chinese do . __eou__ that ’ s true . but americans work hard for their money like we do . i don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different .
how long will it take to learn english ? will i be able to take other courses next semester or will english take up all of my time ? __eou__ it ’ s hard to say . language isn ’ t like other studies . __eou__ you mean i could finish this course and still not know english ? you ’ ve got to be kidding ! __eou__ i ’ m not kidding . learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . __eou__ so do we have to stay in this english class forever ? __eou__ no . you just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . then you go on practicing and learning outside . a lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . __eou__ so it ’ s really the same story . practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . __eou__ you said it .
how are you doing with your english language studies ? __eou__ i think i'm making good progress . __eou__ is it harder than you thought ? __eou__ at first it was , but now i've got the basics.it ' s fun .
i have a real problem when i meet people . __eou__ what is it ? maybe i can help . __eou__ i never know when to shake hands and when not to . can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ do you come from a country where they shake hands ? __eou__ oh yes . men , women , and children shake hands all the time . __eou__ it ’ s very simple . men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . __eou__ but some women do shake hands . and now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . __eou__ well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . __eou__ that sounds easy enough . __eou__ sure . once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! it ’ s nothing to worry about .
what do you think is harder , reading or writing ? __eou__ well , they ’ re completely different . reading is passive , and writing is active . __eou__ i don ’ t think i understand what you mean . could you explain a little more ? __eou__ in reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . in writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . __eou__ oh , now i see what you mean . when you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! __eou__ a reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ i think i see what you mean . i can read shakespeare but i definitely can ’ t write it . __eou__ exactly . __eou__ so i have another question for you . what do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? __eou__ they ’ re both harder than reading or writing . __eou__ in what way ? __eou__ because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . this time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of english . __eou__ you are making me feel really discouraged . __eou__ i ’ m not trying to discourage you . i ’ m trying to help you . you have to live with these difficulties . isn ’ t it better to know about them ? the more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . i promise !
i ’ ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between english for chinese students and english for native students ? __eou__ i don ’ t know . what do you think ? __eou__ i think a chinese student concentrates on written english , and uses it as a basis for communicating . from start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . this is a very difficult way to learn . __eou__ what do natives get ? __eou__ they get higher level english , which is more formal than everyday spoken english . they also deal with matters of style and creativity . __eou__ do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? __eou__ absolutely not ! native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard english is spoken . __eou__ i suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard english in american universities . __eou__ actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . that ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . just talk to everyone every chance you get .
do you mind if i ask you a question ? __eou__ no , not at all . go ahead . __eou__ what do you do in order to improve your english ? __eou__ i go to movies ; i go to lectures ; i listen to the radio ; i do lots of things . most importantly , i practice every chance i get . __eou__ it ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ sure . it ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! it ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ it takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ it certainly does . but if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress .
would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? __eou__ i think i will continue my studies . now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . we are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . __eou__ so you will continue to study for a master's degree ? __eou__ well , i think so . but i am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . if can get a ph . d . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . __eou__ how can you finance your education abroad ? it is very expensive to study abroad . __eou__ i think i will try to get the scholarship since i really don't have so much money to study abroad . actually now i am preparing for the tefl and gre exams . if i can get high marks in the two exams and if i am lucky enough , i may get a scholarship . __eou__ it could be pretty tough studying abroad . being so far away from home ...
are you ok , chuck ? you look pale . __eou__ i'm fine , katherine . i just stayed up late last night working on my chinese . __eou__ oh , poor you . you know what ? i found a new way to learn chinese and it works very well . __eou__ you did ? do tell me . i've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but i've made little progress ! __eou__ sure . i'm learning chinese through songs . __eou__ so you're learning chinese songs ? __eou__ you can say that . i can actually sing some of them now . __eou__ that's a real achievement . how did you do that ? __eou__ i start by listening to the song a few times and after several times i am able to follow the singer . __eou__ it makes sense . __eou__ it does . i've learned some chinese folk songs this way . they are clearly presented and easy to follow . __eou__ can join you , katherine ? i do want to have a try . __eou__ why not ? i downloaded a beautiful song the other day . we can learn it together now . __eou__ great . do you think we need a chinese dictionary ? __eou__ yes , just in case we run into me new characters . __eou__ ok . i will bring it with me .
how's your time spent in the united states ? __eou__ well , pretty good . __eou__ i'm glad to hear that . what impressed you most ? __eou__ well , the cultural differences impressed me most . __eou__ you mean we chinese think differently from the americans ? __eou__ that's right , quite different . one day one of my american friend looked pale , so i asked him whether he was sick or not . but he was reluctant to answer my question . __eou__ that's weird . __eou__ and what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , i suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible . __eou__ you really cared about your friend . __eou__ sure i am . but he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . __eou__ i'm confused . why did he say that ? __eou__ i felt the same at first . later he told me that i'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . but back in china , helping others is always regarded being kind . __eou__ absolutely . now i understand why he responded that way .
matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? __eou__ sure , i've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . why ? __eou__ well , i had a meeting today with a woman from japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! i didn't know what to do ! __eou__ did you bow back ? __eou__ no , i tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp i was a bit offended . __eou__ well , japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in japan . she might have been offended by your strong handshake . __eou__ but she was in america ! shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in america signify confidence and respect ? __eou__ things are different in japan . you know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . __eou__ is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? __eou__ i think it's highly possible , yes . __eou__ the meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . i think i need to read up about intercultural communication before i have another meeting with someone from another country . __eou__ that's a good idea . when you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . __eou__ that's so true . it's great that we see eye to eye on this .
how long have you been in america ? __eou__ for more than five years . __eou__ do you think it's easy for a chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? __eou__ it's no picnic .
have you adapted to the lifestyle in china ? __eou__ yeah , almost . but there is one thing . __eou__ what ? __eou__ i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i don't mean to say that there's no privacy in china , but ... __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ some of my chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__ that makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__ yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__ perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__ i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding . __eou__ well , that's not rare . i've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__ just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ oh , i'm shocked .
pardon me . could you please pass me the tissue ? __eou__ sure , here you are . __eou__ thanks , i didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . are you ok ? __eou__ yeah , i think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . but you are chinese , you should have known better . __eou__ well , not every chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from sichuan and guizhou provinces can . back where i come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . __eou__ oh , i see how this food can be really hard for you . i can sympathize with that . i stayed in sichuan for a year . the food was difficult at the beginning . every dish was so spicy . after a while though , i got used to the taste , and now i won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . __eou__ yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , i haven't had the need or the opportunity . every time i try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . __eou__ i completely understand . i didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . __eou__ yeah , i guess that's a typical example of ' when in rome , do as the romans do . ' __eou__ exactly .
hi , my name is lean , and i'm from russia . __eou__ nice to meet you , lvan.my name is alike . i'm from japan . __eou__ to me english is a difficult language . __eou__ a second language is always difficult . __eou__ true , but english is harder than most.it ' s a crazy language . __eou__ a crazy language ? why do you say that ? __eou__ one letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . __eou__ no wonder you say english is a crazy language .
do you speak only english in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in spanish ? __eou__ oh , we never speak spanish in class ! miss.parker speaks to us only in english . __eou__ i suppose she's right . does she speak english very slowly ? __eou__ not always . sometimes we don't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said . __eou__ it must be interesting to study english . __eou__ mario and i are the best students in the class . miss parker says that my pronunciation is very good . __eou__ is english pronunciation easy or difficult ? __eou__ sometimes it's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
what were you and richard talking about earlier ? it looked intense . __eou__ yeah , richard said something to me that i didn't appreciate . __eou__ oh , no . i know how insensitive he can be . what has he done now ? __eou__ he asked me how long it took me to learn english . __eou__ but , you were born and raised in california ! __eou__ yeah , but i get that sometimes . it doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the u . s . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . __eou__ what a racist ! how can you stand working with the guy ? __eou__ you know , richard isn't such a bad guy . he made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . __eou__ so , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english ? __eou__ i told him 28 years . and , he knows i'm 28 years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week . he was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . __eou__ are you sure he really got the message ? __eou__ yeah , i'm pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn english . __eou__ that's hilarious ! what did he say ? __eou__ he said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . he apologized and now , it's all good . __eou__ i'm glad . i bet he won't make that mistake again .
you know , i really don ’ t think americans are very romantic . __eou__ where did you get that idea ? __eou__ that ’ s the impression i get from the movies , and from looking around . men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . __eou__ well , i ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . __eou__ is it true or isn ’ t it ? __eou__ do you want to know something about the american character ? __eou__ i just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . but go ahead . __eou__ no , this will help answer your question . in american society boys and girls are raised together . they ’ re not segregated in their activities ! boys and girls go out together from an early age . __eou__ ok , go on . __eou__ after being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . it really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . does that answer your question ? __eou__ not exactly , but i see your point . __eou__ i think americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . after you ’ ve been in america for a while , you will probably see what i mean .
what do you like to do with your free time ? __eou__ study english . __eou__ you mean you like to study english ? why ? __eou__ it gives me great satisfaction . __eou__ studying english wouldn't give me any satisfaction . it's hard work . __eou__ i don't mind the work . i think it's worthwhile .
hey , your chinese is coming along ! __eou__ you think ? __eou__ yeah . it ’ s a lot better than mine . __eou__ but i still get stuck on the different tones . it drives me crazy . __eou__ hang in there . it ’ ll all come together one of these days .
eric , how long will you be in china ? __eou__ i don't know . well , my contract here is for one year , and i don't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while . __eou__ well , have you ever thought about learning some chinese ? __eou__ actually , i am learning that now . but it's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really freaks me out . __eou__ don't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ you hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ it's where i teach you chinese , and in exchange you teach me english . __eou__ awesome . i've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ? __eou__ how about this sunday ? __eou__ ok , cool . __eou__ good . i'll give you a call tonight . __eou__ no problem . __eou__ bye .
are you studying any languages here ? __eou__ yes , i'm studying in the foreign languages department . __eou__ what are you majoring in ? __eou__ i'm majoring in english . __eou__ is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ yes . the language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . __eou__ do you know anything about britain and america ? __eou__ i'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . i like the culture . __eou__ right.it ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . __eou__ you're right .
well , you seem to enjoy speaking english . __eou__ you can't help learning when you're using it all day . you'll see . a few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you . __eou__ i hope so.you see , at the moment i find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . i'm awfully worried , i can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . __eou__ oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use english throughout the class . she doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . __eou__ you know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use .

i was supposed to meet with you at half past one . __eou__ yes , i see . what did you need to see me about ? __eou__ there's a problem with my schedule . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ two of my classes occur at the same time . __eou__ well , i can see that's a problem . __eou__ is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? __eou__ yes , i can . would you still like to have both of these classes ? __eou__ i want to keep both of them , if that's possible . __eou__ well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day . __eou__ thanks a lot .
excuse me , professor . i think there might be an error in my test score . __eou__ sure . do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right ? __eou__ i think that the percentage is incorrect . __eou__ let's just go over all of it to double-check . __eou__ sure , let's do it . __eou__ here is the answer sheet . do you see a place where i marked something wrong that should have been right ? __eou__ i don't see any mistakes . __eou__ ok , now that we've gotten those straightened out , let's total the score . __eou__ yes , let's total it . __eou__ well , if i total that like this and divide by this number , i get this total . do you agree ? __eou__ yes , you're right . __eou__ well then , we are all straight . have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention .
i was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher . __eou__ is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked ? __eou__ i think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right . __eou__ these things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure , all right ? __eou__ that would be great ! __eou__ look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . do you see any place where i made a mistake in grading ? __eou__ this one right here should be right . __eou__ yeah , i see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ? __eou__ yeah , let's do the math . __eou__ i count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . does this look right to you ? __eou__ looks pretty good . __eou__ thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying !
could we go over some things , because i think my test score is wrong . __eou__ what do you think is wrong , the math or the way your answer was scored ? __eou__ both . __eou__ i am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes , too . will that work for you ? __eou__ yeah , i'm ready . __eou__ check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake . __eou__ these look strange . __eou__ yes , i agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score . would that be ok ? __eou__ ok , let's do the calculation . __eou__ we add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage . __eou__ i see . __eou__ anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask !
i was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades . __eou__ grades are based on many things __eou__ what counts the most ? __eou__ actually i look at all of it and let's not forget class participation . __eou__ do you grade on a curve or use percentages ? __eou__ homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each . __eou__ what if we miss something ? __eou__ i will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time . __eou__ will you tell us if we are failing during the year ? __eou__ you will be able to track your progress during the year .
what do you base our grades on ? __eou__ all of your coursework is important , including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester . __eou__ does the final count the most ? __eou__ all of it is important ; please just do your best at all times . __eou__ how do you total our scores ? __eou__ the final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest . __eou__ what if we are out sick ? __eou__ make sure you contact me as i only allow one unexcused absence . __eou__ how can we know if we are doing ok during the year ? __eou__ your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on .
i'd like to talk to you about my grades . __eou__ sure ! what exactly do you have questions about ? __eou__ i am worried that i messed up on a test . __eou__ well , let me take a look at my grade book . how do you think you are doing ? __eou__ i think i am doing great , except for that one test ! __eou__ well , your scores show that you could do a little better . what do you think you could improve on ? __eou__ i think that i could study a little harder for tests . __eou__ fine ! please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin . __eou__ yes , i know . __eou__ i'm sure you'll do fine .
what can i help you with today ? __eou__ i need to check out this book . __eou__ do you have your library card ? __eou__ i don ’ t have one . __eou__ would you like to apply for one right now ? __eou__ that ’ s fine . __eou__ i ’ m going to need you to fill out the application . __eou__ all right . all done . __eou__ all right , now please sign the back of the card . __eou__ okay . i ’ ve signed it . __eou__ that ’ s all there is to it . __eou__ great . now can i check out this book ?
how do you decide what grade we get ? __eou__ i look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests . __eou__ what is the most important factor ? __eou__ obviously i look for improvement as we go along , but i would like you to do your best from the beginning . __eou__ how can we keep track of our grades ? __eou__ the final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent . __eou__ what if we can't get to school ? __eou__ you can only miss one class without penalty . __eou__ if we have a major problem , will you let us know ? __eou__ i will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .
professor , i'm concerned about my grades . do you have a minute ? __eou__ of course , how can i help you ? __eou__ i want to know if i am doing ok . __eou__ let's pull out your scores so far . do you think you are doing ok ? __eou__ i am afraid that i might not be doing all that well . __eou__ i'm seeing that you are doing ok in some areas , but not so well in others . __eou__ i think i could take better notes and read a little more . __eou__ you can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on . __eou__ i'm working on it ! __eou__ just do your best and i am sure that you will see improvement .
could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? __eou__ step into my office for a moment . what is your concern ? __eou__ am i failing ? __eou__ let's go on the computer to see what's up . do you think you are doing well ? __eou__ i am pretty sure that i am in trouble . __eou__ i can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? __eou__ i missed a few classes ; i need to make sure i come to school on a regular basis . __eou__ having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? __eou__ i'll try ; it's hard ! __eou__ thanks for stopping by !

what do you think of studying abroad ? __eou__ i think it's a great idea . studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . are you planning on going abroad ? __eou__ yes , i hope so . i am studying for my belts right now . __eou__ which country do you want to go to ? __eou__ i'd like to study in the uk , but it's really expensive . __eou__ have you applied to any schools there ? __eou__ yes , i received a conditional offer from oxford university a few days ago . __eou__ congratulations ! that's excellent news ? what do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ? __eou__ i have to get an belts score of 7.5 overall . do you think i can do that ? __eou__ if you study hard , i don't see why you wouldn't . have you received any other offers ? __eou__ i was also accepted into yale university , and sydney university . __eou__ if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in america . however , if you go to oxford university , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future . __eou__ i just can't decide where to go . it's not an easy decision to make . __eou__ if i were you , i'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . whatever you do , i know you'll succeed .

how was your education going on in australia ? __eou__ i'm going to graduate this summer . __eou__ where are you going to work then , in australia or back in china ? __eou__ i'm planning to return to china after graduation . __eou__ why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . __eou__ well , i think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . __eou__ yeah , china's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . __eou__ absolutely , many chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business . __eou__ the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags amd head for home . __eou__ that's right . most of the chinese students pursuing higher education in australia intend to return to china .

hey , maris , are you a part-timer ? __eou__ part-timer ? is that a new buzzword ? __eou__ oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . so are you ? __eou__ sure , i have a part-time job as a bartender . __eou__ cool ! it must be amazing to work at a bar ! __eou__ yeah , but i ’ m not there for fun . i have to remain professional and if i get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . __eou__ that ’ s true . i ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? __eou__ of course . there ’ s always much to learn . i got to know more about the real world . __eou__ you mean you got working experience , right ? __eou__ not just working experience . i would say the biggest lesson i learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . __eou__ it must be very demanding . __eou__ sometimes it is . but after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . __eou__ really ? it sounds interesting . __eou__ maybe you can come to the bar one day and i ’ ll show you around . __eou__ great . i ’ m looking forward to it .

i'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . __eou__ but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . __eou__ i'll do it someday . but it's not the right time now . i have to learn a lot by working as an employee . __eou__ it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . __eou__ you could say so . i'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . __eou__ it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . __eou__ yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . and their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . __eou__ that's right . you should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? __eou__ well , i'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . __eou__ sounds perfect . i think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . by then , perhaps , i'll join in as a partner of your company .

do you often buy magazines ? __eou__ i buy a computer magazine every month . it keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . __eou__ why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? __eou__ sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . besides , i like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . __eou__ do you have an online edition of that magazine ? __eou__ yes , they do . but you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . __eou__ do you have a subscription ? __eou__ yes , i do . the magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . do you every buy magazines ? __eou__ i only buy them if they look particularly interesting . i don ’ t buy any regularly .

are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? __eou__ the headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . few other stories made the front pages . __eou__ is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? __eou__ there ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . we have a subsidiary company l __eou__ are the reports favorable ? __eou__ generally , the reporters take positive lines . they do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . in the classifieds , one of our competitors is a __eou__ that ’ s interesting . they must be thinking of moving into that market . are there any interesting editorials ? __eou__ not really . they all seem to focus on the election . there have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . __eou__ i ’ m not surprised . that article certainly added fuel to the debate . ok . thanks . can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? i ’ d like to read them . __eou__ sure . there you are .
i see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . are there any interesting articles in it ? __eou__ there ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . i enjoyed reading her thought . the which ? section is very interesting this month . they tested facial cleaners . t __eou__ i like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . __eou__ which tests do you mean ? __eou__ you know . tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ? __eou__ oh , i see . i like to do those tests , too , but i don ’ t take them seriously . __eou__ of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . according to the jealousy test , i ’ m quite a jealous type of person . perhaps i need to control my jealousy . __eou__ you ’ re right . it ’ s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles .
do you buy that newspaper every day ? __eou__ yes , i do . i find it very informative.it always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . __eou__ is there a sunday edition of that newspaper ? __eou__ yes . there is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! it usually takes me a few hours to read it on sunday morning . __eou__ what section does it have ? __eou__ let me see . there ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs . __eou__ what ’ s in that section ? __eou__ world affairs ? they look at the most important stories in more detail . i find it fascinating . do you buy a daily paper ? __eou__ i buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy i nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . i find the local news more interesting than national or international news .
what are you reading ? __eou__ it ’ s an article about language . it talks about the idea of having a single global language . __eou__ it seems that english already is the main global language . does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like esperanto as the world language . __eou__ actually , it suggest english . the main argument is that english is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , india , mexico , nigeria , pakistan , and japan – so beginning again __eou__ does the article say anything about other language ? how will they survive in an english-speaking world ? __eou__ the article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if english continues to be the dominant language .
i can ’ t believe my english teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! __eou__ why not ! it ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . __eou__ but it ’ s so old . __eou__ don ’ t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it ’ s about ? __eou__ no , not at all . __eou__ first of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . __eou__ i didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . what ’ s the main storyline ? __eou__ it ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . __eou__ why does he want to do that ? __eou__ since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way , all of his daughters will be cared for . __eou__ won ’ t they get his inheritance ? __eou__ no , that ’ s the problem . though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . so , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . __eou__ i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . __eou__ so , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? __eou__ there ’ s movie ? my teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! __eou__ that ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . __eou__ it would take a lot less time .. __eou__ how about this . when you finish the book . i ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . __eou__ ok . that sounds like a deal .
what are you reading about in that science magazine ? __eou__ there are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . i just finished reading one about cloning . __eou__ i ’ m not sure i like the idea of that . i don ’ t want people copying me or other people . it could be very confusing . __eou__ according to the article , you have no real need to worry . research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . __eou__ in the future , that could be possible . __eou__ in this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! __eou__ really ? what else have you discovered ? __eou__ i read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . for example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . so , scientists find out why it ’ s immune __eou__ that ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . i prefer natural remedies to man-made ones .
hi cody , how did practicing go this week ? __eou__ well i had several tests and an oral presentation this week so i didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but i think i mastered the tricky section . __eou__ great ! warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . good , good . this week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . now let ’ s take a look at this __eou__ charles ? before i start i was wondering if it was ok if i put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? __eou__ it might work . i ’ ll have to hear it.show me what you ’ ve done . __eou__ it was horrible ! i played play it much better at home ! __eou__ it ’ s just nerves . just play the right hand for now . one two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . good , good . don ’ t forget the accidentals ! the key signature says that note should be a g-sharp b __eou__ is that better ? __eou__ yes , much better . watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . what was that ? __eou__ sorry ! the stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__ that's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . watch your dynamics ! keep your elbows lifted . remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . that ’ s better ! remember that as a pianist or any
hey ! how was your first day of class ? i ’ m in level two and i ’ m loving my class this semester ! it ’ s great being in a class of international students ! __eou__ mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester . __eou__ that ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . it ’ s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans , a pole , a scottish , two french , an american , a brazilian , __eou__ that ’ s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia , except me . there are a few south koreans , several japanese , malaysian , thai , singaporean , filipino , kazakhstan , and o __eou__ well , i think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . you ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture . __eou__ i guess so , but i think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes . __eou__ don ’ t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . __eou__ i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese . __eou__ well , there is that , yes .
hey , joe ! where have you been these past few days ? __eou__ i ’ ve been busy with a first aid course that i started about a week ago at the red cross . __eou__ cool ! i ’ ve always wanted to do something like that ! have you learned anything useful ? __eou__ for sure ! i mean we ’ ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply cpr ! __eou__ have you treated any real emergencies ? __eou__ well , they took us along with some paramedics.there was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . his wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . it was intense ! __eou__ i can imagine ! i tend to faint when i see blood , so i think i won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon !
excuse me ? is this where i register ? i ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . __eou__ yes , of course . i need your student id please . __eou__ here you are . __eou__ okay , susan . it says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . is this information correct ? __eou__ yes . i do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . __eou__ sure.that ’ s not a problem.do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ? __eou__ yeah . here ’ s my list . i ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . __eou__ yeah , that ’ s perfect . what about the subjects for your minor ? __eou__ oh yeah ! almost forgot ! i need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy . __eou__ wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! okay , here you go . you are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start .

alright everyone settle down . let ’ s get started.as you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . it is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . this brings me to our topic for today . does anyone know what we celebrate on may first ? __eou__ cinct de mayo ? __eou__ no , that ’ s may fifth in spanish , james , no wonder you are failing my spanish class . no , may first is international workers ’ day . __eou__ do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ no ! it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the us , but in other countries it is . __eou__ www , man ! __eou__ in the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by april 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the may day movement.previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . they passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . and , on may first 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__ cool ! is that why we only work eight hours now ? __eou__ yes ! but the happy ending came at a high price.on may third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the mccormick reaper works factory , killing four and wounding many . a mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . __eou__ and then what happened ? __eou__ well , as we say , the rest is history ...
hello everyone , and welcome to our cpr for beginners course.first of all , does anyone know what cpr stands for ? __eou__ cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! __eou__ that ’ s right ! we apply cpr in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . __eou__ what does that mean ? __eou__ well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! that ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . let ’ s begin ! i need a volunteer . __eou__ me ! me ! __eou__ alright , come here and lay flat on your back . let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . we must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . __eou__ wait , what are you doing ? i ’ m a married woman ! you can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! __eou__ madam i ’ m not trying to kiss you ! i am trying to demonstrate how to apply cpr in the case of an emergency . __eou__ well , ok . but no french kissing ! __eou__ as i was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . to do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . __eou__ wait , what are you doing ! you can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base !

doris , i'm glad you're home . i'm terrified . i don't know what to do ! __eou__ what is it ? what happened ? __eou__ i think someone is stalking me . __eou__ no , it can't be . really ? who ? __eou__ i don't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring.he just kept staring at me . he didn't stop . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ i didn't do anything . finally , he left.but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but then he came in too . __eou__ did he leave when you left ? __eou__ yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ he followed me all the way home ! __eou__ that's about five blocks . and around corners too.so he was definitely following you . __eou__ yes , he was . i'm not imagining it.finally , just when i got home , i turned around and looked at him.he was just standing there . he didn't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious.what should i do ? i'm so scared . can i call the police ? __eou__ actually , i don't think you can call the police . not yet at least.he hasn't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it.but if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ why can't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me ! __eou__ of course you can call the police if you want . that's not what i mean . i'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ i suppose . what can they do ? i don't even know who he is . __eou__ listen , carol . don't let this bother you too much.probably it's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out.if you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then i think we should go to the police.but for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ alright . and i won't go to that cafe for awhile .
ah ! no ! damn it ! __eou__ it's a blackout . now i can't see seinfeld . __eou__ so what ? i just lost one hour's worth of work . __eou__ really ? how could you do that ? don't you save every couple minutes ? __eou__ no , i didn't save this time.damn it ! and i'm sick of writing this paper . now i have to write it all over again too . __eou__ i've had that problem too many times . so i learned to save.when i'm writing something , i save every three sentences or so . i don't want to lose anything . __eou__ i hate computers . sometimes i think they cause more trouble than they're worth . __eou__ what are we going to do now ? __eou__ i don't know . i feel like going out . __eou__ i wonder how much of the city is down . __eou__ it doesn't matter . i still can go out and buy a beer . __eou__ maybe . but if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.and besides , i know you have a political science exam tomorrow . i thought you had a lot of reading to do . __eou__ yes , that's true . damn ! i just lost half my paper , and now i can't even do my homework.this is a bad time for this to happen . __eou__ i have a flashlight in my closet . if you want to use that to read , you can .

jack i hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . is that right ? __eou__ the news goes so fast . ah , yes , i haven't decided yet . __eou__ don't hesitate . that's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . __eou__ maybe you are right . but the major is not fit for me . i like architecture more than computers . __eou__ but this chance is really precious . __eou__ well , i know . so i am thinking now . __eou__ i hope you can make a clever choice . anyway , the opportunities around you are not that by . __eou__ thank you for your kindness . i will think about it carefully .

morning , peter . nice suit ! a new one ? __eou__ oh , yes . my wife bought it for me yesterday . hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . yellow suits you really well . __eou__ maybe . several people have suggested that i get more yellow clothes . they say the color suits me because i have a fair complexion . __eou__ that's right . you know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . actually , i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . it's just that different colors can give people different impressions . for example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . __eou__ thank you for your compliments . it sounds like you're a clothing expert . __eou__ well , compared with my wife , i'm just a beginner .
excuse me . have you forgotten our drinks ? __eou__ sorry , i'll bring them to you right away . __eou__ why is it taking so long ? __eou__ we are short of staff today . __eou__ there is something wrong with this dish . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ i don't think this is fresh . __eou__ they were delivered this morning . __eou__ would you please ask the manager to come over ?
you ’ re making my blood boil . __eou__ calm down . madam . __eou__ i'm about to explode ! you ’ ve made a mess of this matter . __eou__ i am very sorry to hear that you ’ ve been having so many problems . __eou__ sorry isn ’ t good enough ! what can you do to help me ? __eou__ i understand why you ’ re angry , mrs . wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . __eou__ well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! __eou__ if you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out .
look what you've done ! __eou__ i'm very sorry , sir . i'll bring you a cloth immediately . __eou__ yes , and hurry up ! __eou__ i'd like to apologize for my carelessness . may i clean it up for you ? __eou__ no , i'll do it myself . __eou__ here is my card , sir . could you send me the cleaning bill and i will refund the cost to you ? __eou__ i should think so , too ! __eou__ i'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . __eou__ yes , and please be more careful in the future ! __eou__ i will , sir . i'm really very sorry . __eou__ that's ok .

ok class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? __eou__ the brain ! __eou__ that's right , the brain ! it serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . then what major organ is in our chest ? __eou__ the heart ! __eou__ very good ! it pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! now what about the organs that help us digest food ? __eou__ the stomach and intestines ! __eou__ very good ! let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . are we forgetting anything ? __eou__ yeah ! our kidneys , liver and bladder ! __eou__ oh yes , you are right . very important organs indeed . __eou__ so what do these organs do , teacher ? __eou__ well , mumm , they ... time for a break ! we can talk about it when you get back .
hey stacy . what's going on ? __eou__ i'm pretty tired these days . __eou__ why ? you're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ? __eou__ i have so much house work to do . i have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends . __eou__ how about your husband . does he help much ? __eou__ not at all . he comes home and complains about his hard day at work . he expects me to do everything . he even wants me to feed him sometimes . can you believe that ? __eou__ that sucks . __eou__ if he wasn't so lazy , i think i wouldn't have any complaints . he mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? __eou__ that's crossing the line . __eou__ oh well . i'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? __eou__ yes , i do . i ’ ll walk you there . __eou__ thanks ! __eou__ are you applying to study or work abroad ? __eou__ i want to study abroad . __eou__ what do you want to study ? __eou__ i hope to study english literature . __eou__ have you got your visa yet ? __eou__ not yet . i have an interview with the visa official today . __eou__ i see . is it your first interview ? __eou__ no , i've already been to here for three interviews . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ i was denied a visa ? __eou__ why ? __eou__ like most students . i want to work in america after graduation . __eou__ i see . well , good luck !
guess what came in the mail today ? __eou__ what ? __eou__ my acceptance letter to yale ! __eou__ wow ! congratulation ! when do classes start ? __eou__ freshman orientation is the last week of august , but i want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . __eou__ you ’ re so lucky ! do you have to do many things before you leave ? __eou__ yes . i ’ ll be very busy ! i have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . but first , i want to register for classes . __eou__ when can you do that ? __eou__ well , they sent me their prospectus , so i can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? __eou__ sure . what can you choose from ? __eou__ well , i have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . __eou__ what is your major ? __eou__ i hope to major in english literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . __eou__ what are the fundamental course ? __eou__ in order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , english , philosophy , science and art . __eou__ interesting . that ’ s very different from the chinese education system . __eou__ yes , it is . it ’ s also very different from the british education system . __eou__ really ? __eou__ oh , sure . in british , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha .
what's this then ? __eou__ it's my geography , sir . the map of africa you set us . __eou__ but this should have been handed in last thursday . __eou__ yes , i know , sir . i'm sorry . __eou__ well , what's your excuse then ? __eou__ my mother's been ill and i had to stay at home . __eou__ oh , yes ? __eou__ it's true , sir .
ok . come back into the classroom , class . __eou__ does the class start again , mam ? __eou__ yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . __eou__ oh , breaktime flies . __eou__ come on , baby . it ’ s time now . __eou__ mam , another minute , could i ? __eou__ hurry up , little boy .
i give up ! i simply can't learn french ! __eou__ why do you say that ? i think you're making a lot of progress . __eou__ no , i'm not . i try and try and i still can't speak it very well . __eou__ learning any language takes a lot of effort.but don't give up . why don't we practise those dialogues together ? __eou__ good idea . that might help .
are you an american ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ why don't you speak english ? __eou__ oh , my mother is a german , so i can speak german . __eou__ oh , do you like chinese ? __eou__ yeah , i'm eager to learn chinese , but it is too difficult for me . __eou__ i want to study german . can we exchange lessons ? __eou__ very good . i'd like to do that . __eou__ when will we begin ? __eou__ how about tomorrow night ? __eou__ that's all right .
does she make any sense to you ? __eou__ no . it's all greek to me . __eou__ she's speaking french , not greek . __eou__ i know that . i mean i couldn't understand her at all . __eou__ me neither . all i have to do is study french hard . __eou__ i wish you the best of luck .
are you a newcomer ? __eou__ yeah , this is my first visit here . __eou__ you speak good english , though . __eou__ thanks , but i speak english with a strong german accent . __eou__ but let me tell you , you're doing just fine . i couldn't do half as well as you do when i was learning german.by the way , how long have you been learning english ? __eou__ on and off , for quite a few years .
are you new here ? __eou__ yes , i am . __eou__ is this your first year in college ? __eou__ i actually transferred here from another school . __eou__ which school ? __eou__ i transferred from pcc . __eou__ how do you like it here compared to pcc ? __eou__ i love it here . __eou__ do you like it better here or at pcc ? __eou__ don ’ t get me wrong . i like it here , but pcc is better . __eou__ so , why did you leave pcc ? __eou__ because i got my aa and now i am going towards my bachelor degree .
you must be new . __eou__ as a matter of fact , i am . __eou__ have you just started college ? __eou__ no . i transferred here from a different school . __eou__ what school ? __eou__ i transferred here from pcc . __eou__ do you like it here ? __eou__ i really like it here so far . __eou__ do you like it better here or at pcc ? __eou__ i like pcc better . __eou__ if that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ? __eou__ i graduated and i'am working towards my next degree .
you ’ re new here , right ? __eou__ yes , i am . __eou__ will this be your first year ? __eou__ no , i transferred here . __eou__ what school did you come from ? __eou__ i transferred from pcc . __eou__ why ’ d you transfer here ? __eou__ i wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ is pcc a good school ? __eou__ pcc is great ! __eou__ i hope you enjoy it here . __eou__ thank you very much .
you ’ re ready , right ? __eou__ ready for what ? __eou__ are you ready to transfer tomorrow ? __eou__ yes . i am ready . __eou__ you ’ re not nervous ? __eou__ of course i ’ m nervous . __eou__ what are you most nervous about ? __eou__ i won ’ t know anybody at that school . __eou__ you shouldn ’ t be nervous about that . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ meeting new people is a good thing . __eou__ that ’ s a good way to think about it .
are you new to this school ? __eou__ yes , i ’ m new . __eou__ is this your first year in college ? __eou__ i transferred from another school . __eou__ where did you transfer from ? __eou__ i was at pcc before . __eou__ why did you transfer ? __eou__ i was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . __eou__ did you like it at pcc ? __eou__ pcc is an incredible school . __eou__ well , i wish you luck here . __eou__ i ’ m sure i ’ ll like it here .
you ’ re new here , right ? __eou__ yes , i am new . __eou__ is this your first semester ? __eou__ i just transferred from another school . __eou__ what school did you transfer from ? __eou__ i came here from pcc . __eou__ do you like it here so far ? __eou__ i am really enjoying it here so far . __eou__ which is better , here or pcc ? __eou__ i think pcc is a lot better than here . __eou__ why didn ’ t you just stay at pcc ? __eou__ i graduated and now want to get a ba .
are you new here ? __eou__ this is my first day here . __eou__ are you a freshman in college ? __eou__ i started school somewhere else . __eou__ what school did you transfer from ? __eou__ i started at pcc . __eou__ what made you transfer ? __eou__ my grades weren ’ t good enough to go here . __eou__ did you like pcc ? __eou__ i loved pcc . __eou__ good luck here . __eou__ i ’ m excited to be here .
where are you planning on transferring to ? __eou__ i can ’ t seem to make a decision . __eou__ where do you want to go ? __eou__ i honestly have no idea . __eou__ you haven ’ t thought about it ? __eou__ i like it here at pcc . __eou__ why don ’ t you just continue going to pcc ? __eou__ i like that idea . __eou__ it ’ s a great school . __eou__ i completely agree . __eou__ so , have you made your decision yet ? __eou__ i ’ m staying right where i ’ m at .
you ready ? __eou__ am i ready for what ? __eou__ are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? __eou__ oh . yes , i ’ m ready to transfer . __eou__ you ’ re not nervous , are you ? __eou__ i ’ m very nervous . __eou__ why are you nervous ? __eou__ i ’ m not going to know anybody there . __eou__ that ’ s not a problem . __eou__ that makes me nervous . __eou__ it ’ s fun meeting new people . __eou__ i didn ’ t think about it that way .
have you figured out where you want to transfer to ? __eou__ i can ’ t think of where to go . __eou__ where would you like to go to school ? __eou__ i really don ’ t know . __eou__ you can ’ t think of anything ? __eou__ i really like where i ’ m at now . __eou__ so , why don ’ t you just stay here ? __eou__ that may be what i ’ m going to do . __eou__ it ’ s a perfectly good school . __eou__ you ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? __eou__ i ’ m just going to stay at pcc .
watch out ! you'll hit that car if you're not careful . __eou__ oh no , i won't . but we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . __eou__ you see . i told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . __eou__ oh , shut up , will you ? it was all your fault.if you'd kept quite this would never have happened . __eou__ oh , so it was my fault , was it ? if i hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse .
hey sarah , are you all right ? you look upset . __eou__ as a matter of fact , i am a bit upset . i just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ no one would listen to any of my suggestions . instead , they just kept arguing with each other . __eou__ who was chairing the meeting ? __eou__ bob . __eou__ well , i can tell you from experience that bob might come off a little strong sometimes . __eou__ that's exactly what happened ! he kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . then he expected everyone to agree with him . __eou__ what was the meeting about ? __eou__ we were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . __eou__ it's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient . __eou__ exactly . i had tons of ideas that i wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . what should i have done to get my point across ? __eou__ you have to keep things short and sweet . when you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . __eou__ short and sweet ? but what if i have to explain something complicated ? __eou__ you can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . not everyone needs to know all that information . __eou__ that's a good idea , i think i will try that at the next meeting .
oh , no ! __eou__ how dreadful ! __eou__ look at the view from the window . __eou__ oh , dear . that ’ s terrible . not at all what i expected . __eou__ it ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ i can ’ t bear to look at it . i ’ m rather disappointed . __eou__ it can ’ t be helped .
wow . she can be really nasty , can't she ? __eou__ no . she was right . i was too nervous . i kept thinking , what if we blow it ? __eou__ well , i guess zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . __eou__ she even stayed at a different hotel . she said i might be contagious . __eou__ well , at least we have stars.com . that'll be great publicity .
hi , dave . this is zina . __eou__ zina ? zina the snake ? __eou__ i got your e-mail a couple of months back . __eou__ yeah ? which one was that ? __eou__ the one that said , you're a creep . from me you won't hear another peep . i hope you wreck your jeep . __eou__ right . that one . did it work ?
i'm going for a walk , yi-jun . i need some time to myself . __eou__ don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? this sheet says they are tonight . __eou__ i just can't right now . everyone will be talking about taylor and ... __eou__ ... and maybe that's what we both need . __eou__ i need to come to grips with his death first . and i also need to prepare a eulogy in case i'm asked to speak tomorrow . __eou__ ok , but don't forget i'm here for you , and i know how you feel . it's my loss , too .
hey sandra , what's wrong ? you look furious ! __eou__ i've had it with tim ! i think i'm going to quit ! __eou__ but sandra ... you love your job ! you spent months trying to get this position . it's perfect for you ! __eou__ yeah ... i know . but i'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! __eou__ what kind of power struggles are you talking about ? __eou__ basically , i think tim is threatened by me . i'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! __eou__ so he talks about you behind your back ? __eou__ yes . he's all nice and friendly to my face . but the second i turn around he stabs me in the back ! __eou__ i had a worker like that once . she was always taking credit for my ideas . __eou__ i should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary i can prove it was my effort . __eou__ my co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . she liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday i was chatting with tom . she meant tom solomon ... our ceo .
oh , no . it looks like we're late . __eou__ let's just sit in the back . we can still hear the service from here . __eou__ there're so many people here . where are rich and cath and taylor's parents ? __eou__ they're probably up front . the preacher's about to speak . let's listen . __eou__ that was such a touching speech . he must have really known taylor well . __eou__ oh , how i wish this all wasn't happening !
hurry up ! time is money ! __eou__ don't build a fire under me . i know the importance of time . __eou__ but you are too slow to follow them . __eou__ don't you see i'm trying my best ?
what do you think of the new television channel ? aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ i quite agree with you . they are terrible . they are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ actually , what bothers me is the violence . there are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ i couldn't agree with you more . there aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ you are absolutely right . they are too brief . they don't tell you anything .
wedding rings ! __eou__ oh , no ... __eou__ aren't they cool ? i like the settings . __eou__ jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ? __eou__ no . i just like looking at wedding rings , ok ? __eou__ women are such dreamers . __eou__ these are specially designed for the year 2000 !
here you are at last ! you're half an hour late , you know . __eou__ i'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ my watch stopped and i didn't know . i certainly need to buy a better one .
hi joe . you met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ emm ... yes . but i wasn't too impressed . i found her a little stuck up . __eou__ you are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ tom ... you are her boss , you down . of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ come on . she's like that with everyone . __eou__ i don't think so actually . she never even says " hello " to me .
cheers ! to our first night in our new apartment . __eou__ it's so quiet . i'm not really used to it . __eou__ all you hear is the crickets and the breeze . __eou__ it's a little eerie . i'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . __eou__ well , i think it's fabulous . and the neighbors don't even seem to exist . __eou__ that is a relief . it's a good thing we moved .
i've been standing here since half past seven . where on earth have you been ? __eou__ i'm terribly sorry i'm late . i just couldn't help it . __eou__ it's really very easy saying you're sorry . __eou__ look , just give me a chance . i can explain it .
wow ! what happened to you ? you look sad . __eou__ i just lost my job . my boss just told me . __eou__ that's unbelievable . why did this happen ? __eou__ i don't understand of myself . it seems they have to save money . __eou__ i cant't believe it . you've worked here for years .
harry was angry last night . __eou__ that's because he's getting nervous . anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . __eou__ but he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . it's not like harry to do a thing like that . __eou__ yes , you're right . maybe there's any other reason .
he got the scholarship to harvard . __eou__ you're kidding ! __eou__ it's true . he is a hard worker . __eou__ i know he really deserves this .
i don't like this movie . it's a bomb . __eou__ look , i've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it . __eou__ well , give me the walkman . i'll listen to the music then . __eou__ come on . give it a chance . the movie just started .
my goodness ! what happened ? you have blood on your face . __eou__ oh , don't worry . i just killed a pigeon . __eou__ how could you have the heart to kill it ? we only have one ! __eou__ it spoiled my painting !
thank you so much for coming tonight . everybody really enjoyed your performance . __eou__ i'm glad i could help . __eou__ here's the check . i included a little extra for you . __eou__ you didn't have to do that ! __eou__ i know , but you deserve it .
the boss announces the pay raise today , right ? how much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ no idea . your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ it better be more than last year . __eou__ well , anything is better than nothing . wait and see .
what do you think about violence in movies ? __eou__ personally , i'm not for it . i feel it's bad for kids to watch . __eou__ but kids like watching things like that . it's just for fun , would't you say ? __eou__ if you ask me , i have to disagree . something shouldn't be watched for fun .
i'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . __eou__ i'm not sure i can't agree , dan . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ surely , there are other ways to save money . __eou__ what are you talking about , we tried everything !
i feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . __eou__ great idea ! peter , i could use the drink . __eou__ how about the new bar across the road ? __eou__ sounds good . the food there is fantastic too . __eou__ i agree , i had lunch there last week . __eou__ excellent ! that sounds like a plan .
too much , harry . don't blame her anymore . __eou__ but it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ i know . but there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ i don't care .
you won one million yuan in a lottery . what will you say ? __eou__ i don't know . i'm too excited to say a word . __eou__ i understand . it's too good to be true , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , too good to be true .
when he told me i had to work overtime , that was it . __eou__ the last straw , huh ? __eou__ yes , he's really pushed me too far . __eou__ i know what you mean .
i'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . __eou__ there's no need to apologize . __eou__ but i ruined your rug . __eou__ forget it . it was an accident .
you didn't tell me she was married ! __eou__ i tried . you were preoccupied . __eou__ i got carried away . i made such a fool of myself . they were both laughing at me ! __eou__ you got drunk , and you were hilarious . lighten up . __eou__ that guy was definitely a don . __eou__ so now you can say you had a mafia experience . ha-ha . __eou__ yeah . if i leave little italy alive ... __eou__ are you kidding ? don had fun scaring you . he'd probably buy you dinner if we go back .
is there something wrong ? you look so sad . __eou__ my house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . __eou__ no wonder you look so upset . have you called the police ? __eou__ yes , i have . but i have to wait .
did bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? look ! __eou__ what a creep ! phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . __eou__ no wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! __eou__ you could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want .
hello . i was wondering if taylor smith has checked out yet ? __eou__ just one moment . i'll check with the cancer ward desk . __eou__ the cancer ward ! ? oh , my . it's worse than we thought . __eou__ ma'am , i'm sorry . the cancer ward said mr . smith passed away two days ago . __eou__ that's impossible ! i'm talking about mister taylor smith . __eou__ yes , ma'am . he died from complications of stomach cancer . i'm very sorry . __eou__ i'm really sick !
it seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . __eou__ ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... __eou__ this has been the worst and best day of my life , taylor . they kept you in the hospital , and ... __eou__ i'll tell you all about it another day . __eou__ but you're ok ? it was nothing serious , was it ? __eou__ you ladies look very elegant in black . but i don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ...
you know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? __eou__ why am i always the last to know these things ? __eou__ i sent out a notice . you've stopped checking your e-mail ? __eou__ no , but bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . my mailbox must have been overflowing . __eou__ how obnoxious ! i heard he was sending you dirty jokes . __eou__ he not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the net for even more forwards for him !
you know , taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days . __eou__ and i'm the one who put him there with my football moves . __eou__ but you're not to blame for them keeping him there . __eou__ yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ? __eou__ i'm not sure , but we can find out . i bought some crosswords to keep him busy . __eou__ great , then let's go visit him . i want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry .

i don't know what to say . this can't be happening . here's the obituary . __eou__ it's really there ? this all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__ but it explains why taylor isn't answering and femi took time off from work . __eou__ poor femi . taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__ this says the viewing is at myers funeral home today until five . __eou__ it's already half past four . we should go and pay our respects . taylor's family will be there .
did everyone fill out their entry permits ? __eou__ yes . the videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak english with the flight attendants . __eou__ speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . i wonder why ... __eou__ it'll be the year 2000 ! the flight attendants are coming over here . they're carrying bottles of champagne ! __eou__ that's because it's time . __eou__ time for what ? __eou__ it's time to make our wedding wish come true ... __eou__ you mean get married now ? on the plane ? __eou__ why not ? i've got the rings ready . __eou__ i don't know what to say , jack ! __eou__ hopefully , you'll say " yes " ...

does mr . schmidt know he's going to become a father ? __eou__ no , and i have no way of getting ahold of him ! there's no phone where he's at ! __eou__ well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he ! __eou__ my older sister judy will be here soon to help . she already has a boy and a girl of her own ... __eou__ i just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . is that her ?
what ? i don't get it ... __eou__ many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . he meant that you turned it into a comedy . __eou__ well , i'm glad i made everyone happy . __eou__ he meant it in a good way . you added a little spice to the performance . __eou__ i'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . ha-ha ... __eou__ of course ! that's why i always say , eat , drink and be greek !
kim ! i'm here ! i brought all my old maternity clothes plus dave and alice's baby clothes ! __eou__ it's a little early for those , isn't it ? i still have eight months to go ... __eou__ believe me , the time will fly by ! before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! you have to start preparing ! __eou__ i thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . what do you think about lavender ? __eou__ i'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! you just sit back and relax !

excuse me , supen . __eou__ i hope nothing is wrong . __eou__ please forgive me , but i have to leave . i feel terrible . but ... __eou__ what's the matter ? __eou__ my daughter isn't feeling well . __eou__ oh , no . is it serious ? __eou__ i don't know . will you forgive me ? __eou__ of course . i'm sorry for your daughter . __eou__ thank you . it's our first date . i hope it's not too offensive . __eou__ not at all .

why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village ? __eou__ i think a mountain village is splendid ! __eou__ i don't agree with you . it's too small to live . __eou__ it has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town . __eou__ i disagree , a big town is more lively . __eou__ but i like the small mountain village . the big town is noisy . how charming it is when walking along the hill ! __eou__ well , alright , i agree with you about that , but i still prefer a big town .

how about a movie tonight ? __eou__ it doesn ’ t matter to me . __eou__ does 7 o'clock suit you ? __eou__ either way . i don ’ t care . __eou__ how about a snack after work ? __eou__ i couldn ’ t careless . __eou__ would you rather stay home ? __eou__ whatever you say . __eou__ are you really interested in doing something ? __eou__ i don ’ t mind if you want to .
we ’ re going to the movies . will you join us ? __eou__ i ’ m very sorry i can ’ t . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ i ’ m afraid i have some business to attend to . __eou__ then would you like to have lunch with us ? __eou__ i ’ d love to but i have to help john with his math problems right now . __eou__ would you like me to give you a lift ? __eou__ no , thanks . his home is not far and i can walk there . __eou__ come on . it ’ s no trouble at all . __eou__ ok , thank you .

what's the matter with you then ? you look miserable . __eou__ it's us . __eou__ what do you mean by us . __eou__ well , you always say you're busy . __eou__ that's right . __eou__ and you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . __eou__ i ... i ... i miss my parents , also they miss me . __eou__ oh i remember , i cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . __eou__ you mean i am groaned a few words ? __eou__ totally not . perhaps it's about our marriage .
it may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . __eou__ how did they hear ? no one called . __eou__ in times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . but his whole family was here . __eou__ his mom and dad must be destroyed . he was their only son . __eou__ and he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . __eou__ yes ... thank you for understanding . we have to go now . __eou__ this sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location .
hey , mary , can you cut that out ? __eou__ cut what out i ’ m not doing anything . __eou__ the tapping of your pen on your desk . it ’ s driving me crazy . __eou__ fine ! by the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! __eou__ i don ’ t slurp my coffee . and plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? __eou__ you ’ ve got to be kidding me ! you ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? __eou__ look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . but , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up i ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . __eou__ fine . let's call a truce . i'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . __eou__ yeah , i ’ ll try to do the same . so , i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night ?
i have a problem . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ my mattress was supposed to be delivered today . __eou__ is there a problem ? __eou__ the delivery people showed up four hours late . __eou__ i apologize for their tardiness . __eou__ i was late for work because of them . __eou__ again , i do apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ i want my money back for the delivery . __eou__ seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . __eou__ it shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ i'm going to refund your money right now .
i'm sorry , ladies . mr . smith's viewing is over . it ended an hour ago . __eou__ but we just drove across town . can't we just go in to see him one last ... __eou__ i'm afraid not . but at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service . __eou__ this is all too fast . he's my best friend , and now he's gone . __eou__ i'm sorry . i know it must have come as a great shock . __eou__ the viewing was for saying goodbye , and i didn't even get that .
the mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ me , too , i can ’ t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks . __eou__ do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ no , i forgot to buy some . __eou__ then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ that ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ ve had ! let ’ s do it ! __eou__ run ! they are thirsty for more !
hi , daniel , how are you holding up ? i am greatly sorry for your loss . __eou__ thank you , i ’ m doing much better . i ’ ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . __eou__ how ’ s that going ? __eou__ it ’ s a lot harder than i imagined . there are many things that you have to to arrange . i booked a time and date with the funeral home , but i still have a lot of things to do . __eou__ have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? __eou__ no . wendy is being cremated . she always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . i already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . __eou__ i see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . i am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . you are doing a great job . __eou__ thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters .
dan , dan , dude . you have to come over to my house right now ! __eou__ is everything ok ? __eou__ just get over here ! __eou__ come in ! quickly ! __eou__ so , since when is your house a bank ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . __eou__ security , dan , security ! you can never be too safe you know ! a lot of sickos out there . just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . __eou__ what ’ s the matter with you ? why are you acting all paranoid ? __eou__ paranoid ? i ’ m not paranoid ! i ’ m cautious ! you see dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! people just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! they have way too much information ! i like to keep everything on a need to know basis . __eou__ ok , well , what did you want to see me about ? __eou__ you are being watched ! be careful dan ! be careful !
our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . i ’ ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . __eou__ what ? that would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . __eou__ then what shall i do ? __eou__ call the police .
why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ i didn't like her butting in where i didn't want her . she's a chatter box . __eou__ but she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ i know . but i just can't stand her butting in when i was trying to emphasize a point .
it smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__ hi honey ! what ’ s wrong ? why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__ what ’ s wrong ? i thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__ no ! i said i was going to cut down which is very different . you can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__ look , there are other ways to quit . you can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . we spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . it ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__ i know , i know . i am really trying , but i don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . i can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! please understand ? __eou__ fine ! i want a divorce !
don't cover up your sadness . let it go . __eou__ i'm sorry . __eou__ it isn't your fault . no one will blame you . __eou__ you are so thoughtful .
i think that ’ s settled . __eou__ i'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . who do you think you are ! __eou__ how dare you speak to me like this . __eou__ why not ?
you are blue in the face , arn't you ? __eou__ the cat has eaten my fish , i'll kill it . __eou__ but supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? __eou__ i'll beat him . __eou__ so beat the cat , but don't kill it .
it ’ s really terrible ! __eou__ what are you talking about ? __eou__ don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all . __eou__ you said it . many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children .
what are you thinking about ? __eou__ about my boyfriend . __eou__ again ! __eou__ you are really a wet blanket .
finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . and trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . __eou__ listen , nancy . if i don't work hard , i will be laid off . __eou__ you are passing the buck . i'll be hanged if i ask you to go to the park with us . __eou__ come on , nancy . play it cool . i go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight .

you seem to be in the seventh heaven . what's put you on ? __eou__ sarah and i could see eye to eye with each other . __eou__ did she give up her decision to marry dick ? __eou__ no , i encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart .
you seem to have all the jitters about jane . __eou__ yeah . i am on edge since she was out to the match . __eou__ keep your fingers crossed . she'll bring home the bacon . __eou__ i do have the confidence , but i still worry about her .

lisa wins the first prize in the english speech contest of her college . __eou__ really ? that's really wonderful . i'm so happy for her . __eou__ but i always feel disappointed . i have many problems with english learning . __eou__ honey , cheer up . __eou__ i feel confused about the grammars . __eou__ i'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best . __eou__ and my writing is not good . i feel so frustrated . __eou__ be confident , and never give up . __eou__ i know that , mom . but sometimes i'm just sad . __eou__ keep your chin up . remember ? nothing is impossible to a willing heart . __eou__ yes , mom . you are right . nothing is impossible to a willing heart . i will keep going .
i give up ! i simply can't learn french ! __eou__ why do you say that ? i think you're making a lot of progress . __eou__ no , i'm not . i try and try and i still can't speak it very well . __eou__ learning any language takes a lot of effort . but don't give up . why don't we practise those dialogues together ? __eou__ good idea . that might help .
i don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . __eou__ yeah . li na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a canadian . she's almost driving li na crazy . __eou__ if i were li na , i would ask her if she had done that . __eou__ she a as meek as a lamb . she never goes against anyone or anything . she's as good as gold , you know ?
yuck . the carrots taste awful and salty . hi sis , how do you like them ? __eou__ i like them very much . they are delicious . __eou__ well , you can have all my carrots . __eou__ daniel , hold on for a minute . what are you trying to pull there ? __eou__ nothing . just that i don't care for these carrots.hi , sis . , i saw you buy some chocolate cakes . i am done with the main course . it's about time for some dessert . __eou__ oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! __eou__ no , no , i'm just thinking of some dessert . and i have had enough carrots . __eou__ daniel , carrots contain much vitamin c . it is good for you . __eou__ i know , but chocolate cake is even better . __eou__ oh , stop it ! you know you need vegetables . you will end up fat if you don't watch your diet , now . __eou__ well , actually , i don't mind eating carrots , but chocolate cakes are much better . you know i was born with a sweet tooth .

why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ sorry , i thought you knew . __eou__ but you should have told me you were in love with her . __eou__ didn't i ? __eou__ you know you didn't . __eou__ well , i'm telling you now . __eou__ yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ i didn't think you'd be interested . __eou__ you can't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? __eou__ sorry , i didn't think it mattered . __eou__ oh , you men ! you're all the same .

are you elvin ? __eou__ elvin dixon . who are you ? __eou__ i'm mary . i want to say i really admire the software you're designed . __eou__ easy stuff . but thanks . and the admiration is mutual . __eou__ it is ? __eou__ you're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . and we don't even have a working demo yet . __eou__ i can't take the credit for that . i'm just zina's assistant . she's the pro .
hi , elvin . how are the new programmers i got for you ? __eou__ stay away from me . __eou__ are you still mad about your nose ? how is it ? __eou__ i'm serious , zina . back off . i have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . __eou__ that won't be necessary , elvin . look , i want to apologize for your nose . i'm sorry . __eou__ why are you being so nice to me ? don't think for a second that i trust you .

just remember . the main thing right now is to make sure stars.com is happy . __eou__ right . you're right . but she's just evil . someone should drive a stake through her heart . __eou__ elvin , please . can i count on you to keep your cool for a week , or not ? __eou__ i'm ok . i'll be fine . i'v cool . i'm cold . i'm like ice . she won't know what hit her . __eou__ by the way , how's the nose ? boy , that must have hurt .
how are zina's new programmers working out ? __eou__ i hate to admit it , but they're good . and fast . the filipino kid is a genius . __eou__ so you'll make the stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? __eou__ it'll be close , but we'll make it . __eou__ good . after stars.com starts paying us , we won't need vikam's cash anymore . __eou__ and if we don't need them , we won't need zina , either .
do you think what i did to elvin was out of line ? __eou__ you could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . __eou__ elvin doesn't want any programming help . he wants all the glory for himself . __eou__ you might be right . he does think pretty highly of himself . __eou__ did you hear the names he was calling me ? __eou__ i heard . but did you have to tear out his nose ring ?
there's just one catch . zina asked me to let you know . __eou__ what ? __eou__ she promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the stars.com web site by the end of next week . __eou__ what ! ? it'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! is she crazy ? __eou__ yes , i think she is just a little bit crazy . __eou__ crazy is too kind . insane is more like it . nuts ! wacko ! psycho !
what do you think of the new television channel ? aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ i quite agree with you . they are terrible . they are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ actually , what bothers me is the violence . there are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ i couldn't agree with you more . there aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ you are absolutely right . they are too brief . they don't tell you anything .
i'm afraid i've had a terrible row with my boss . what shall i do ? __eou__ i think you'd better apologize . __eou__ oh , but i can't . it wasn't my fault . __eou__ maybe not , but i advice you to say it was your fault .
all right . but these are black and i don ’ t like black shoes . they ’ re dull . __eou__ well , black is a better color than pink . pink ’ s for girls . __eou__ then why are you wearing black shoes ? __eou__ because ... oh , all right . you win . let ’ s pay for them and go . __eou__ hey , thanks , mum .

what a charming room ! it faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . __eou__ i'm glad you like it.the bell is on the bedside.just ring if you want anything.the room attendant speaks a little english.so i don't think you'll have any trouble . __eou__ no , i shouldn't think so.by the way , is there a socket for my razor ? __eou__ i think so.here it is.it ' s by the basin . __eou__ is it a two-pin socket ? __eou__ yes , it is . __eou__ good , i ' ve get a two-pin plug .

say , jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ what do you mean ? it will help us to relax . __eou__ do you really think so ? i don't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ? __eou__ i guess you are right.but what shall we do ? i don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ that's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play pingpong.perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ sounds great to me ! if they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.that is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ good.let ' s go now . __eou__ all right .
what a terrible house ! __eou__ i'm sick of it , too . __eou__ the door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . __eou__ it's no use complaining . if we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . __eou__ sure .
don ’ t be worried . please sit down and take it easy . __eou__ how could i feel easy ? i ’ m really pissed . __eou__ but you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . __eou__ ok . i ’ ll try my best to calm down first .
hi , cindy . i thought i ’ d missed you . __eou__ oh , i am very sorry , hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already . __eou__ it ’ s all right . __eou__ i was caught in the heavy rain , or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting . __eou__ i was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ? __eou__ yes . when i came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up . __eou__ i totally understand .
hi , becky , what's up ? __eou__ not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ she loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that i do . i can never do anything right when she's around . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there's just nothing can please her . __eou__ no , i can't see that happening . i know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . __eou__ it's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids . __eou__ my mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . if it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . __eou__ you said she used to ? how did you stop her ? __eou__ we basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . she understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . __eou__ that sounds like a good idea . i'll have to try that .
come in , come in ! __eou__ hi , gary , what happened ? i was waiting for you at the theater . why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ i thought we were supposed to meet here . __eou__ don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ i ’ m sorry . we must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ you ’ re right . i am sorry . let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ it ’ s okay . i don ’ t want to go now . we ’ ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . i don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
do you have to leave soon ? __eou__ no . actually i can stay longer . dave called to say that there is a beautiful chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . __eou__ oh , that ’ s better . so you don ’ t have to rush . __eou__ yeah . you know what dave just said ? __eou__ what ? __eou__ he said i should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . __eou__ he knows you very well . __eou__ he always makes fun of me . he always says things like that . you know the new coming teacher , a chinese canadian . he said she would really be my chance . __eou__ i ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . you ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . you must be very popular . __eou__ no , you ’ re kidding . i ’ m not taking it seriously .
sally , i ’ m tired of this western food . i really miss my mother ’ s sichuan cooking . __eou__ i ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can ’ t you try to get used to western food ? __eou__ i have tried . but americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ i suppose you ’ re right , lee . maybe that ’ s why so many westerners are overweight . __eou__ it ’ s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ you see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening .
i ’ m sick of my job , i always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ what do you suggest ? i can ’ t afford to quit my job until i get a new one . __eou__ maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training .
how beautiful the flower is ! __eou__ really , it's so beautiful . __eou__ you like it . well , i'll gather in for you . __eou__ you mustn't pick it in this place . __eou__ where it is ? __eou__ it's a private garden .
they promised us a sea view . __eou__ well , you can just see the sea . between the factory chimneys . __eou__ isn't it awful ? i can't bear to look at it . i don't think i can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ well , it can't be helped . we'll just have to put up with it .
so kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? __eou__ stolen ? no , why ? __eou__ my uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . i was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . __eou__ criminals are clever ? they're only successful when people are careless . __eou__ i don't know . the ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good . __eou__ if your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened . __eou__ he did . it was one of the best ones available . but that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . and on a crowded street too . __eou__ didn't anyone stop them ? __eou__ you would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . no one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . the thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . __eou__ wow , they were good . i guess criminals aren't that dumb after all . __eou__ that's not the end . they were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck .
why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ i don ’ t want to . __eou__ well , come and talk to me then . __eou__ certainly not . __eou__ may i turn on the radio then ? __eou__ turn on the radio ? what for ? __eou__ so that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__ listen to some music ? and who ’ ll cook dinner ? will you ? __eou__ ok , i will . but let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . __eou__ to a disco ? oh , no . you know i hate pop .
mark , you are not telling me the truth . now why ? __eou__ promise you are not going to be angry ? __eou__ yes , all right . so why ? go on then . say it . oh , really , mark . i promise i'm not going to be angry . now why were you late ? __eou__ i forgot . __eou__ you forgot ? you ... __eou__ ah , ah , you promised , and remember ?
ok . come back into the classroom , class . __eou__ does the class start again , mam ? __eou__ yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . __eou__ oh , breaktime flies . __eou__ come on , baby . it ’ s time now . __eou__ mam , another minute , could i ? __eou__ hurry up , little boy .
er ... alison ? __eou__ ohm , hello , marcia . i was ... __eou__ i just wanted to congratulate you ! i mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win . __eou__ well ... thanks , marcia.it ' s very nice of you to say so . i mean ... __eou__ it was that final sprint ! you were great ! really ! __eou__ do you really think so ? i mean , was i ? er ... you ... must be disappointed .

are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ? __eou__ 120 british pounds . but there are still three days left in the auction . if you want it , you'll have to bid . do you have the guts ? __eou__ i'm just asking . it's not like i'd actually make a bid . __eou__ just don't come looking to me for help . __eou__ don't worry . i won't . __eou__ i'm signing off . __eou__ have fun getting ripped off !
on balance , dress designing appeals to me most . __eou__ yes , it's to my liking , too . __eou__ say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? __eou__ it's my dream .

just don't understand why we have to take the subway . look at this place . it's modern enough . but it's far from lively . __eou__ it's convenient . people in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive . __eou__ this isn't network , frida . we are in san francisco . __eou__ what's the difference ? __eou__ we haven't come here in business but for pleasure . we should go out exciting . what can you see in the subway ? nothing ! __eou__ what can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? __eou__ i can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . i can see cars driving on the streets . i can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . i can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . __eou__ but they are not as convenient as the subway . __eou__ you miss the point ! we are not in a hurry to go anywhere . __eou__ well , maybe you are right . we'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway . __eou__ i'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . can we leave this dull place now ? __eou__ what about the tickets ? i've already bought them . __eou__ just throw them away !

could you do me a favor ? __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ could you possibly give me a lift home ? __eou__ all right . __eou__ are you sure ? i don't want to inconvenience you . __eou__ no problem . i'd be happy to . __eou__ thanks . i really appreciate it . thanks so much .

did you see that ? __eou__ no , i missed it . __eou__ how could you miss that ? __eou__ someone was in the way .
susan has been down recently . i saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! __eou__ you have any idea why ? __eou__ she broke up with her boyfriend . __eou__ i heard her boyfriend is married . __eou__ she still loves him . that's why she feels upset . her love is always hard and confusing ... __eou__ then what about you ? how are you getting on with your boyfriend ? __eou__ he sometimes really drives me crazy .
harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone . __eou__ i know only too well what that's like . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i was very sad when i was laid off last year .
when he told me i had to work overtime , that was it . __eou__ the last straw , huh ? __eou__ yes , he's really pushed me too far . __eou__ i know what you mean .
i'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . __eou__ there's no need to apologize . __eou__ but i ruined your rug . __eou__ forget it . it was an accident .
too much , harry . don't blame her anymore . __eou__ but it was her that makes us so embarrassed . __eou__ i know . but there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? __eou__ i don't care .
isn ’ t he the best instructor ? i think * he ’ s so hot . wow ! i really feel energized , don ’ t you ? __eou__ i swear , i ’ m going to kill you for this . __eou__ what ’ s wrong ? didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! __eou__ oh , yeah ! i had a blast ! i love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . sorry , i ’ m just not into this health kick . __eou__ oh , no , get off it . it wasn ’ t such a killer class . you just have to get into it . like they say , no pain , no gain . __eou__ i am wiped out . thank you . __eou__ look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . you ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ never ! but thank you for inviting me . __eou__ come on . you ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers .
are things still going badly with your house guest ? __eou__ it ’ s getting worse . now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . i ’ ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . he makes himself at home , which is fine . but what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and i had company over ! that was the last straw . __eou__ leo , i really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . i know he used to be your best friend in college , but i really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . __eou__ you ’ re right . everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . i ’ ll keep you informed .
would you please put that cigarette out ? i get sick on it . __eou__ you do ? ok , fine with me . __eou__ thank you so much . __eou__ but i also want ya to do me a favor . __eou__ what ? __eou__ you gotta have some better deodorant . __eou__ i ’ m sorry ? !
do you mind if i get a lift in your car , please ? __eou__ i don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old . __eou__ oh you ’ re so kind ! __eou__ get in .
hey , leo . how come you look so terrible ? what ’ s going ’ on ? __eou__ you can say that again . susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so i offered to put him up for a few days . but he ’ s driving me up a wall . this guy is bottomless pit . __eou__ how gross ! i can ’ t handle people like that . does he at least give you a hand around the house ? __eou__ he doesn ’ t lift a finger ! i bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . __eou__ man , what a freeloader . you better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . after all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . __eou__ you think he might stay even longer ? ! __eou__ now , don ’ t go losing your temper . if you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . i know ! tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! __eou__ that wouldn ’ t be a lie !
so , what happened ? __eou__ he never came . __eou__ he stood you up . __eou__ i wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . i think something happened . something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__ not possible . __eou__ maybe , there was a subway accident . __eou__ absolutely . __eou__ a train got trapped underground with him inside . __eou__ and no phone . __eou__ and you know , how those express trains create suction .
if ever you ’ re in chicago , please do look me up . __eou__ well , yes , i ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble . __eou__ no trouble at all . i think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well . __eou__ that ’ d be fine .
i ’ m sorry , but i can ’ t find the book that you lend me . __eou__ oh , that ’ s alright . __eou__ i must apologize . i ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow . __eou__ no . please don ’ t . i couldn ’ t let you do that .
i don ’ t think i can take another semester of this dorm food . __eou__ i know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired . __eou__ sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what i should do is move into an apartment off campus where i can cook for myself . __eou__ have you found anything yet ? __eou__ you know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? __eou__ you should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school . __eou__ i got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem . __eou__ but the parking might be . __eou__ you bet !
i ’ m afraid i spoke in all of the table clock . __eou__ never mind about that . __eou__ i ’ m terribly sorry , won ’ t you let me pay for ? __eou__ no , i won ’ t hear of it .
would you mind doing something for me ? __eou__ i would if i could . __eou__ would you please explain the meaning of the word ? __eou__ yes , with pleasure .
oh , this is the famous emperor palace building . __eou__ it ’ s huge . __eou__ would you like to go to the top ? __eou__ yes , of course . __eou__ the view is breath-taking .

adam . i ’ m sorry . __eou__ where have you been , alice , you're over an hour late . __eou__ yes , but i couldn ’ t help it . i was late getting off work for a start and then i miss the bus . the bus i did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . it was one thing after another . __eou__ why ere you getting off work so late ? the office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ yes . but those are the rush in that moment . and my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? __eou__ well , no . i thought i ‘ ve finish in five minutes . and i didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if i hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic i wouldn ’ t have been so late . i ’ m sorry . __eou__ well . you ’ re here .
this is a nice set of wheels . how much did the dealer charge you for this ? __eou__ a lot . i probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . come on , get in . let ’ s take a drive . __eou__ okay then , let ’ s go fast ! whoa ! this thing can really accelerate fast . __eou__ check out what happens when i put on the brakes suddenly . it can stop quickly . __eou__ hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . you know you tend to go fast ? __eou__ yes , i know it . i went through my last set of tires fast . i even had three flat tires in two weeks . __eou__ now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . __eou__ cut out , would you ?
you should have seen the line at the housing office.it took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . have you made yours yet ? __eou__ no , i ’ m not sure i ’ m going to . __eou__ why not ? there ’ s not much time left . are you short of cash ? __eou__ no , thanks . i am okay . __eou__ you ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next september ... __eou__ well , actually , i am thinking about living off campus . __eou__ do you have any idea how much that would cost ? __eou__ i know it would be more expensive . i think i could handle it though . it ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that i can ’ t get anything done . __eou__ you should study in the library the way i do . think of the money you ’ d save . __eou__ i ’ ve got to think it over some more . __eou__ i hope you will have second thoughts .
so , this is the worst story i ’ ve heard this month . you have my real sympathy , tim . __eou__ you know , all i was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . __eou__ i understand how you feel , but you ’ ve gotta learn to move on . __eou__ yeah , i ’ m dealing with it . anyway . thank you , mike .
god , i didn ’ t realize . i didn ’ t , i didn ’ t know ... __eou__ ... who you were with ? i didn ’ t know whom you were with . __eou__ excuse me ? __eou__ sorry , it ’ s from the godfather . it ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes tom higgins had emissary of vito corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and aaal ! never mind . __eou__ you were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? you probably rented those children . __eou__ why would i spy on you ? __eou__ because i am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . __eou__ the entrance to our store is around the corner . and there ’ s no other way of saying that . it ’ s not the name of our store . it ’ s where it is . and you do not own the phrase around the corner . __eou__ what is that ? what are you doing ? you ’ re taking all the caviar ! that caviar is a garnish ? __eou__ look , the reason i came into your store is because i was spending the day with annabell and matt . and i was buying them presents . i ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . and there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . that will not always be the case . and it was yours . and it is a charming little bookstore . you probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year .
you must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? __eou__ don ’ t ever mention him . i ’ m getting over it . __eou__ it ’ s a sad thing . i ’ m ever so sorry ... __eou__ are you done ?
i ’ ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there . __eou__ are you nuts ? what would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ? __eou__ but that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work . __eou__ oh this is hard ! well , i ’ ll see what i can do .
hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing ! __eou__ oh you ’ re exaggerating . i ’ m never really good at making hairdo . __eou__ you did it yourself ? wow , you are good ! __eou__ thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise . __eou__ he ’ s just got no idea of how good you are .
i just got laid off . the awful business , you know . __eou__ i ’ m very sorry to hear about that . so are you all right ? __eou__ yeah , i ’ m better after talking to you . __eou__ oh , you poor thing !
how many orders do we still need to pack , gale ? we've been packing all day . __eou__ we still have to do about ten more . __eou__ well . i am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . and it's about time to clock out . __eou__ i know . maybe we can finish it tomorrow . __eou__ why not ! these orders are not urgent . we could do it first thing tomorrow morning __eou__ all right . let's call it quits and go home . __eou__ see . great minds think alike .
many congratulations on your winning the game . __eou__ that ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special . __eou__ you were doing great out there ! __eou__ well , actually it ’ s just about luck .
how's your new work , carl ? __eou__ a tough job . they even offer in-service training every wednesday afternoon . __eou__ good for you . __eou__ i don't like it . i am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . above all , i hate talking to those poker faces everyday . __eou__ well , you have to take the bad with the good . __eou__ i guess so . i am badly off and i need this job .
sorry , i overslept . my alarm clock didn't go off this morning . __eou__ again ? __eou__ that's right , even though i did set the alarm last night . __eou__ your clock never works . perhaps you should buy a new one . __eou__ well . if it breaks down again tomorrow , i'll definitely buy a new one . __eou__ maybe by then it will be too late . __eou__ what do you mean too late ? __eou__ by that time , you will be fired .
would you like to see our new shirts ? __eou__ sorry , but i ’ m not really that interested in those things . __eou__ well , they are very nice you know . __eou__ really ? __eou__ and not expensive either . __eou__ oh , i don't care about that . __eou__ everybody is buying them . __eou__ are they ? __eou__ yes , they are very fashionable , you see . __eou__ i am afraid i am not interested in fashion . __eou__ i see . __eou__ but thank you very much all the same . __eou__ sorry i couldn't help you .
stop running around in front of the tv , will you ? why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? __eou__ i've tried , but i can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . __eou__ then stay away . nobody's keeping you from doing that . __eou__ don't be so irritable . i just don't understand the program , that's all . __eou__ all right , i will explain it to you later on . now scram . __eou__ ok . i will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . __eou__ that's exactly what i want , thank you .
you spoken english is pretty good . please tell me your experience in learning english . __eou__ uh , i don't know what to say . what do you want to know ? __eou__ what's your method of learning ? __eou__ let me think a minute . i think i always try to take every chance to practice . __eou__ what if there is no chance ? i mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? __eou__ well , i talk to myself . that is , i play one role first , then the other . __eou__ that's a good idea . you are really creative .
i've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . i wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? __eou__ oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . __eou__ i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? __eou__ surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little english . __eou__ you mean you didn ’ t know much english then ? __eou__ right . i only knew a few english sentences . __eou__ that's incredible . could you tell me what you did to make a start ? __eou__ first , i worked as a servant . __eou__ really ? i wish you could tell me more about your experience . __eou__ i'd like to , but i must run to a meeting .
how's your new car ? __eou__ perfect ! couldn't be better . __eou__ you made a good choice , then ? __eou__ it's just what i want . __eou__ no regrets . __eou__ i am really pleased with it . __eou__ i am glad you are happy . __eou__ it's super .
i wish i knew who had moved our flower pots . __eou__ it was me . i am so sorry . __eou__ what did you think you were doing ? __eou__ i had to move it , so that i can get my bike through . __eou__ how dare you be so inconsiderate ? that's wrong . __eou__ i am awfully sorry . i didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ never do that again . __eou__ i promise .
why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? __eou__ i don't want to . __eou__ well , come over and talk to me then . __eou__ certainly not . __eou__ may i turn on the tv then ? __eou__ turn on the tv for what ? __eou__ so that we can sit down together and listen to some music . __eou__ listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner , will you ? __eou__ i will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . __eou__ to a disco ? oh , no . you know i hate it .

eric , how long will you be in china ? __eou__ i don't know . well , my contract here is for one year , and i don't know what i should do after that . maybe going around for a while . __eou__ well , have you ever thought about learning some chinese ? __eou__ actually , i am learning that now . but it's too hard for me . you know the four tones and the stuff . it really freaks me out . __eou__ don't worry . all things are difficult before they are easy . __eou__ you hit the nail right on the head . __eou__ well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ it's where i teach you chinese , and in exchange you teach me english . __eou__ awesome . i've been giving this a lot of thought . when can we do this ? __eou__ how about this sunday ? __eou__ ok , cool . __eou__ good . i'll give you a call tonight . __eou__ no problem . __eou__ bye .
why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? __eou__ sorry , i thought you knew . __eou__ but you should tell me you were in love with her . __eou__ didn't i ? __eou__ you know you didn't . __eou__ well , i am telling you now . __eou__ yes , but you might have told me before . __eou__ i didn't think you would be interested . __eou__ you can't be serious . how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? __eou__ sorry , i didn't think it mattered . __eou__ oh , you men ! you are all the same .
david , why don't you clean your room ? __eou__ i am not in the mood . __eou__ why are you feeling depress ? __eou__ i was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . it's a real letdown . __eou__ i don't think she would do such a thing . __eou__ but she did and it made me disappointed . __eou__ oh , cheer up ! a girlfriend is not everything . __eou__ but she means a lot to me . __eou__ then forgive her mistake . __eou__ oh , i just can't forget it .
the concert was really great . __eou__ i agree . __eou__ the singing group used to be very popular . __eou__ i can't believe they would play so good .
thanks for lunch . it was delicious . __eou__ it's ok . __eou__ next time lunch is on me . __eou__ don't be silly . __eou__ i'm serious . __eou__ all right . next time you will treat . __eou__ it's a deal .
good morning . phyllis seymour speaking . __eou__ hi , ms . seymour ? it ’ s allan parker . i ’ ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . __eou__ thank you very much , mr . parker . but , that is my job . __eou__ well , i want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! you ’ re a hard worker !
hey ! that food was terrific . i can't eat another bite . are you sure you don't want another dish ? __eou__ no , i'm full . my stomach isn't growling at me any more . __eou__ i know what you mean . i'm so full that i can burst . shall we go then ? __eou__ i'm all set . thank you for the dinner , jack . __eou__ you are welcome .
philip , i was really glad to hear about your award . congratulations ! __eou__ thanks , denise . actually , i was really surprised . i mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there . __eou__ sure . but the work you did was really exceptional ! you definitely deserved it ! __eou__ thanks a lot . i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . you ’ ve been doing some great work !
have you followed the value of dollar lately ? __eou__ how could i help but follow it ? the fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! the exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . __eou__ it's really frustrating , isn't it ? i have the same problem . i would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . with the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__ every day i have less money ! i haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__ what we really should be making investment in is the euro . i've followed the euro's progress over the last quarter , i think it's about time to buy in . __eou__ what about the yen ? __eou__ are you kidding ? the yen is in worse shape than the dollar !
this is today ’ s schedule . at eight thirty , conference with the department managers . at 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives . __eou__ that ’ s great . what are the prizes ? __eou__ 3000 rib as bonus for each person . __eou__ to encourage the staff increases . __eou__ ok . next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 am . at 12 am , back here for lunch . __eou__ what about the afternoon ? __eou__ at 2 pm , give a presentation here with the press . at four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with mr . smith , manager of ncc .
hi , lander . what's wrong ? __eou__ i can hardly make ends meet these days . __eou__ same here . i have't brought any new clothes for three months . __eou__ my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . __eou__ true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . __eou__ definitely . i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
do you have s second ? __eou__ sure . what do you want ? __eou__ i want to tell you i've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? why ? __eou__ i've been thinking about this for several months , well before the spring festival holidays . __eou__ and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__ yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , i want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . i've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and i still haven't received a pay rise . it's unfair . __eou__ absolutely . with your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__ that's exactly why i decided to quit the job and find a new one .
the band is pretty good . how do you like the music ? __eou__ it's very nice . i haven't heard live music in a while . this is fun . __eou__ well , then , may i invite you for the next dance ? __eou__ of course . but i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer ... __eou__ don't worry . i'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__ you're dancing so well . __eou__ you dance beautifully too . __eou__ when did you learn to dance ? __eou__ in college . but i don't dance very often . what's your favourite dance ? __eou__ it's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz .
excuse me . in this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures . __eou__ is that right ? i didn't know it . __eou__ will you give me your camera ? we have to confiscate your film . __eou__ will you forgive me . could you return my camera ? __eou__ we will keep and return it later . __eou__ oh , i see . then , can i buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? __eou__ you can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit .
i don't know how they do it ! our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . there is no way will be able to compete against that . we're barely breaking even with the present prices . __eou__ these price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . if they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . __eou__ profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . how do they keep their price so low ? __eou__ we can try to lower our cost of production then . we need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . __eou__ you really think we can make it ? i don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . we're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down .
hello , is this the abc company ? __eou__ yes , may i help you ? __eou__ we have just arrived from tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . all of above , we cannot find it . __eou__ what is your reservation number ? __eou__ our reservation number is j - 221 . __eou__ let me see . oh , yes , we have your reservation number . __eou__ you mean you haven ’ t arranged any car ? __eou__ i ’ m sorry to say no . __eou__ here i ’ ll take taxi instead , how do you refund us ?
are you working overtime again ? over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! your company is draining the life out of you ! __eou__ i know , but i don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . i haven't made it out of the office before 9 pm a single day this week . __eou__ well , i hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... __eou__ no , not exactly , i'm working for minimum wage.and they don't give extra pay for overtime . overtime is our own time . __eou__ what ? ! isn't there a law against that , i think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . you should know your rights ! if you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__ they do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . they give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__ that's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__ i would , but i'm afraid i would't be able to find another job . i don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that i'm qualified for . __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now !
excuse me ! i don't have time to waste . i've been here almost one full hour ! __eou__ sorry , madam . you have to wait your turn . the parking lot is full . __eou__ unbelievable ! parking in this city is such a nightmare ! __eou__ madam , patience is a virtue . __eou__ oh , gosh ! i have to go to the restroom so bad ! i can't bear it anymore ! __eou__ i'm sure a spot will open up soon . __eou__ oh , look ! there's a spot open next to the public restroom ! can i take it ?
oh , my god ! __eou__ what ! __eou__ that's the cutest little doll i've ever seen in my life ! __eou__ chill out . it's just kenny from south park . __eou__ what park ? you found a doll in a park ? gross ! __eou__ south park is a popular cartoon . you're so out of it , jen __eou__ well , don't blame me ! i never get a chance to watch tv .
what's that ? __eou__ it's a surprise ! __eou__ for me ? __eou__ yes . let's go inside and you can open it up . __eou__ wow ! it's big ! what could it be ? __eou__ i'll give you two clues . first , it cost more than $ 250 . and second , it's not big , but fat . __eou__ what does that mean , not big but fat ? you didn't buy ...
and lightweight , too . it'll play for 20 hours on two aa batteries ! __eou__ cool ! the sound is great . these earphones are awesome ! __eou__ and they're really safe . they'll protect your ear from sound damage . __eou__ you certainly need that . you always pump the volume up way too high . __eou__ i know . and you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . __eou__ you're right ! so i can listen to music while riding my motorbike !
mary ? are you still there ? __eou__ yes . what do you want ? __eou__ did your bid win ? __eou__ what do you care , dork ? __eou__ hey ! i'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! did you get the statue or not ? __eou__ you mean fat boy ? __eou__ sorry . i take that back . i mean the copper buddha you wanted .
maybe you'll get another chance at the statue . __eou__ i don't think so . did you ever go and look at your stamp ? __eou__ and let them ruin my life ? forget it ! __eou__ but you've been looking for that stamp for years . __eou__ it's not worth it . besides , i have to save up to pay for some bills . __eou__ bummer . i guess we're both out of luck . __eou__ yeah . well , i'll see you this weekend .
how do you get along with your co-workers ? __eou__ i get along pretty well with most of them.it seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , like margaret . i don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.she ' s a terrible gossip . __eou__ do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ? __eou__ it's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.she ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , i think she's nuts . __eou__ so how do you develop good relationships in the office ? __eou__ i think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.if you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with . __eou__ i think you're right , but it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others .
i always think everybody looks down on me __eou__ don't be that negative . __eou__ how can you be optimistic ? you can see it in their eyes . __eou__ i find it there is no meaning in living this world . __eou__ don't be that negative . __eou__ really , life is so boring .
i can't wait until my car is repaired . the commuting with public transportation is killing me . __eou__ it can't be that bad . __eou__ but it is ! take this morning for example . the subway was so packed this morning , i got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . __eou__ at least the subway is better than the bus . it's faster for one thing . and usually less crowded . but the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . it adds up over time , if you take it every day . __eou__ that's true . the bus is even worse . just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! hey , how do you get to work every day ? __eou__ i ride my bike . i don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . __eou__ i'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . __eou__ yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . while you're stressed out by your commute , i'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine .
did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? __eou__ today is so hot , besides i had so much housework to do . my friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . i didn ’ t forget , but i had no time at all . __eou__ so you didn ’ t . is that right ? __eou__ yes . i ’ m sorry . __eou__ why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? why would chinese answer questions this way ? i simply asked if you did it or not . it ’ s a very simple question . and chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . __eou__ yes , i ’ m sorry . i know it bothers you very much . but i don ’ t know why chinese sometimes would do this . __eou__ you know , today i asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . it ’ s a rule i made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . the funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . __eou__ but you know if he brought it or not , right ? __eou__ yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , i was in a hurry ... whatever .
i ’ m sick of my job , i always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . __eou__ why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? __eou__ what do you suggest ? i can ’ t afford to quit my job until i get a new one . __eou__ maybe you have two choices . you could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training .
would you go to the bookstore with me ? __eou__ it sounds a good idea . let ’ s go . __eou__ do you know jeffery has published his second detective novel ? __eou__ yes . i heard about that . and i know you want to buy it , but i ’ m not interested in detective novels . __eou__ so what are you interested in ? __eou__ magazines about fashions , such as cosmo polian . __eou__ i know that magazine . it ’ s very popular . __eou__ yes . i can lend you some . __eou__ thank you . but i ’ m not interested .
i prefer potatoes to eggplants . __eou__ i feel eggplants are more nutritious . __eou__ but as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . __eou__ oh , that's how you see it .
hi , becky , what's up ? __eou__ not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ she loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that i do . i can never do anything right when she ' s around . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there's just nothing can please her . __eou__ no , i can't see that happening . i know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . __eou__ it's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids . __eou__ my mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . if it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ thanks , june . but i think i need to be certified as a mechanic before i ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ that ’ s not a big problem . there are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ i guess i never thought of that before . __eou__ and you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ wow , you ’ ve inspired me to do something !
i think you should look over these figures again . there are some calculations that are a bit off . __eou__ i apologize . this should not have to be this way . __eou__ apology is accepted . try to do better next time . __eou__ of course , i should have been more careful . i ’ m sorry .
she is really pretty , isn't she ? her skin looks so baby-smooth ! __eou__ well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . actually , natural beauty comes from within . __eou__ ah , i can smell jealousy in the air . __eou__ she has nothing that deserves my jealousy . i don't have to put things on my face and i still look pretty . don't you think so ? __eou__ yeah , right . but what did you put on your face last night ? those little greenish things . __eou__ they are cucumbers . they are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.haven ' t you heard them say on tv that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? __eou__ yeah , yeah , yeah ! they wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . blah , blah ... see , i can even recite it . __eou__ that's right . you have learned a lot , haven't you ?
look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . every time i go through my book of business cards , i will notice it . it is an eye-catching one . __eou__ wow , fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal . __eou__ yes , it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__ i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
you must like negotiating a lot . people are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ ha , i am flattered . actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works . __eou__ i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice . __eou__ well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ ok , as john after kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .
did you remember to bring back that software i lent to you ? __eou__ oh , i ’ m sorry . it completely slipped my mind . __eou__ that ’ s ok . if you could just bring it in tomorrow , i would appreciate it . __eou__ definitely , i ’ m really sorry .
you look really wiped out ? __eou__ i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office . __eou__ not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__ i can ’ t believe it . i guess i ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight .
did you punch in ? __eou__ yes . by the way , you are having a great make-up today . i like the color of your lipstick . so adorable ! __eou__ really ? it took me really a while to find the color . i am happy you like it . __eou__ well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? __eou__ sure , when those never ending meetings .
henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? __eou__ no , i'm not clear . __eou__ we've spent $ 1,000 . __eou__ don't make a fuss.the price is rising
how delicious ! tender and crisp ! __eou__ this is the specialty of our restaurant , sir . __eou__ yes , it's really savory . __eou__ thank you for appreciating it .
this is the best dinner i've ever had . __eou__ how about the soup ? __eou__ i've never tasted anything better . __eou__ how nice of you to say so .
what a pin-up she is ! __eou__ can you imagine she's over forty ? __eou__ that's incredible ! she has such a sharp figure . __eou__ absolutely.she ' s a teacher of aerobics .
what upsets you ? __eou__ my parents called . as usual , they reminded me again that i should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . easier said then done . who should i marry ? i have no time to go on a date . __eou__ it is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ i will find one myself , of course . i ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ you mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , i hate that idea . __eou__ no , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . i know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . you can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ i don ’ t think it makes sense . three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ i think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ anyway , i don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ don ’ t worry . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . but all in all , it is more serious and professional . the chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ i don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . i ’ m not knowing who is reading it .
let me clear away the broken glass . __eou__ no , i can manage it myself.just sit down , please . __eou__ it's very careless of me to have broken your glass . __eou__ never mind .
she's pretty and meek . __eou__ no , i can't agree with you . she's one but not the other . __eou__ what makes you think so ? __eou__ she's my wife , you know .
look out ! __eou__ what's it ? __eou__ you must have rolled over something just now . __eou__ what you said gives me the creeps !
what a terrible house ! __eou__ i'm sick of it , too . __eou__ the door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! __eou__ it's no use complaining.if we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it !
mrs.smith , time has stood still with you ! __eou__ thank you.you ' re partial . __eou__ i'm not flattering you.you ' re full of energy every day . __eou__ it's nice to hear that anyway .
i'm scared that she might not come back . __eou__ no , i don't think she's that strong-minded . __eou__ but she took her luggage away with her . __eou__ she will be back soon.you can wait and see .
i'm worried sick that she might leave me one day . __eou__ i'll teach you how to keep her . __eou__ tell me , please . __eou__ after you've solved this problem for me .
boy ! what a beauty ! i fall in love with her at the first sight . __eou__ the beauty under the tree ? __eou__ of course.no girl is more charming . __eou__ she is a young man !
i hear little bob has recovered . __eou__ that's a great relief . i was worried about him . __eou__ the operation was very successful . __eou__ his parents must feel very happy .
i feel pity for the old man . __eou__ i feel the same way . __eou__ it must be dreadful to grow old . __eou__ it sure is.he has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed .
to be frank , i find philosophy rather boring . __eou__ to tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . __eou__ how could you manage to pass the exam ? __eou__ it is still a mystery to me .
crazy ! he locked himself in the room . __eou__ i think he was locked in it . __eou__ but you can see the key in his hand through the window ! __eou__ what a strange guy !
do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? __eou__ no , i'm scared of cats . __eou__ oh , but why ? __eou__ i feel they're dirty .
how do you feel about the tv series ? __eou__ oh , to be frank , i think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . __eou__ yes , i agree , but still a lot of people watch it . __eou__ but i don't think much of it .
every teacher likes him . __eou__ they say he can sum up like winking . __eou__ how he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . __eou__ maybe he's gifted in that .
oh , please ! don't be so old-fashioned ! it's totally safe . __eou__ i sure hope you didn't trust anyone with your credit card number . __eou__ all i did so far was make a bid on the buddha . it was easy ! __eou__ easy ? ha ! ! it was easy for them to cheat you ! ! __eou__ oh , come on ! i just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . and my name , of course .
how much did you bid ? __eou__ eighty-five dollars . if my bid is the highest after three more days , i win ! it's fun ! __eou__ we'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! __eou__ but they won't ! i checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . __eou__ what if he had his friends fake the reviews ? __eou__ you are so paranoid ! not everybody is a crook , you know .
i am so glad i caught you at home . i need your help ! __eou__ what's up , robert ? __eou__ cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... i can't keep them all straight ! __eou__ slow down . what are you talking about ? __eou__ it's about a girl . no , an angel ! i'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
but the auction is a blast ! and i haven't even told you the best part yet ! __eou__ i don't care what the best part is . whatever you say won't change my mind . i'm not buying anything ! __eou__ that stamp you've been looking for is for sale . __eou__ the 1879 large dragon ? are you serious ? how much ? __eou__ hey ! i thought you weren't interested ! sorry , i've gotta go ! i'm going to switch over to ebay and see if my bid is still the highest .
the great wall is a great attraction for visitors . __eou__ it's a man-made wonder . i've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . __eou__ someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . __eou__ that's true .
i'm so glad i bought this watch ! __eou__ cool ! flashy red lines ! __eou__ i think this is the coolest watch i've ever owned . __eou__ is it waterproof ? __eou__ isn't that a silly question ? you know how much of an athlete i am . __eou__ uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? __eou__ well , surfing , scuba diving ...
what's that ? __eou__ it's my new pendant . do you like it ? __eou__ is that hello kitty ? __eou__ yes , in a monkey suit . it's adorable ! __eou__ is it real gold ? __eou__ yeah . two-toned , white and yellow .
let's skip the x-files tonight , fran . okay ? just this once ? __eou__ let me guess . you want to watch the history channel again ! __eou__ how did you know ! there's a program on ancient egypt tonight . __eou__ well , i guess i could tape the x-files and watch it later ... __eou__ look , it's starting ! __eou__ mysteries of the pyramids . didn't we watch this program last week ?
wow ! that ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive . __eou__ yeah , it is ! why is it so expensive ? __eou__ it ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . __eou__ i don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money . __eou__ anyhow , this dress is really elegant .
hi , mary ! you're here already . where's harry ? __eou__ he isn't a punctual person . we may have to wait for a little while . __eou__ that should give us time for a cup of coffee . i'll go and get some . __eou__ make it three cups . here comes harry .
i'll never ever work together with him ! __eou__ what happened ? quarrel again ? __eou__ will you take my materials back from him for me ? please ! __eou__ don't ask me . i don't wanna be involved in your quarrel .
your daughter will be back soon . i'm going to start making dinner . you can just watch some tv in tv room if you like . we just bought a new tv with a lcd screen . the remote control is on the coffee ta __eou__ would you mind if i helped out in the kitchen instead ? i do enjoy cooking . __eou__ this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . __eou__ cooking makes me feel relaxed . so , what are we cooking ? __eou__ ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . here's the recipe . do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? __eou__ sure . we should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . __eou__ that's a good idea . can you set the oven to 200 degrees celsius ? __eou__ that's a bit high for lasagne . i'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . __eou__ fine . i'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . __eou__ you know , i could do this myself . why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? __eou__ i don't think it's broken . __eou__ well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! __eou__ fine . i'll go vacuum . let me know if you need any other help .
isn't it wonderful walking here ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us . __eou__ yes , look over there . that's the empire state building . my book says it's 102 stories tall . __eou__ it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? __eou__ you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__ what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue ? __eou__ quite a number . actually every skyscraper has a history . a few blocks ahead we'll see st.patrick ' s cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed rockefeller center . it's a landmark __eou__ what's there after that ? __eou__ well then , there's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . __eou__ what are all they for ? __eou__ most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places .
what do you think about this store ? i heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities . __eou__ i love this store . the only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . __eou__ don ’ t worry . i ’ ve decided that for your birthday i ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . __eou__ really ? i thought you hated shopping ? __eou__ i do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! __eou__ sure . that ’ s really nice of you . let ’ s go in and try some things on . __eou__ how about this red dress ? i think it would really suit you . __eou__ that ’ s gorgeous ! do they have it in a size 8 ? __eou__ here you go.on any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . __eou__ i think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . do they have the same dress in white ? __eou__ let me look . let ’ s see ... they ’ ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . here you are . __eou__ this is perfect ! what do you think ? __eou__ i think you look fantastic . happy birthday ! __eou__ i ’ m so lucky . you only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! thanks honey !
mom , i just finished my paper . can you proofread it before i hand it in ? __eou__ sure , let ’ s take a look . sweetie , this is terrific . your ideas are so original . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ i can tell you worked hard on it . __eou__ i really did ! i started thinking about what i wanted to say three weeks ago . __eou__ well , it was definitely worth all the time . __eou__ let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees .
howdy ! nice car ! what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ i don ’ t know ! this stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . luckily , i managed to start it up and drive it here . what do you think it is ? __eou__ not sure yet.how about you pop the hood and we can take a look . mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . __eou__ what do you mean ? my daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . it ’ s brand new ! __eou__ well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . you overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . you should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . __eou__ ugh ... so how long is this going to take ? an hour ? __eou__ i ’ m afraid a bit more than that . we need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . you are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . __eou__ what ! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping ? this is not happening !
hey , your chinese is coming along ! __eou__ you think ? __eou__ yeah . it ’ s a lot better than mine . __eou__ but i still get stuck on the different tones.it drives me crazy . __eou__ hang in there . it ’ ll all come together one of these days .
let ’ s cross here . __eou__ you ’ re kidding . we ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! let ’ s cross at the light . __eou__ now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street . __eou__ if you want to cross here , be my guest . i don ’ t feel like dodging cars and scooters !
driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind . __eou__ yeah . i think so.you have to be patient and careful . __eou__ so i'd rather walk or run to work . __eou__ you must be joking !
what's all this noise about ? __eou__ they're discussing whether they should replace miss smith , the music teacher . __eou__ why ? __eou__ because she's not responsible enough .
do you like playing tennis ? __eou__ i don't find it very exciting . __eou__ maybe you haven't found the magic . __eou__ i can't wait !
i'm really sick of waiting for a bus . __eou__ yeah.especially when you have something urgent to do . __eou__ but a taxi costs too much . __eou__ that's true .
i'm tired of dancing . __eou__ but to me it's really enjoyable . __eou__ maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners . __eou__ maybe so .
i find beijing opera is quite a bore . __eou__ young people enjoy pop songs more . __eou__ it's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . __eou__ but you don't have such a problem as to pop songs .
what a bother having to climb storeys home every day . __eou__ but it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health . __eou__ i don't care ! __eou__ you're complaining again .
is there anything wrong with your food this evening , miss ? __eou__ sorry to trouble you . but i don't think this fish is fresh . it actually tastes a bit off . __eou__ sorry , miss . i'll place it immediately , can i get you another drink , or you wait ? __eou__ no , please don't do that . i'd just like to return it . __eou__ i'm sorry , miss , but i'm afraid we can't do that . you'll order something else instead . i'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty . __eou__ ok , then please bring me the steak mediun-rare , thank you . __eou__ ok , miss . i hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner .
bother the flies ! __eou__ where do they come from ? __eou__ i don't know . something rotten here ? __eou__ i can't see it .
can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , i really like you . i'd like to take a relationship to the next level . __eou__ so what are you trying to say to me ? __eou__ it feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . it seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . __eou__ how should i say it ? __eou__ i don't want to be like this . i think we should get step further . __eou__ it has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . we are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ last week i saw brain kissing you on the cheek . __eou__ it was only the cheek . __eou__ that is ok , then ? starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . __eou__ oh , that is ridiculous . __eou__ so is it ok if i kiss other women on the cheek ? __eou__ definitely not . __eou__ you see , we still have hurdle .
what do you think of being a secretary ? __eou__ i'm not at all keen on that sort of job.it makes me crazy . __eou__ how come ? __eou__ you have to type all day .
that woman is a thorough drag ! __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ she keeps spitting on the ground . __eou__ maybe there's something wrong with her .
i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on friday , but i really can't decide what to do . __eou__ what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ? __eou__ not bad , any other ideas ? __eou__ well , there is a play on campus this weekend . __eou__ good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ what's the matter with these ideas ? __eou__ they are good , but i still need a few more . __eou__ what about going on a picnic ? __eou__ cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? __eou__ you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ? __eou__ they are all good .
do you like our new history teacher ? __eou__ i'm fed up with his endless talking . __eou__ you can't say that ! he's a very knowledgeable person . __eou__ i can't see it .
i am really impressed with your presentation skills . __eou__ thank you . i have been working on it for several years . __eou__ well , your time has been well spent ! __eou__ it also helps that i have strong team members , such as yourself . you really know your stuff ! __eou__ thanks , but i have to admit i am really good at bluffing !
rock music really leaves me cold . what about you ? __eou__ i'm crazy about it.it makes me very excited . __eou__ then tell me what's good about it . __eou__ it can't be expressed by words .
i ’ m miss sherman . what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ well , apparently i ’ ve run up quite a bill . i was under the impression that the junior executive holiday package only cost 250 dollars per night . i ’ ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do __eou__ that ’ s true . for the junior executive room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500 __eou__ but i definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 . __eou__ the advertised rate is based on double occupancy . __eou__ when i booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . and the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that . __eou__ are you quite sure ? __eou__ yes . have a look . __eou__ i see . i had no idea our advertising was so misleading . it is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page . __eou__ perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate . __eou__ normally i couldn ’ t do that . but under the circumstances , i ’ ll see what i can arrange.customer satisfaction is our primary aim . __eou__ thank you .
your search on this project has been excellent . __eou__ thank you . i couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team . __eou__ the final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . i think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client . __eou__ well , i hope the client feels the same way ! __eou__ i am sure they will be pleased .
so , emily , how was your day ? __eou__ i don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__ it can't have been that bad . go on and tell me about it . __eou__ to be honest , it was horrible ! my manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__ why ? what happened ? __eou__ well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__ that's not very fair . what did you do ? __eou__ there wasn't really anything that i could do . there's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . if i had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . __eou__ does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__ he treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__ do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__ i really have no idea . all i know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__ is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? __eou__ not really . i'm hoping to live with it for a while until i get a promotion . __eou__ that's very sensible . it sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . __eou__ i try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . __eou__ that's so true . when you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way .
i don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! __eou__ why ? what are they like ? __eou__ they're incredibly selfish . they ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that i have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! __eou__ have you ever talked to them about it ? __eou__ i tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that i didin't want to ever talk to them again ! __eou__ what did they say ? __eou__ they both just talk about how great they are all the time . __eou__ they soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__ they are ! besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . they're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__ i thought you didn't talk to them much . __eou__ i don't , but they talk so loudly that i can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . __eou__ what do the other people in your apartment think about them ? __eou__ most of my other neighbours are scared of them . __eou__ maybe you should think about moving . __eou__ i can't afford to move right now . __eou__ well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . __eou__ i think you're being a bit optimistic . if you met them , you'd understand . __eou__ well , i don't know what else you could do then . do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ?
are you alright , ethan ? you don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . __eou__ to be honest , ava , i've just had a really bad day . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ first , i slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . __eou__ what did your boss say ? __eou__ he told me that if i showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . he's so mean ! __eou__ that's horrible . was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? __eou__ that was my second time . the first time , i was in a car accident . __eou__ is your boss chinese ? __eou__ no , he's from australia . before i met him , i thought australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . i had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . __eou__ what are you going to do ? __eou__ i think i'm going to look for another job . i need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . __eou__ that sounds like a sensible plan . do you want me to help you with your job search ? __eou__ that's very generous of you . thanks for the offer . __eou__ don't mention it . that's what friends are for !
hi , why do you look so depressed today , mike ? __eou__ i had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__ how come ? __eou__ it is a long story . basically , she thought i had laughed at her while i didn't . __eou__ i know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . but why not take it easy ? __eou__ yeah . it's so nice of you to comfort me .
what a nice uniform ! __eou__ thanks ; do you like it ? __eou__ not really . i was being sarcastic . does it come with the job ? __eou__ yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . they're supposed to make us look more professional . __eou__ they're not actually that bad . they could be worse . what do you think about it ? __eou__ i don't mind it , actually . i don't have to worry about what i'm going to wear every day . __eou__ so are you enjoying your new job ? __eou__ it's much better than my old one . my new boss is great . __eou__ how do you like working in sales ? __eou__ i like the fact that i get to work with people . it makes the day go by much faster . __eou__ that's good . have you met jane yet ? she's the intern in the international travel department . __eou__ yeah , i've met her . she's a genius saleswoman ! __eou__ i know ! she could sell fridges to eskimos ! __eou__ how do you know her ? __eou__ she's my cousin . __eou__ why didn't you tell me about that before ? __eou__ i don't know . i didn't think it was that interesting . __eou__ well , now that i know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime . __eou__ that's a good idea . let's discuss after work .
hey , cindy , i ’ m so sorry about yesterday . i shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone . __eou__ don ’ t worry about it . __eou__ i don ’ t know what happened to me . i just lost it . __eou__ i think you just need to get more sleep . __eou__ yes , you ’ re right . good night .
you're rather energetic today . what's going on ? __eou__ nothing really . i think i've had a few too many coffees . __eou__ free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ? __eou__ it's the only perk of this job ! how's your day going ? __eou__ not that well . i've got that monday morning feeling today . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . i can't wait for the weekend ! __eou__ your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ? __eou__ you can say that again ! he won't even let us check our personal email at work ! __eou__ that's not just your boss . no one is allowed to send personal emails from the office . __eou__ really ? i didn't know that it was against company policy . __eou__ maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all ! __eou__ no , he is . some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . he always follows the rules to a t . __eou__ try not to let it bother you too much . __eou__ thanks . i better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again ! __eou__ ok , i'll see you in a bit . __eou__ alright . see you later !
is everything alright ? __eou__ yes , everything is fine . __eou__ what took so long ? i thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! __eou__ didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? __eou__ i didn't hear anything about a delay . i thought everything was running on time . what happened ? __eou__ we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . __eou__ then what ? your plane was three hours late ! __eou__ we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . __eou__ turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , but this was the worst turbulence i'd ever experienced in my life ! everyone started getting sick . the flight attendants had to stay in their seats . the captain decided to land early . __eou__ so where did you land ? __eou__ we landed in southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . __eou__ that sounds like a nightmare ! __eou__ it wasn't too bad . at lease i'm alive . __eou__ have you had anything to eat ? __eou__ i managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . how about you ? __eou__ i had a few coffees while i was waiting . let's get out of here !
wow , it that your sports car ? __eou__ yes , do you like it ? __eou__ i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green jaguar . is it in good condition ? __eou__ it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ when's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ it must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ they do . once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ what else is wrong with it ? __eou__ the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ anything else ? __eou__ the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ well , let me know when you can get it fixed . i ’ d love to go for a ride in it !
so , how should we go to the theatre ? __eou__ let's take the bus . __eou__ i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . __eou__ it's not that bad . you probably just had a bad experience once . __eou__ it wasn't just once . every single time i take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . __eou__ we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . __eou__ train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . __eou__ if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . should we take the bus ? __eou__ we're already late , so i think we had better take a taxi . __eou__ i don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . let's just take the bus . __eou__ fine . have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . __eou__ it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . __eou__ don't worry . nothing bad will happen . i'll even buy your ticket for you . __eou__ thanks , that was nice of you . __eou__ see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
did you get my email ? __eou__ i certainly did . do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ how did the business trip go ? __eou__ well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . __eou__ i understand . the last time i went on a business trip with the boss , i didn't even have enough to eat ! __eou__ i also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . i spent half of the weekend on a train ! surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! __eou__ our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . __eou__ i see . well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . it was really tiring for me . __eou__ i can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . __eou__ thank you . i can't imagine getting much done today . i'm just too exhausted ! __eou__ no problem . did you bring any gifts back for your department ? __eou__ no , should i have ?
are you ready to go the concert ? __eou__ yes . should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? __eou__ actually , why don't we go there by bike ? we could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . __eou__ that's true . cycling is good for our environment , too . let me just get my helmet then . __eou__ is your helmet comfortable ? __eou__ not really , but i liked the design , so i got it . __eou__ maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . __eou__ i'll think about it . __eou__ is that your new bicycle ? __eou__ yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . do you like it ? __eou__ it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . these are really expensive ! __eou__ nothing but the best from my dad . i like everything about it except for the brakes . they are a bit sticky . __eou__ i can fix those for you . is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ well , my saddle is too low for me . do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ that's easy . it's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . __eou__ is that why my knees have felt sore after every time i've ridden my bike ? __eou__ it's possible . give me a minute and i can fix these for you and then we can go .
it smells like an ashtray in here ! __eou__ hi honey ! what ’ s wrong ? why do you have that look on your face ? __eou__ what ’ s wrong ? i thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . __eou__ no ! i said i was going to cut down which is very different . you can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! __eou__ look , there are other ways to quit . you can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . we spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . it ’ s not like you can just light up like before . __eou__ i know , i know . i am trying but , i don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . i can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! please understand ? __eou__ fine ! i want a divorce !
ok ... i ’ ll talk to you later . bye __eou__ carrie , are you ok ? you seem a bit down . __eou__ i just got off the phone with my boyfriend . he is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . it ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . __eou__ maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . he does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . __eou__ yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . i try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . __eou__ men are like that you know.they can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . __eou__ i guess you are right . what do you think i should do ? he wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... __eou__ talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , i say get rid of him and get a new one ! __eou__ you are something else you know that ?
hi , i made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . the name is jimmy fox . __eou__ i ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . __eou__ i don ’ t understand , i made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? __eou__ yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . __eou__ but the reservation keeps the car here . that ’ s why you have the reservation . __eou__ i know why we have reservations . __eou__ i don ’ t think you do.if you did , i ’ d have a car.see , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . anybody can just take them . __eou__ but we do have a compact or an suv if you ’ d like . __eou__ fine . i ’ ll take the compact . __eou__ alright . we have a blue ford focus for you , mr . fox . would you like insurance ? __eou__ yeah , you better give me the insurance , because i am gonna beat the hell out of this car .
oh , my god ! i've been cheated ! __eou__ what ? what did you buy ? __eou__ it's a brick ! i can't believe how stupid i was . damn it ! __eou__ what is it ? why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ there was a guy on the sidewalk.he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes.he said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ and ? __eou__ so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ and it's a brick ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ i can't believe how stupid you are . why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.if it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new . __eou__ but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen . __eou__ aha ! now i understand.you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.so , what i think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it.we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ that's no problem.he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . that's easy.and probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.maybe his friend works in an electronics store . they sell video cameras there . probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.twenty dollars a brick . that's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ you're right , sarah . i was a fool . i can't believe it . how could i fall for such a trick ?
... now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , ed ! give us some good news . how are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? __eou__ uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? __eou__ what ? ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! __eou__ well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . we are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . the market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . if we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . it ’ s a real mess . __eou__ for crying out loud ... how fast are we losing money ? __eou__ um ... how can i put this ? let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__ what ! geez ! how could this have happened ? so what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__ oh , that ’ s the really bad news . our supplier suffered qc problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . we ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . and the worst part ? we ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__ are you joking ? get the supplier on the line now ! they have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__ we tried that , sir . the factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__ we ’ re doomed ! __eou__ there is some really good news though ! __eou__ really ? what ! __eou__ i got offered a new job !
valerie ! hi ! wow how have you been ? it ’ s been such a long time ! __eou__ darlene ! indeed , it ’ s been a while ! how have you been ? wow , you look amazing ! i love what you ’ ve done with your hair ! __eou__ really ? thanks ! i went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! look at you ! you haven ’ t aged a day since the last time i saw you ! what is your secret ! __eou__ ha ha , come on ! well , i ’ ve been watching what i eat , and working out three times a week . by the way , i heard your son recently graduated ! __eou__ yes , my little paul is finally a doctor . they grow up so fast you know . __eou__ he is such a handsome guy . he gets his looks from his mother of course ! __eou__ thank you ! what about your daughter , pamela ? i heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . __eou__ oh yes . she had a beautiful wedding in cozumel mexico and we all attended . __eou__ such a lovely girl . i hope my paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! __eou__ but of course ! well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but i have to get going . __eou__ same here ! we will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! __eou__ that would be great ! give me a call ! __eou__ see you soon ! bye ! egg ... i can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .
hey , tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? __eou__ oh , don't mention it . it was terrible . __eou__ what ' the matter ? __eou__ the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone . __eou__ i see . you simply can't blame the server for this . __eou__ yes , i know . fast food is so popular in this district . __eou__ that's true . __eou__ anyway , how was your such , catherine ? __eou__ it was good . i brough lunch from home today . __eou__ you did ? i thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america . __eou__ well , i personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy . __eou__ i guess you're right . more often than not , people go there only for convenience . the foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . __eou__ yes . i am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ? __eou__ you bet . almost all top brands such as mcdonald's and kfc are from america . __eou__ well , actually two-thirds of americans may avoid these places . __eou__ seriously ? __eou__ yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
the sun is up ! time for all the campers to rise . time to get paddling . __eou__ oh , no ! no more paddling ! my arms are sore ! __eou__ do not worry . today will be easier . __eou__ beth , what date is today ? __eou__ today is saturday . __eou__ what is the date today ? __eou__ today is july 4th . __eou__ oh , i almost forgot . today is my mom's birthday . __eou__ call her on my cell phone . wish her “ happy birthday ! ” tell her you are out exploring the great american wilderness . tell her i said she is lucky to be born on independence day . __eou__ thanks ! i will do that ! when is your birthday ? __eou__ it is december 25th . __eou__ wow ! what a lucky girl ! your birthday is on christmas day . __eou__ yes , i am lucky . i was born on christ ’ s birthday . maybe that is why i usually go to church on sundays . when is your birthday ? __eou__ april 2nd . i missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . i guess i am lucky , too ! __eou__ that is true ! here , have some granola for breakfast . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ after eating , we will take down our tent . then we will pack everything into the canoe , we can shove off by 6 __eou__ i guess so . __eou__ how about going for swim around 10 __eou__ that should work out great . you are miracle worker ! you have got me awake and motivated . __eou__ happy independence day !
it's getting cold . __eou__ yes . i bought a scarf yesterday . it's really nice and warm . have a look . __eou__ oh , it's made of wool . i like the striped pattern . __eou__ yes , i adore simple fashions . how does it look on me ? __eou__ it looks great , but you need something to go with it . it's too plain on its own . __eou__ how about this blue sweater ? __eou__ that's a good idea . when did you buy it ? is it a name brand ? __eou__ yes , but i bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . ok , what do you think ? __eou__ that looks lovely . just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . __eou__ i've got a pair of pearl earrings . here it is . __eou__ perfect ! __eou__ you have good fashion sense , karen . __eou__ thanks . we should be ourselves . there are so many fashion victims out there . __eou__ yes , but with our sense we'll always look good .
hi , lander . what's wrong ? __eou__ i can hardly make ends meet these days . __eou__ same here . i have't brought any new clothes for three months . __eou__ my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . __eou__ true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . __eou__ definitely . i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . __eou__ the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . __eou__ is that inflation ? __eou__ inflation is more than just the rising prices , i guess . but the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . __eou__ has the government taken some measures to curb it ? __eou__ yes . the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . __eou__ but i'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . __eou__ you said it . i think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . __eou__ how ? __eou__ for a start , we can take the public transport to work . you know , running a car is a big expense . __eou__ sounds a good idea .
your garden is looking beautiful this summer . the flowers are really colorful . __eou__ thank you . i have roses , tulips , and daffodils . do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? __eou__ yes , i do . those are violets , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ yes , they are . this afternoon , i ’ m going to prune the hedge . __eou__ the lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . would you like me to cut them off for you ? __eou__ thank you ! that would be very kind of you . i have a saw in the garden shed . __eou__ when the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . __eou__ tomorrow , i ’ ll cut the grass . then the garden will lock perfect . __eou__ just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .
veronica ! veronica ! veronica ! are you ok ? __eou__ steven ! what ’ s going on ! who were those guys ? i didn ’ t know you have a gun ! what ’ s going on ! __eou__ i will come clean as soon as we get to safety , ok ? for now , you have to trust me , please ! i would never do anything to hurt you . __eou__ steven , i ... __eou__ i haven ’ t been completely honest with you veronica , i ’ m sorry . i ’ m not a fireman . i ’ m not even from the united states . i ’ m a spy for the indian government . __eou__ what ? why didn ’ t you tell me before ? what are you doing here ? __eou__ when i was a young boy , i used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of hyderabad . it was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . one day , he was approached by members of the cia , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . i never saw him again . i vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the indian intelligence bureau . __eou__ what does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? most importantly , why did you lie to me ! __eou__ i ’ m sorry , i wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . i wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when i tell you that what i feel for you is real . __eou__ i can ’ t believe this ! why are all these things happening to me ! i can ’ t take it anymore ! let me out of the car ! __eou__ veronica , wait !
stephanie ! did you just get to school ? but you were up and about when i left the dorm this morning ! that was about an hour and a half ago . this happens all the time ! why do you always take so long __eou__ it ’ s a skill . what can i say ? i don ’ t know why , i just have a long routine . __eou__ please explain because it makes no sense to me . how can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? you get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . half an hour , tops . __eou__ jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . i don ’ t . i have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . every day , i wake up and head straight for the shower . every second day , i wash my hair . if it ’ s a hair-washing day , i frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . then i usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . because my hair is so long , i seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . afterwards , i often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while i wait for it to brew . i take a long time to get dressed in the morning . every now and then i remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually i do it in the morning . in all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then i have to style my hair . from time to time i ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times i bloody it straight . and then , because of the texture of my hair , i regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . that ’ s another twenty minutes or so . after that , i have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ true , i hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ not funny .
i'm not satisfied with it . __eou__ why not ? what's wrong with it ? __eou__ sometimes it goes fast . and sometimes it goes slow . and the alarm doesn'twork , either . __eou__ would you like another one ? __eou__ no . can i have my money back ? __eou__ hmm ... have you got a receipt ? __eou__ a receipt ? __eou__ yes . i must see your receipt . you can't have your money back without receipt . __eou__ oh , i'm not certain , but i think i've lost it .
you mustn't touch the wet paint , bill . __eou__ i'm sorry . i won't do it again . __eou__ try to be more careful in future . __eou__ i shall . i wasn't as careless as john sampson . he walked across that wet cement over there . __eou__ the workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice . __eou__ the headmaster asked them not to do so . __eou__ then why isn't there a notice ? __eou__ they went to their stores to get one . here they come with it now ! __eou__ but look at them ! they've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice !
mom , why do chinese people like to touch my head ? sometimes they even touch my cheeks . __eou__ that is a part of chinese culture , if they think you are a lovely child , they touch your head and say , how cute you are . __eou__ but i donor like it , not a bit , i am not a pet , i am a girl . __eou__ well , you get used to it , different countries have different manners . __eou__ but i do not like anyone touch my head . __eou__ they are just been in friendly , when you are in roman , do as the romans do , that means you need to adapt to your enviroment . __eou__ what if everybody in the wheres goes crazy ? __eou__ then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy . __eou__ does this mean that if i might want those new european bitches , i am supposed to wonder run reget ? __eou__ do you think it is a ~ got give your brain , use it if you really cannot accept it people touch your head , keep distance from them , why not just wear your big flyby hat and ~ is anyone get close to you . __eou__ that is my work , i will try it .
so , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . well done ! __eou__ thanks . now , i have to find a job . __eou__ what are you thinking of doing ? __eou__ i ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . it would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . __eou__ there must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . you could do some research for a university . there ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . someone wit __eou__ many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . few people know where next discoveries will be made . __eou__ well , i hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! i wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment .
next please ! hello sir , may i see your passport please ? __eou__ yes , here you go . __eou__ will you be checking any bags today . __eou__ yes , i ’ d like to check three pieces . __eou__ i ’ m sorry , sir . airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . i will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . __eou__ what ? why ! i am taking an intercontinental flight ! i ’ m flying sixteen thousand cms ! how am i supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? that ’ s absurd ! __eou__ i am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing i can do . you cannot board the flight with that large bag either.carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . that bag is clearly too big . __eou__ now i see . you charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! so tell me , miss , how much will i have to pay for all of this . __eou__ let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five us dollars . __eou__ that ’ s more than my round-trip ticket !

oh , my god ! i've been cheated ! __eou__ what ? what did you buy ? __eou__ it's a brick ! i can't believe how stupid i was . damn it ! __eou__ what is it ? why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ there was a guy on the sidewalk.he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes.he said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ and ? __eou__ so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ and it's a brick ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ i can't believe how stupid you are . why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.if it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new . __eou__ but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen . __eou__ aha ! now i understand.you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.so , what i think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it.we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ that's no problem.he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . that's easy.and probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.maybe his friend works in an electronics store . they sell video cameras there . probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.twenty dollars a brick . that's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ you're right , sarah . i was a fool . i can't believe it . how could i fall for such a trick ?
doris , i'm glad you're home . i'm terrified . i don't know what to do ! __eou__ what is it ? what happened ? __eou__ i think someone is stalking me . __eou__ no , it can't be . really ? who ? __eou__ i don't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring.he just kept staring at me . he didn't stop . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ i didn't do anything . finally , he left.but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but then he came in too . __eou__ did he leave when you left ? __eou__ yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ he followed me all the way home ! __eou__ that's about five blocks . and around corners too.so he was definitely following you . __eou__ yes , he was . i'm not imagining it.finally , just when i got home , i turned around and looked at him.he was just standing there . he didn't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious.what should i do ? i'm so scared . can i call the police ? __eou__ actually , i don't think you can call the police . not yet at least.he hasn't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it.but if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ why can't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me ! __eou__ of course you can call the police if you want . that's not what i mean . i'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ i suppose . what can they do ? i don't even know who he is . __eou__ listen , carol . don't let this bother you too much.probably it's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out.if you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then i think we should go to the police.but for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ alright . and i won't go to that cafe for awhile .
i ’ ve had it ! i ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ so what are you gonna do ? just quit ? __eou__ that ’ s exactly what i am going to do ! i ’ ve decided to create my own company ! i ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ you couldn ’ t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ wait , there ’ s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? then comes the hard part , a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has ! all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ geez . is that all ? __eou__ almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . after all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ umm . i think i ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !

the mosquitos are biting me ! __eou__ me , too , i can ’ t stop scratching . they are everywhere ! sneaky little jerks . __eou__ do you have any bug spray ? __eou__ no , i forgot to buy some . __eou__ then we ’ ll have to put up with it . __eou__ we can cover ourselves with beer ! that way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . __eou__ that ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ ve had ! let ’ s do it ! __eou__ run ! they are thirsty for more !
what are you doing ? __eou__ look at me . i look so old ! i look as if i were thirty . __eou__ come on ! stop being so vain . you look great ! you are beautiful ! __eou__ yes , i am , but i think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery i ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . see ? __eou__ i don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! you are stop beings ridiculous . besides , i think that people who get boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.it doesn ’ t look natural . __eou__ whatever , i think i ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . __eou__ i think you need to get brain surgery . i honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.you look amazing . __eou__ i thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! i just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . __eou__ you don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . you are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! plus , plastic surgery hurts ! __eou__ really ? __eou__ yeah ! when i got my nose job i was black and blue for a week !
honey come on ! we are going to be late ! honestly , you take longer getting ready than i do ! __eou__ i was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! can you come here for a sec ? i need your help . __eou__ what is it ? why are all these clothes on the bed ? __eou__ i don ’ t know what to wear ! ok , give me your opinion . do you like the way this looks ? the striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . i like the cut and hemline of these shorts so i think i ’ ll wear these as well . __eou__ are you joking ? what am i going to do with you ? we are going to a dinner party not the beach ! wear the shirt with the silk tie i bought you and these corduroy pants . it ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . __eou__ thanks honey ! you have such great fashion sense.now , what am i going to do with my hair ?
wow , that terrible movie is finally over . next time i ’ m picking the film , because i don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ not everything , just this film . even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that i ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ i ’ m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ i ’ m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ you see , that ’ s what i ’ m talking about , i can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore __eou__ next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ love stories ? more like one-night-stands . __eou__ don ’ t criticize mario or else i ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . __eou__ my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ you ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , i ’ m leaving .
honey , i ’ ll be right back ! __eou__ where are you going ? __eou__ i told you already ! i ’ m going to get my nails done . __eou__ again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? __eou__ well , first of all , i like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . you should come with me ! __eou__ why ? i don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! __eou__ they don ’ t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! __eou__ yeah , sounds like something i should definitely do .
hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? __eou__ haven't been sleeping well recently . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ every night my roommates watch the korean soap operas till mid-night . i am not a big fan of korean shows and i don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . __eou__ well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down . __eou__ yeah , i know , but i find these sorts of things hard to say . they won't like it if i tell them to turn off the tv . now i just hope the show will end soon . __eou__ i understand . i used to live in a dorm with four people . i was great in some aspects . we always went out and and had fun together . but on the other hand , when i wanted some quiet time , and people kept __eou__ yeah , i crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time .
hey , ann , i am really sorry about last night . i shouldn't have said those things to you . __eou__ i am sorry too . i know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . i should have told bob i was busy this weekend . __eou__ don't be silly . you guys should spend as much time together as you can . besides we can go to the beach anytime . __eou__ thanks for understanding . __eou__ well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? __eou__ hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? besides , you and bob haven't seen each other for a while . i don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . __eou__ nah , i wouldn't worry about that . but i don't want to be the third wheel . you two should have some quiet time to yourselves . __eou__ i know bob won't mind . you can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . __eou__ maybe ... i'll think about it .
hi mary , how's it going ? __eou__ well , last night i had a big argument with ann . __eou__ terrible . it must be something serious . you two are such close friends . __eou__ now that i look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . i shouldn't have lost my temper . __eou__ really ? what happened ? __eou__ it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee __eou__ that's pretty harsh . __eou__ i know , but i was so upset . i mean , come on ! does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? __eou__ you know she probably feels just as bad . __eou__ well , i think i was being a little selfish myself . i know they don't get to see each other very often . __eou__ well , in that case i guess maybe you can be more understanding . you shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . after all you can go to the beach anytime you want . __eou__ yeah , i'll call her later to patch things up .
the dinner was really good . it knocked my socks off . __eou__ that's very kind of you to say so . let's try some after-dinner wines . __eou__ great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal . __eou__ do you prefer brandy or ports . __eou__ port , please . __eou__ excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor . __eou__ the port is exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ? __eou__ yes . you always have a good nose for wines . __eou__ next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine . __eou__ oh , what's that ? __eou__ it's made from naturally frozen grapes . __eou__ why not ? it sounds great . __eou__ oh , here's to your health . __eou__ thanks . cheers . __eou__ cheers .
we are going out for dinner tonight . are you coming , betty ? __eou__ i'm not sure . i have to check my schedule . where are you going ? __eou__ oh , jake made a reservation at friday's . __eou__ jack ? __eou__ yes , the one with the r $ d team . is that a problem ? __eou__ i will never go out with him anymore . __eou__ why did you say so ? __eou__ last time when we had dinner at the smith's , it was a horrible experience . he had no manners at all ! __eou__ oh , really ? __eou__ he made a lot of noises while eating . he talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . __eou__ are you kidding me ? how could he behave like that ? __eou__ it is true . everyone kept looking at him . it was so embarrassing as i was sitting right next to him . __eou__ what a shame ! didn't he realized that ? __eou__ i have no idea . he seemed to enjoy the dinner very much . __eou__ maybe he should really something about eating etiquette . __eou__ oh , he really should .
i can ’ t believe it ! __eou__ what ’ s wrong ? that was a great goal . __eou__ yes , but i bet $ 200 dollars on the cougars ! __eou__ looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . __eou__ i can ’ t believe it ! i thought the cougars were going to win for sure . __eou__ what were the odds ? __eou__ 20 to 1 , in favour of the cougars ! __eou__ too bad .
doris , i'm glad you're home . i'm terrified . i don't know what to do ! __eou__ what is it ? what happened ? __eou__ i think someone is stalking me . __eou__ no , it can't be . really ? who ? __eou__ i don't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring.he just kept staring at me . he didn't stop . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ i didn't do anything . finally , he left.but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but then he came in too . __eou__ did he leave when you left ? __eou__ yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me . __eou__ what did you do ?
he followed me all the way home ! __eou__ that's about five blocks . and around corners too.so he was definitely following you . __eou__ yes , he was . i'm not imagining it.finally , just when i got home , i turned around and looked at him.he was just standing there . he didn't smile . he just stood there . it was so obvious.what should i do ? i'm so scared . can i call the police ? __eou__ actually , i don't think you can call the police . not yet at least.he hasn't done anything . and probably the police will just ignore it.but if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ why can't i call the police now ? he was definitely following me ! __eou__ of course you can call the police if you want . that's not what i mean . i'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ i suppose . what can they do ? i don't even know who he is . __eou__ listen , carol . don't let this bother you too much.probably it's nothing . just keep your eyes open when you go out.if you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then i think we should go to the police.but for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ alright . and i won't go to that cafe for awhile .
hi , bob , everything okay ? __eou__ more or less . there's just one thing bothering me . __eou__ oh ? what's that ? __eou__ well , you know i have some students studying for their master's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy . __eou__ what gift ? __eou__ it's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was , i was really uncomfortable . i mean it's too expensive a gift __eou__ you refused the gift ? that's terrible . __eou__ i know , but i really can't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way . __eou__ perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . __eou__ that's what i am worried about . i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored . but i really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor .
are you cold ? __eou__ yes , a little . __eou__ i wonder if we can change the temperature . __eou__ i tried before . there are no buttons on the air conditioning . __eou__ there must be buttons . how do they turn it on and off ? __eou__ i think it is centrally controlled . they control it at the main desk . __eou__ well , they have it too cold in here . i want to be warmer . i won't be able to sleep . __eou__ i'm going downstairs for more drinking water . i will ask them . __eou__ what did they say about the air conditioning ? __eou__ they said it is centrally controlled.all the rooms are the same . they can't change it . __eou__ that's stupid . how can i sleep in this ? __eou__ you can wear more clothes .
i tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak english well enough.so i decided to go to the magazine shop . the one around the corner.and i bought an american newspaper . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ it seems that yesterday the mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the world bank.the government declared a default on the loans . __eou__ that's serious . __eou__ i know . the economy here is having serious problems.but because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . __eou__ so now mexican pesos are worth about half as much . __eou__ yes , it's an amazing drop . __eou__ wow . i feel sorry for the mexicans . but it's good for us . __eou__ yes , it's very good . we suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! isn't that strange ? __eou__ yes , and you know what ? __eou__ what ? __eou__ i don't really like this hotel that much.so tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? __eou__ why not ? we should do it . because now we can afford it .
oh , my god ! i've been cheated ! __eou__ what ? what did you buy ? __eou__ it's a brick ! i can't believe how stupid i was . damn it ! __eou__ what is it ? why did you buy a brick ? __eou__ there was a guy on the sidewalk.he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes.he said he had to get rid of them quick . __eou__ and ? __eou__ so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . __eou__ and it's a brick ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ i can't believe how stupid you are . why didn't you open the box ? __eou__ i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.if it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . __eou__ so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . __eou__ yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new . __eou__ but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? __eou__ he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen . __eou__ aha ! now i understand.you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.so , what i think is , you deserve to get cheated ! __eou__ c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it.we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ that's no problem.he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . that's easy.and probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.maybe his friend works in an electronics store . they sell video cameras there.probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.twenty dollars a brick . that's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . __eou__ you're right , sarah . i was a fool . i can't believe it . how could i fall for such a trick ?
so , you ’ re applying for a b2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the united states ? __eou__ i ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . he lives in minneapolis . __eou__ and how long do you you plan to remain in the united states ? __eou__ i ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . see , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of march . __eou__ and , who is sponsoring your trip ? __eou__ my brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . i will stay with him and his family in their home . __eou__ alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country . __eou__ well , i own a house . actually , i ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . i have a car at home , and oh , my job ! i ’ m employed by tornal as an engineer . actually , i only have three weeks ’ vacation , so i have to go back to work at the end of march . __eou__ and what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ? __eou__ well , i do have assets in my country . like i said , i own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . __eou__ i ’ m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a b2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! you win ! congratulations !

what's your favorite magazine ? __eou__ off hand , i'd say the reader's digests is my favorite . __eou__ what kind of magazine is it ? __eou__ it's instructive and inspiring . __eou__ really ? it is a weekly , isn't it ? __eou__ no , it's a semimonthly . __eou__ does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? __eou__ yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . __eou__ oh , i think i should try to read one .

hey , there's leo . i wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman . __eou__ it's as plain as the nose on your face . they're dating each other . __eou__ you're pulling my leg ! she must be thirty years younger than leo . talk about robbing the cradle ! __eou__ well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan . __eou__ it must have been love at first sight because i know he didn't have a girlfriend last week . __eou__ i think you are absolutely right . actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . they got married a month later .
well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? __eou__ it was fun , i tell you . __eou__ tell me about it , will you ? __eou__ well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . it was a magnificent sight ! __eou__ did you stop at the fall for some pictures ? __eou__ sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . __eou__ you were lucky then . __eou__ yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . we had our picnic there , too . __eou__ what did you do after that ? __eou__ we went for a swim in the sea . that was the biggest part of the day . just look at my nice tan ! __eou__ so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . __eou__ yes , you are right . and i was so tired out that i fell asleep on the way back . my muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
you must be pretty excited about your trip to europe . when is it that you are leaving ? __eou__ in just three weeks , and i am excited . but there are still a few things i need to do before i go . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while i'm gone . __eou__ you are not going to give it up , are you ? __eou__ no way . i'll never find another apartment around here . but i don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . __eou__ i don't blame you . perhaps you could sublet it . __eou__ yes , but whom to ? __eou__ mmm ... let me think . oh , i know just a person . an old colleague of mine , jim thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from june to august . __eou__ that's exactly when i'll be away . it sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . __eou__ tell you what , i'll be calling jim late this week anyway , so i'll mention it to him then . __eou__ well , thanks , bill . let me know what happens . that extra money will really come in handy .
hello , bob , this is frank . __eou__ i know , we've met . __eou__ i didn't know you knew frank . __eou__ yes , we met last year at a conference .
i can't believe it , i had faith in bob and he let me down . __eou__ i know what you mean . __eou__ really ? __eou__ yes , he did the same to me .
ben , what are you doing ? __eou__ well , i would say that i ’ m just drifting - - here , in the pool . __eou__ why ? __eou__ well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here . __eou__ have you thought about graduate school ? __eou__ no . __eou__ would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? what was the point of all that hard work ? __eou__ you got me . __eou__ now listen , ben . look , i think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass .
what food do you fancy ? __eou__ i feel like something good to eat . __eou__ how about going to joe's restaurant . __eou__ hey , that sounds a good idea .
hi , how is it going ? __eou__ pretty good , sam . only the awful weather , you know . __eou__ that ’ s right . i ’ ve never really liked it since i got here . __eou__ me either , but i ’ m dealing with it anyway .

happy anniversary , honey . __eou__ i thought you had forgotten . __eou__ after the trouble i got into last year , no way . __eou__ thank you honey , it means a lot to me .
what did you say ? __eou__ i said it's a lovely day . why don't we go for a walk ? __eou__ well , i feel a little tired . __eou__ come on ! a little labor , much health . __eou__ then can you wait a few minutes ? i want to finish writing this letter . __eou__ don't take too long . it would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . __eou__ i won't be long . no more than ten minutes . why don't you go ahead and i'll meet you in the park ? __eou__ i believe i will . look for me near the lake .
did you find what you were looking for ? __eou__ i tried when you had gone , but i had no luck . __eou__ okay , let's both look for it now . __eou__ okay .
i'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . __eou__ i trust you ’ re keeping well ? __eou__ i'm doing great , thank you . __eou__ so we can get down to business .
hey , bob . are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? __eou__ yes , i'm sure i've been here before . __eou__ maybe we're walking in circles . __eou__ yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago .
it was great meeting you . __eou__ me too . __eou__ maybe we can meet again sometime ? __eou__ of course , but i'll have to go now .
mary , i think we should stop seeing each other . __eou__ but , bob , we were so good together . __eou__ i'm sorry but it's for the best . __eou__ i don't understand . we were getting along so well .

how about going to the cinema tonight ? __eou__ that's great . what's on tonight ? __eou__ i am not sure about the name of the film , but i know it's a romantic one . __eou__ romantic ? i am afraid i like thrillers better . __eou__ don't you think it's too bloody ? __eou__ on the contrary , very exciting .
nice day today , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , beautiful weather we're having . __eou__ we can't complain about the weather recently . __eou__ yes , the sun shines day after day . it's neither too hot nor too cold . __eou__ i wonder how long this weather can last . __eou__ i hope it will last fine sorrow . i'm going to have a picnic with my family .
i'm going to japan this year on vacation . __eou__ have you ever been to america ? __eou__ no , but i'd really like to . __eou__ you'd like it .

hello bill , what's new ? __eou__ bob and mary are back together . __eou__ i'm glad to hear it . __eou__ me too , they're such a nice couple .
where are you going to spend your holidays this year , tom ? __eou__ we may go abroad , my wife wants to go to egypt , and i'd like to go there too . we haven't made up our mind yet . __eou__ will you travel by sea or by air ? __eou__ we may travel by sea . it's cheaper . __eou__ i'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves .
how do you like your work ? __eou__ the work is rather hard , but it's interesting . __eou__ what do you do ? __eou__ i work in a publishing house . how about you ? __eou__ mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . __eou__ what do you do then ? __eou__ i'm a clerk in a shop .
good morning . __eou__ good morning . __eou__ what does the paper say ? __eou__ nothing much — the same old stuff . a lot of bad news as usual . __eou__ well , what ’ s the weather report ? __eou__ sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow . __eou__ did they find those bank robbers ? __eou__ not yet . they were holding two men in ohio , but they let them go . they weren ’ t the criminals after all . __eou__ what about the sports page ? what were the scores of last night ’ s games ? __eou__ here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself .
thanks for your help . __eou__ no problem , anytime . __eou__ let me know if i can do anything for you . __eou__ okay , thank you .
i was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . __eou__ i agree , i think that that would be perfect ! __eou__ i was thinking it could take place sometime in january . __eou__ that might be a little too cold for some people . __eou__ yes , you are right . __eou__ what about april ? april has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . __eou__ yes , that would work out better . __eou__ you know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . __eou__ good idea ! we'll have to get right on it . __eou__ fine ! well , i'll get right on it now !
could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? __eou__ that would be a possibility . where is this fundraiser taking place ? __eou__ it is in the hotel ballroom down the street . __eou__ do you need it for the whole weekend ? __eou__ we will need it for both days . __eou__ we will need to know who will be driving the van . __eou__ the van will be driven by mary and me . __eou__ it needs to be back on sunday night . can you arrange for that ? __eou__ oh yeah , no problem . would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . __eou__ just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by sunday evening .
the mountains would be a great place for the company retreat . __eou__ that's a wonderful choice . __eou__ i have chosen january as the month for this retreat . __eou__ january is a little too close to the christmas holidays . __eou__ yes , maybe another choice might be better . __eou__ i think that april would work . spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains . __eou__ thank you for thinking of that . __eou__ maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . __eou__ that is a good idea . __eou__ i'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers .
i am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday . __eou__ are you certain that that is what you want to do ? __eou__ it may not be the best choice for me , but i am considering it . __eou__ why do you think that this would be a good move ? __eou__ i believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me . __eou__ yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change . __eou__ also , the matter of pay is also a consideration . __eou__ i think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . the benefits are much better . __eou__ yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice . __eou__ i think you should definitely apply for the position .
i think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . __eou__ what a great idea ! __eou__ january would be a good month for a mountain retreat . __eou__ i like the mountain idea , but i am not so sure about the month of january . __eou__ you know , now that i think about it , you might be right . __eou__ april might be nice . it is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . __eou__ that is a good suggestion . __eou__ we could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . __eou__ yeah , that would let us know what would work best . __eou__ i'll put the survey online this afternoon .
i was wondering if i could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend . __eou__ sure , i think that would be possible . where is the fundraiser ? __eou__ it is in the park downtown . __eou__ would you need it for both saturday and sunday ? __eou__ we will need it for saturday only . __eou__ i think that would be ok . who will be driving it ? __eou__ mary and i will be driving the van . __eou__ could you drop it off on sunday night ? __eou__ yes , we can do that . can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ? __eou__ yes , that would be fine . just make sure that everything is returned by sunday night .
our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible . __eou__ i would need to check on that . where is the fundraiser ? __eou__ it will be at the beach by the pier . __eou__ what day will you need it for ? __eou__ we will only be needing it for sunday . __eou__ maybe that could work . i need to know who will be driving it . __eou__ the only two drivers will be mary and i . __eou__ if i give you the keys to the garage , could you bring it back on sunday evening ? __eou__ sure . we also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom . would that be ok ? __eou__ ok , but make sure that everything is back by sunday night at the latest .
you're spending a very long time on my hair . __eou__ i'm almost done . __eou__ i needed you to be done and finished an hour ago . __eou__ i'm all done now . __eou__ are you sure you're finished ? __eou__ i don't understand . __eou__ you did a horrible job on my hair . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ i don't like anything about it . __eou__ i apologize . __eou__ that's fine , but i'm not paying for it . __eou__ excuse me ? let's try to work this out , okay ?
what's taking you so long ? __eou__ don't worry . i'm almost finished . __eou__ i need you to hurry up . __eou__ all right . i'm finished . __eou__ i think there's more you need to do . __eou__ what do you mean by that ? __eou__ my hair looks awful . __eou__ what don't you like about it ? __eou__ i just don't like my hair . __eou__ i'm sorry that you don't like it . __eou__ i won't be paying you for this . __eou__ i'm sure we can work something out .
we're thinking about going to america . __eou__ have you thought about the cost ? __eou__ there is that . __eou__ i believe it'll be very expensive .
broadway mall is having a big sale this weekend . you wanna go ? __eou__ don't feel like it . i'm broke . __eou__ well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? __eou__ just look around ? ah , that's boring . __eou__ i'll go myself then .
this is great , isn't it ? __eou__ it's the most fun i've had in years . __eou__ we should do this more often . __eou__ yes , we should .
hello , mr . brown , long time no see . where have you been ? __eou__ oh , i went on a holiday in the city of chende . __eou__ great . what do you think of it ? __eou__ the city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . __eou__ did you go to the summer mountain resort ? __eou__ certainly ! the most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of forbidden city and 16 times the size of summer palace . the art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . __eou__ it sounds great , and is it really cool there ? __eou__ yes , i think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the resort . __eou__ what is the special local product ? __eou__ the main product of chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . the mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . __eou__ i hope to go there someday .
what was that all about ? __eou__ we had a difference of opinion . __eou__ is she going to be okay ? __eou__ she'll be fine .
what day is it ? __eou__ it's monday , october 27 . speaking of dates , when are you leaving ? __eou__ i'm leaving on november 10th . __eou__ isn't it a sunday ? __eou__ no , it's a monday . __eou__ so you are leaving two weeks from now ? __eou__ right .
what do you think of when you're praying ? __eou__ i try to picture the lord's face in my mind . __eou__ does that help you faith ? __eou__ yes .
excuse me . do you have the time ? __eou__ my watch is a few minutes fast . it's about six forty , i think . __eou__ is it ? oh , no . the concert will begin in twenty minutes . are we too late to get there ? __eou__ if we start now , we can make it by taxi .
i need help preparing for my presentation on friday . __eou__ i could help you with that . __eou__ are you sure you have the time ? __eou__ i promise you that i have the time to do this . if i didn't , i wouldn't offer to help . __eou__ what would be the best time for you to help me ? __eou__ tomorrow night would work for me . __eou__ should we just meet here ? __eou__ ok , and i'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation . __eou__ i'll see you then . __eou__ see you tomorrow night .
whoa , look at all those ice cream choices ! __eou__ yes , that is a lot of choices . what is your favorite ? __eou__ i love anything with chocolate the best . __eou__ i like chocolate myself . __eou__ is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ? __eou__ i really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it . __eou__ i haven't ever cared for that myself . __eou__ have you ever had garlic ice cream ? __eou__ that sounds absolutely disgusting ! __eou__ it was . let's stick with the regular choices today , though .
hi , why do you look so depressed today , mike ? __eou__ i had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . __eou__ how come ? __eou__ it is a long story . basically , she thought i had laughed at her while i didn't . __eou__ i know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . but why not take it easy ? __eou__ yeah . it's so nice of you to comfort me .
could you help me prepare for my presentation on friday ? __eou__ i would love to help you prepare for your presentation . __eou__ i hate to ask you to do something like that . __eou__ this will not interfere with my work . i promise you that . __eou__ when could we get together ? __eou__ i could easily give you some time tomorrow night . __eou__ would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ? __eou__ yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ? __eou__ i'll come prepared . __eou__ goodbye until then . i promise you that you'll do well after we meet .
there are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! __eou__ yes , there must be about a hundred . do you have a favorite ? __eou__ i love fruit flavored ices the best . __eou__ i know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever . __eou__ what is your least favorite ice cream ? __eou__ i don't like peppermint ice cream . __eou__ yeah , i know what you mean . __eou__ one time , i tried garlic ice cream . __eou__ that could be interesting . __eou__ that doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . let's order !
i was thinking about applying for the new position . __eou__ do you think that is a good idea ? __eou__ it seems like a good idea but i am not really sure . __eou__ what are your main concerns ? __eou__ well , it would give me a chance to grow , but i am wondering if i would like the job . __eou__ i know what you mean , i've thought about that myself . __eou__ i am also thinking about the pay . __eou__ could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? __eou__ yes , it might be worth it . i am not certain . __eou__ i think i'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you .
is my hair done yet ? __eou__ yeah , i just need to make the final touches . __eou__ how long until you're finished ? __eou__ i'm finished . what do you think ? __eou__ i like my hair so much . __eou__ do you really ? __eou__ it's beautiful . __eou__ well , thank you very much . __eou__ how much is it for my hair ? __eou__ you owe me $ 55 . __eou__ thanks for everything . __eou__ you are very welcome . come back again .
i have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! __eou__ there certainly are a lot . can you choose a favorite ? __eou__ vanilla with toppings is my favorite . __eou__ is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? __eou__ no way ! do you have a flavors you don't like ? __eou__ i don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it . __eou__ i agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . __eou__ i saw garlic ice cream on the menu once . __eou__ i think that would be horrible ! __eou__ i think i'll stick with a more traditional choice today !

how was your date recently ? __eou__ not too bad . it is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . __eou__ i guess so . going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . __eou__ she said she wanted to go dutch in dating . __eou__ yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . __eou__ but i am still traditional , so i felt weird when she paid for herself . __eou__ forget about it ! __eou__ are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? __eou__ it will be a long story . we have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . that is the sort of thing i can not bear .
how was your first date , david ? are you satisfied with jane ? __eou__ it was all right . she , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . __eou__ yes , so i think she is suitable for you . __eou__ but , well ... what i want to say is ... __eou__ stop acting like this . say away ! __eou__ her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . i can not accept that . __eou__ what did she say ? __eou__ she said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . __eou__ give her up .
how about going to dance this evening , jane ? you will find that the night life of this city is very interesting ! __eou__ good idea . there is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music . __eou__ ( in the club ) look at those people in the dance floor , they are so crazy . __eou__ that's rock and roll with fast tempo . __eou__ i like the slow dance . i am good at rumba and waltz . __eou__ take it easy . the time for slow dance is the middle part of the party . __eou__ let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage . __eou__ ok , follow me . __eou__ listen , it is waltz . i like the elegant step of the old styles . __eou__ may i ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ ( when they are dancing ) you dance gracefully !
what's your favourite steps ? __eou__ it's hard to say . but i do love waltz very much . __eou__ how about rumba ? __eou__ to tell the truth , i don't like it . __eou__ really ? you must like tango , right ? __eou__ oh , it's really beautiful , but i just can't dance it well . __eou__ don't be so modest . i'm sure you can dance it very well . let's dance it now . __eou__ ok . i'll have a try . __eou__ oh , you dance it so well . __eou__ thank you for your compliment . __eou__ i think i'm your lucky fellow .
how do you like waltz ? __eou__ it's very nice , i like it very much . __eou__ may i invite you for the first dance ? __eou__ my pleasure . but i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer . __eou__ in fact , i took up dancing quite recently , too . __eou__ oh , really ? but you're doing the tango wonderfully well . __eou__ i'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . it's lucky that i got a partner . __eou__ thank you for your compliments . it's just that you are a good leader . do you like the samba and waltz ? __eou__ yes . and what dances do you like best ? __eou__ waltz is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances . __eou__ oh , the music has stopped . thank you for the dance . __eou__ my pleasure . let's go and have a drink . __eou__ fine .
excuse me , miss . i'm bob . __eou__ i'm amy . how do you do ? __eou__ i'm very glad to meet you . may i have this dance with you ? __eou__ certainly ! i suppose you dance often . __eou__ no , i don't often dance . isn't this a wonderful party ? __eou__ yes , i'm glad i have come . __eou__ how do you like fox-trot ? __eou__ i like it very much . __eou__ you dance beautifully . __eou__ thank you . it's lucky that i have got a good partner . __eou__ thank you .
how's the weather today ? __eou__ it's cloudy . __eou__ is it going to rain today ? __eou__ i doubt it . __eou__ but i heard it might rain .
david , have you watched the 82nd oscar awards ceremony ? avatar got the award of visual effect . the movie sounds great ! __eou__ you are so old-fashioned . i have already watched it last week in cinema . __eou__ how was it ? __eou__ its 3d animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . __eou__ it is said that the hurt locker got the award of best picture . what do you think about this ? __eou__ well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award .
you always stick to your pc recently . are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? __eou__ for me , the times of chatting online has gone . __eou__ what the hell are you doing now ? __eou__ i opened my blog today . in order to have more visitors , i have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . __eou__ what's new with you ? __eou__ do you still remember justin ? __eou__ of course , he was our monitor in college . how is him now ? __eou__ he seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . i found his blogs were a little sad . __eou__ let me see . what a moving poem !
david , recently i established a travelling forum , and now i want to make a plan to hold the first activity . where can we go for this time ? __eou__ how many members are there in your forum ? __eou__ a dozen . __eou__ i think we can visit west lake . the landscapes are attractive . it is said that just as there is paradise in heaven , there are su thou and hang thou on earth . __eou__ it's surely worth going to . there are ten famous spots there . __eou__ what can we do next after locating the place ? __eou__ inform my members to prepare for the travelling . and then we can discuss about the travelling costs .
fred , can you tell me how i can open my qq zone ? __eou__ click your right key of mouse and choose qq zone . __eou__ well , i have to provide some of my information , right ? __eou__ yep ! the nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here . __eou__ all information is filled in and now i can design my zone . __eou__ you can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone . __eou__ now everything is ok . i can write my blog , right ? __eou__ certainly . __eou__ ( half an hour , janice begins shouting excitedly . ) what's the matter with you ? __eou__ look ! david gives his following-comment on my first blog . he is my first visitor .

shall we sing with a karaoke ? __eou__ great idea ! i do it every so often . __eou__ for us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . __eou__ yep . if you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? __eou__ i can not agree with you more . and if you are an awful one , that will be funny . __eou__ i remembered tom is always out of tune . we burst into laughter . __eou__ is that true ? shall we invite him to join with us ? __eou__ so tricky !
b , what's in your hand ? __eou__ sunday papers . i usually read them after coming back home from our company . __eou__ why do you read them ? __eou__ as you know , i am a sports fan . and these papers are famous for their sports section . so i will feel relaxed after grasping some information i am interested in . __eou__ i got your meaning . reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . __eou__ correct ! what about you , fred ? __eou__ i often go to the bar near our dorm when i am overtired . i am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . __eou__ don't overdo it . __eou__ shall we have a drink someday ? __eou__ i get drunk easily .

there will be a party in my company ; what shall i wear ? __eou__ is it formal or informal ? __eou__ i guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . __eou__ in that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . __eou__ you are right . what about shoes ? __eou__ the brown leather shoes are ok . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ don ’ t mention it .
do you like watching the winter olympic games ? __eou__ of course . it's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . don't you like watching it ? __eou__ of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . __eou__ that's true . for various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know , the low temperature may cause many problems . __eou__ yeah . what's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ? __eou__ when the olympic games started in modern times , only summer events were included . when it grew popular , there came the winter olympic games , which includes a variety of winter sports . __eou__ i see . then , what's your favorite winter sport ? __eou__ figure skating . in my eye , nothing beats it . __eou__ then you must know shen due and hao hongbo . __eou__ oh , i didn't expect you to know them . but yes , i love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . __eou__ you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too . __eou__ sure . what about you ? what do you like about the olympics ? __eou__ for me , the olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . it makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . __eou__ hey , young man , you are so deep today . __eou__ i always am . you just didn't notice .
belinda , i ’ m going to a party tonight . what shall i wear ? __eou__ is it formal or informal ? __eou__ i guess it ’ s formal . __eou__ then , you should dress well . __eou__ that ’ s right . __eou__ i think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you . __eou__ you are smart . __eou__ of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions . __eou__ you are right . what kind of shoes should i wear ? __eou__ the brown leather shoes go well with your trousers . __eou__ good idea . oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ? __eou__ it ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi . __eou__ ok .
the performance is amazing . i'm curious about how they did it . i mean the way they sing . __eou__ they must have practiced a lot . the perseverance has made them they are today . __eou__ so cool . someone gave me this flier at the exit . what's it about ? __eou__ let me have a look . well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . __eou__ oh , tell me about it . anything interesting ? __eou__ hmm ... oh , this one , ' the drunken beauty ' . this is a real classic . __eou__ ' the drunken beauty ' ? it's funny that we have ' sleeping beauty ' in my country . anyway , what's it about ? is the beauty a drunkard ? __eou__ of course not . she was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . they play was famous for its singing and dancing . __eou__ sure , people do that when they are drunk . what about the actress ? __eou__ she is an opera star in china . her teacher's teacher is mei landfang . __eou__ oh , i've heard about him before . he even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . __eou__ you are such an expert on it . i don't know that . __eou__ you know , interest is the best teacher . __eou__ so , want me to book the tickets again ? __eou__ please do that . i can't wait to come back again . the performance must be really amazing . __eou__ we can do that if you like . maybe next weekend . __eou__ that will be great .
we came too early . there're still three hours before the performance starts . __eou__ i know . sorry , i shouldn't have rushed you , but i just couldn't stay at home and wait . __eou__ never mind . what about taking a look around the theater ? __eou__ why not ? i'd love to do that . __eou__ here we go . there is a museum of the beijing opera art . ( they come to the museum of the beijing opera art . ) __eou__ wow . look at this . so delicate and beautiful . did ancient chinese people really wear them ? __eou__ not really . they are just opera costumes . do you like the embroidery ? __eou__ i surely do . they must have had advanced machines in ancient china to do that . __eou__ no , no , no . they are all handmade , girl . you know , the ancient chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . __eou__ unbelievable ! i could never do that . __eou__ very few can . that's why these clothes only appear in the museum . __eou__ listen ! some people are singing outside . is it the opera ? __eou__ oh , yes . i heard there was an opera fans club . they are probably practicing now . wanna have a look ? __eou__ yes , let's do it . __eou__ follow me . make sure not to interrupt them . __eou__ of course not . we don't do that .
i've heard that tom is going to move . __eou__ what ? are you sure about that ? __eou__ yeah , he is going to move next month . __eou__ where is he going ? __eou__ he is going to canada and to live with his son . __eou__ what a pity ! __eou__ why did you say that ? it's a good thing for him to live with his son . __eou__ i know that . but it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . you know i always appreciate tom's company . __eou__ me too . but anyway we hope he lives happily in the future .
there is a wonderful opera today . i'd like to see it . __eou__ i do not like the play with complicated plot . what's on today ? __eou__ ' the sound of music ' . this music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . it is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . __eou__ i know that . i have seen the film as the same title . andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from maria to a cheerful governess . __eou__ yes , you are right . i like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? __eou__ of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . __eou__ those young actors play the roles perfectly . __eou__ i hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . have you bought the tickets ? __eou__ no , i am asking you whether you will go to see it . __eou__ let's go . we'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant .
what happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ oh jackie ? we broke up last week . __eou__ that was a short relationship . you only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ it was actually a long two months . she was a psycho . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ she would be laughing one moment , and if i said something insensitive , she would start crying . i didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ she sounds very emotional . __eou__ she was a psycho , man . one time we were suppose to get together . i was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why i wasn't at her place . __eou__ were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ i thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . it was a misunderstanding . she was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ ok . you're right . she's a psycho . __eou__ i'm just glad it's over .
how was the party last night ? did you enjoy it ? __eou__ oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! it was the most awful evening i ’ ve ever had . __eou__ why ? what happened ? __eou__ well . mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . i waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . __eou__ what about the party ? __eou__ it was boring . the music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , i was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . __eou__ so how long did you stay ? __eou__ i left after the opening dance . i couldn ’ t wait to get out of there .
do you like plum blossoms ? __eou__ certainly . i prefer the winter and i love plum blossoms much more . __eou__ it's snowing heavily . what about taking a walk ? __eou__ seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? that's a good idea . let's go ! __eou__ what a heavy snow ! __eou__ take care ! don't slip down to the ground . __eou__ i've got it . i like the sound of stepping on the snow very much . __eou__ yes . very wonderful . __eou__ do you smell the sweet scent ? __eou__ yes . it should be the fragrance of plum blossoms . __eou__ the fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness .
what part did you get in the play this time ? __eou__ i got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . __eou__ i wish i had a character part . those are my favorite . __eou__ are you kidding ? you got the leading role . __eou__ i know , but i've done that so ay times . it's getting old . the leading guy is always the same macho a . __eou__ i would trade you if i could but i don't think i'd be a very convincing macho a . __eou__ next time . you are going to love your part . i've seen the script . __eou__ i do a good old lady . i wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while .
professor wang looks so handsome today . he is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie . __eou__ he always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie . __eou__ he ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . he gets different tie each day . __eou__ a light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . a perfect match ! __eou__ the tie is necessary for man . it makes you look so attractive in a super tie . __eou__ match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . __eou__ my father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . __eou__ my father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . my mother helps him with his tie every morning . __eou__ you mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife .
what is that you have there ? __eou__ aah ! close your eyes . you aren't supposed to see this . __eou__ ah ha ! i caught you . just let me peek . i won't tell anyone . __eou__ you can't peek ! this is a surprise . __eou__ how about one little hint ? __eou__ here's one little hint . if you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree . __eou__ that's a very good hint . __eou__ and please shut the door and lock it behind you !
do you have a family tradition at christmas time ? __eou__ we have so ay ! but my favorite happens at christmas eve . __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . __eou__ that's it ? that's the tradition ? __eou__ well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . __eou__ i guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . __eou__ you should be there some christmas eve .
look , here're two coins named kai yuan tong bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . these two coins were made in different periods of the tang dynasty . __eou__ how can you tell the difference ? from what i see , they look almost the same . __eou__ the one made in the early tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late tang period . look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . __eou__ yes , they are different ! but it's too professional . what i need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? __eou__ various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . we usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . we can judge it with naked eyes . __eou__ i see . by the way , china was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . did they issue their own coins in china ? __eou__ certainly , they did . liao coins and song coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the southern song and yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . the liao coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the mongolian tribe . let me look for one and show you . __eou__ if you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . i'd like to have one . it's interesting to see the integration of the han and mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal .

mark , you've been coming home late these days . what are you busy doing ? __eou__ nothing important . i've been working overtime lately . __eou__ how many hours do you work each day now ? __eou__ 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . __eou__ that's tough indeed ! do you think your health can afford ? __eou__ i don't care . i need money . __eou__ surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? __eou__ yes , i think so . when i work overtime i'm paid time and a half . __eou__ oh , yes . money comes faster in that way than otherwise . __eou__ but jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . __eou__ that's true .

what sports do you like to play ? __eou__ i like baseball and basketball . __eou__ how about football ? __eou__ in my country football is brand new , so i never learned the game when i was younger . __eou__ it's a very popular game in america . __eou__ yeah . i heard a lot about it . is it really that fun ? __eou__ for me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ are you a football player ? __eou__ no , i just for fun with my friends . we play two hand touch or flag football . we're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ what is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ i see . it's safer then right ? __eou__ exactly . we play every saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . if you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . __eou__ i'll give it a try . give me a call and let's go down together . __eou__ ok . i'll call you saturday morning . __eou__ great .

can i borrow your cds for our school dance ? __eou__ oh , you don't ask much , do you ? __eou__ i promise i will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . __eou__ i'll tell you what . your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . __eou__ that sounds fair . that's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . __eou__ not as fun though . a live band is way more exciting ! __eou__ our class doesn't have enough money . we already checked into it . __eou__ let me know with your next dance . i know a band that may give you a break for the publicity .
let's do something really nice for our family this christmas . __eou__ what did you have in mind ? __eou__ i don't know yet . __eou__ i just know i want to get out of the mindless gift trap . __eou__ i know what you mean . __eou__ i want to give a gift that is really meaningful . __eou__ or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . __eou__ or what only we are able to give them .
there's a double feature at the cinema this saturday . do you want to go with me ? __eou__ what are the movies that are playing ? __eou__ there's an action movie with harrison ford and a chick flick with susan abandon . __eou__ i've never seen a movie i don't like that had harrison ford in it . __eou__ so , is that a yes ? __eou__ yes . what time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? __eou__ it starts at one and yea , let's meet there . it's the cinema on the corner of lincoln and main . __eou__ great ! i have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater !
hi , i'm jake . i'm new to the choir . what's your name ? __eou__ hello , there , my name is tonia . __eou__ do you sing alto ? __eou__ actually , i can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . what about you . __eou__ looks like we both float back and forth . i'm baritone . __eou__ our bass section is really good . you're going to love singing with them . __eou__ i heard them warming up earlier . you're right . __eou__ it's good to have you in the group . we can always use a good baritone !
we'd like to have a look around your house ? __eou__ yes , of course , please follow me . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ this is our courtyard . __eou__ it's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ? __eou__ yes , about 46 square metres . __eou__ are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ very beautiful and very interesting . but why do you hang them in the tree ? __eou__ they don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . __eou__ very good idea . sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness .
hello , this is david . __eou__ hi david , this is marge . can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? __eou__ sure ! how about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? __eou__ that will work . __eou__ does five thirty work for you ? __eou__ that will be fine . what i have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . __eou__ is it the plans for my new house ? __eou__ yes . i just need to double check a few details with you .
what stresses you out the most ? __eou__ probably my parents . __eou__ how so ? __eou__ well , during school , they wanted good grades . then after i got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . and finally , they want me to get married . __eou__ you have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . __eou__ your parents are not like that ? __eou__ ever since i brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . __eou__ you're lucky . __eou__ what do you do to deal with the stress ? __eou__ not much i can do . it's always there . i sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . the stress always returns in the morning . __eou__ that sucks . you wanna go grab a beer ? __eou__ sure . sounds great . let's go .
it's going to strike 12 o'clock . let's get the firecrackers ready , rose . __eou__ aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? __eou__ well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . it's ok here . it would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . the habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . __eou__ fantastic ! the whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! __eou__ what other activities will you have tomorrow ? __eou__ quite a lot . the celebration of the new year has just started . the first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the north have jiaozi . afterward , we will make new year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . __eou__ do you bring some gifts along ? __eou__ that's for sure . fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . all this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . __eou__ is it the same practice for all families ? __eou__ not all the same nowadays i must say . many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . rose and i had a tour to singapore , malaysia , thailand and hong kong last year . we stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . __eou__ i really appreciate the way you chinese people exchange feelings . the holiday's long enough for you to relax . __eou__ well , for city dwellers , the spring festival is a holiday of seven days . while in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days .
jared , i just heard about your father . how is he doing ? __eou__ he's in the hospital resting . the doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet . __eou__ i'm so sorry to hear that . but this is a good hospital . i'm sure they will do whatever they can . __eou__ i hope so . __eou__ you must feel really worried right now . but you know your dad is a fighter . __eou__ yeah . i think my mom is the most worried . i'm basically worried about how she is doing . __eou__ where is she right now ? __eou__ she's in the hospital with my dad . i have to go back tonight . __eou__ hey , i'll go with you . __eou__ you don't have to . __eou__ it's really no problem . __eou__ ok . let's go right after dinner .
there is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . __eou__ what kind of food will they be serving ? __eou__ my favorite , mexican . and i've heard that the head chef is from san paulo . __eou__ it sounds like this is going to be authentic mexican food . __eou__ i can hardly wait ! __eou__ do you know the day they plan to open ? __eou__ i'll double check the announcement . __eou__ maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ?
bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 international tourism festival is around the corner . __eou__ we've heard about that festival before . it would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . __eou__ my pleasure . well , the festival is going to start on the third saturday of october , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . __eou__ what do you think we can see during the festival ? __eou__ i don't know what to suggest . there're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . one exciting program might be the ten thousand people cycling round the town . you can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . __eou__ i'd like to take the one that goes to the wild animal park . __eou__ then you can take route no . 5 . next i would suggest the international dragon boat race where you can watch lion dance , dragon boat racing , and many other water shows . __eou__ wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river .
i have an idea for christmas this year . __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ let's not exchange any gifts at all . __eou__ you big scrooge ! __eou__ hear me out . we can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it ! __eou__ but you may have some trouble convincing the kids . __eou__ actual 1y , it was their idea first . __eou__ now we know that they realize the real meaning of christmas .
i'll see you in sterlet , then . __eou__ where did you say ? __eou__ sterlet . it's spelt 0 , s , t , e , r , l , e , y . __eou__ right .
what a lovely day . the sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . it's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ great idea . unlike you , i just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . i do not want to get a tan because i look good in pale skin . __eou__ come on . getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ while the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most asia countries . __eou__ that is a really interesting fact . __eou__ i will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( at the beach ) my bag is so heavy . let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ good idea . it is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ i can't wait to play in the water . my feet are burning when i stand on the sand .
let's go see pandas ! the news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week . __eou__ great ! i would like to see cute pandas , too . __eou__ how can we get there ? __eou__ we can take the met and get off at the zoo station . __eou__ ok ! let's go . __eou__ ( at the zoo ) wow ! this zoo is really huge . __eou__ yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . it is the biggest zoo in taiwan . __eou__ look at the map . it has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects . __eou__ where can find the pandas ? i think we are here to see the pandas . __eou__ we have to go to the mammal area . we are at the gate right now . we need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn . __eou__ it should take at least 20 minutes to get there . are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ?
i found out when jim's birthday is . it's this friday . __eou__ let's plan a surprise party for him ! __eou__ can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ? __eou__ that's easy . anything else ? __eou__ will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ? __eou__ won't he be surprised ! __eou__ i don't know how old he is though . __eou__ that's o . k . maybe his wife will spill the beans !
hello . are you a friend of helen's ? __eou__ actually , a friend of a friend . __eou__ my name is phil . what's yours ? __eou__ alecia . __eou__ have you tried these little ditties ? they are really good . __eou__ thanks . they look delicious . __eou__ can i get you some punch ? i was just going to go get myself some . __eou__ that would be great . i would love some .

i'm really curious . what is it like doing housework all day for a living ? __eou__ it's a little like being a mom , only i get paid for it ! __eou__ i still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . most women would rather hire a maid . __eou__ that's exactly why my business is doing so well ! __eou__ how ay clients do you have already ? __eou__ well , i've been in business for one month now and i have ten clients . __eou__ wow . too bad i don't have a clue about housework . __eou__ if you ever need a job , let me know . i can always train you .
do you like flowers ? __eou__ of course , i like . __eou__ what's your favorite flower ? __eou__ forsythia . it's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival . __eou__ spring is a lively season . __eou__ yes . how about you ? __eou__ i admire plum blossoms very much . it seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter . __eou__ you have a perfect taste ! __eou__ it is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . i admire the bravery of plum blossoms . __eou__ but it used to be ignored by many people . __eou__ the bright people will remember it forever . __eou__ well , it's snowing . let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing .

why are you so quiet ? __eou__ my girlfriend just broke up with me . __eou__ you must feel terrible now . __eou__ yeah . __eou__ i remember my first break up . it was the worst feeling in the world . i was crying everyday for three months . and slowly , it got better . i know you'll feel better too . __eou__ you've been through this too ? __eou__ yeah . i remember it very clearly . the pain makes it easy to remember . i know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . __eou__ but it hurts too much . __eou__ i know it's painful , but it's only temporary . after the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . __eou__ what if i don't want to find another girl ? __eou__ you'll change your mind . look at everyone in the world . they all break up and move on . the faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . __eou__ you're right . __eou__ i also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . you know she didn't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? __eou__ yeah . thanks for the talk . __eou__ i'll give you a call later . we should hang out . it's good to be around people . __eou__ ok . i'll talk to you later .

martha . what's wrong ? why are you crying ? __eou__ jake just broke up with me . __eou__ i'm sorry . when did this happen ? __eou__ yesterday . i didn't even know it was coming . he just told me he found someone else . __eou__ what a jerk . he doesn't deserve you . __eou__ but it still hurts . i thought i loved him . __eou__ he didn't treat you that well either . maybe you don't want to hear this , but i think you can do better . __eou__ better or worse , it doesn't matter . i had a lot of feelings for him . i really liked him __eou__ it must be really painful . i remember when josh and i broke up . i was crying for a week . __eou__ i know . i'll get over him . my first break up was painful because i was naive . __eou__ exactly . you'll find someone again . you should get your mind off of this . let's go shopping . __eou__ maybe tomorrow . i don't feel like it tonight . __eou__ how about coffee down the street ? __eou__ sure .

i've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? __eou__ yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . factories don't emit it directly into the air . it's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and voc emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . __eou__ sorry ? what does voc stand for ? __eou__ oh , vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . that's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . __eou__ so , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? __eou__ well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties .
jack , what do you think about the election ? __eou__ i think the campaign is a blockbuster . __eou__ how many people have flung their hats into the ring ? __eou__ finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . __eou__ who do you think will be elected ? __eou__ it's hard to say . they all had an active campaign to round up the votes . __eou__ i think mr . white would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech . __eou__ maybe . who knows ?
is the lake very polluted ? __eou__ well , i wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . __eou__ are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? __eou__ yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first .
have you heard that tom and his wife divorced ? __eou__ i didn't hear that . but i can deduce the reason . __eou__ really ? say it ! __eou__ tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . he spends all his time gambling in the casino . and his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . is that right ? __eou__ yeah , quite right . gambling broke up a happy family . __eou__ yeah ! gambling is often a curse . by gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . __eou__ besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . __eou__ in a word , gambling is a vice . we should be away from it .
it rumored that jean is fooling around with another woman's husband . __eou__ you gossip ! what's the basis of your opinion ? __eou__ someone declared that he saw it . __eou__ i don't believe it . jean is such a kind lady . how could she do this ? __eou__ who knows ? you can't judge a book by its cover . __eou__ maybe !
i could get along fine without all the office politics . __eou__ what's going on ? __eou__ there is a position i've had my eye on for several months now and i had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . __eou__ so what happened ? __eou__ we were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so ay new employees . __eou__ so what does that have to do with this position ? __eou__ someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the management position i wanted . __eou__ all under the precept of keeping the funding ? that stinks .
julia , what do you think of the network ? __eou__ network is omnipresent nowadays . it's quite convenient for people . you see , we can download music and information from the internet ; i can study from it , too . and the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . __eou__ yeah , you are right . internet makes our lives easier . but it's a two-blade sword . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i mean internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . for example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc . __eou__ i agree . but i think although it has some negative effects , on the whole internet does more good to us than harm . __eou__ yeah , you are right . but we have to know how to make good use of it .
hi , mr . wang . do you feel like going boating with me ? __eou__ sounds interesting , i haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ? __eou__ how about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ sure . where shall i meet you ? __eou__ at the gate of the park . __eou__ great . i look forward to meeting you . __eou__ see you then . __eou__ see you .
hey . steven . you have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? __eou__ i like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . and i don't think i should waste money just because i have much of it . __eou__ but i found you always hate to part with your money . look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! __eou__ oh , the car is old but still in good condition . i just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . __eou__ but ... but ... __eou__ but what ? just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . __eou__ maybe you are right .

what's up , buddy ? you look so upset . __eou__ i just broke up with a girl . why didn't she understand that i loved her ? __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that . what's your conflict ? __eou__ i don't know . she always said i didn't love her , but i did . __eou__ did you think about talking to her again ? maybe she is waiting for your call . __eou__ i have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . __eou__ come on , guy . maybe she isn't your right person .
mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it ’ s ok . it seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really ? that is great news . what does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . i am impressed with how smart and humorous . __eou__ oh , it ’ s love at first sight .

i heard that kevin got divorced . is that true ? __eou__ not so bad , but kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__ what ? __eou__ his wife always complained that kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__ poor kevin , we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__ yeah , i agree with you . but you know , it ’ s just one of those things .

hey . owen ! have you gone on your family vacation yet ? __eou__ oh , yes . i got so tired . my son began to cry the moment we got on the train . it was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . __eou__ didn't you bring his favorite toy ? __eou__ yes , we did . fortunately we put his teddy bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . __eou__ where did you go ? you've got a beautiful tan . __eou__ my wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . i think vacation in summer is not good . __eou__ you must have had a great time . most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . __eou__ yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . __eou__ his friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . __eou__ and i taught him how to swim in the sea . it was fun and made him braver than before . after we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom .
which team has won ? __eou__ neither . the game ended in two all . __eou__ but i still think ac milan's defence seems better organized . __eou__ but the brazilian is tougher .
in spring , people are feeling refreshed . they take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . they feel they are full of spirits and energy . __eou__ women in particular . they are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . __eou__ well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . no one would like to stay in the open air for long . __eou__ that's true . in summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . __eou__ i myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . __eou__ in autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . __eou__ and you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! people are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! __eou__ well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? __eou__ well , it's hard to say . for the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , i think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . __eou__ maybe you are right .
what are your hobbies , mr . green ? __eou__ i like collecting stamps . __eou__ but it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , you're right . what do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ i usually play chess with my friends . but i like playing basketball best . __eou__ do you play basketball well ? __eou__ no , i'm not very good at it . i play just for the fun of it . __eou__ shall we have a game together some day ? __eou__ ok , that'd be very nice .
hey , mary , what's up ? __eou__ just so so . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ oh , that's exciting . what does this guy look like ? is he hot ? __eou__ well , i didn't think so at first . but as we started talking , i found him extremely funny and witty . i couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! and we have so much in common . we like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love chinese food ! i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . __eou__ it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ there's nothing definite i think . i don't have a list or anything , but when i first meet somebody , i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar helping me spot new friends . __eou__ well , that's something i've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend , i would say honesty . __eou__ i agree . you can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ yeah , i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i don't need fair-weather friends either .
what do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ i am a girl of many interests . i like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos . __eou__ what kind of dance do you like ? __eou__ i like rumba and tango . __eou__ great . i am not interested in chinese chess . it is too difficult for me . __eou__ you can learn chinese checkers or military chess . both of them are much easier . __eou__ ok , i will try . as for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? __eou__ yes , it is . but it is full of fun and knowledge . what about you , what do you like to do as hobby ? __eou__ i like gardening . i take care of them everyday . i like those flowers and the swing in my garden . if the weather is nice , i would like to lie on the lawn . __eou__ sounds pleasant .
mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . it seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really ? that is great news . what does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . i am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ oh , it's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ? __eou__ he didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ oh , david . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what should i do if he doesn't call me ? __eou__ come on , mary , you're a total catch . i bet he will call you . don't worry . __eou__ thank you , david . you're always so encouraging . __eou__ that's what friends are for .
what do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ i like taking photos . __eou__ really ? __eou__ yes , look at the photos i took . __eou__ they are beautiful . you did a good job . __eou__ thank you for saying so . __eou__ as a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer .
hey mark . what are you doing ? __eou__ just watching some tv . __eou__ anything interesting on ? __eou__ not really . just watching the sports highlight on espn . __eou__ so i take it you're pretty bored too . __eou__ just killing time until i find something to do . what are you going to do ? __eou__ it's saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . what's wrong with us ? __eou__ you wanna shoot some hoops ? __eou__ i already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . __eou__ where's your girlfriend ? i thought you were going out with her today . __eou__ she's out shopping with her friends . __eou__ let's go to starbucks and think of something to do then . __eou__ aright . do you have any cigarettes ? __eou__ i only have a couple left . why don't you pick some up on the way . __eou__ ok . see you there in about 30 minutes . __eou__ aright . see you there .
what do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ don't believe him . he's a liar . __eou__ we cannot expect politics to be true anyway . __eou__ exactly .
my friend jean is very beautiful . __eou__ what's her figure ? __eou__ perfect , and i like her charming eyes too . __eou__ what's the color of her eyes ? __eou__ dark blue .
hi , tina , it's joe . __eou__ hi , joe . __eou__ what's the weather like there today ? __eou__ it's really cold . it snowed all day and the school closed early . __eou__ what's the temperature ? __eou__ it's 20 degrees below zero now . it was even colder this morning . __eou__ have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? __eou__ i was watching the news a little earlier . they said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . __eou__ i really don't like the winter . i wish it were summer . __eou__ me too . how's the weather where you are ? __eou__ it's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . i heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow .

what a beautiful day ! __eou__ it is really gorgeous out today . i remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain . __eou__ i heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees fahrenheit today . __eou__ really ? that's unusual for october , isn't it ? __eou__ well , you could never tell about the weather here in new york . __eou__ yes , that's true . still , it's hard to believe . yesterday our high was only 50 degrees fahrenheit .
tony looks very handsome in the suit . __eou__ he prefers suits to jackets . __eou__ judge from his look , he's a very serious person . __eou__ as a matter of fact , he is .

when do you usually go to the movies ? __eou__ i usually go in my free time on the weekends . how about you ? __eou__ the movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . i like to go to the movies during the week . __eou__ that's true . and sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well .
i like watching comedies , like ' boat ' . do you like watching comedies too ? __eou__ not really , i like watching horror movies , like ' the unborn . ' __eou__ you like horror movies ? i don't like them because they're too scary ! i like comedies because i love to laugh . __eou__ i like horror movies because i like to be scared .
well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . maybe we're just different kinds of people . __eou__ yeah it's too bad ... but actually i think i know what to do . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ we can go to a horror movie , and i'll hold your hand so you don't get scared . __eou__ you mean ... like on a second date ? __eou__ of course ! or are you still too scared ! __eou__ no way ! that sounds great !

" i think jim carry is really funny . __eou__ oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . i think jim carry is one of the funniest comedians ever . __eou__ i agree . but even though i like comedies , i usually prefer more serious films . my favorite movie is " titanic . "
you talked like the terminator for two months ? wow , i think you liked that movie even more than i liked ' titanic . ' why did you like ' terminator ' so much ? __eou__ well , ' terminator ' is a really great action movie , and i like action movies because they're exciting . __eou__ isn't ' terminator ' really violent ? i usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out . __eou__ it is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out . __eou__ hmm ... i don't know . even though it may not be gory , i think it would still totally freak me out .
can you take part in our picnic this saturday ? __eou__ that would be fine . where are you going ? __eou__ we plan to go to a forest in the suburb . there is a beautiful river there . we can do some fishing . __eou__ great . __eou__ and don't forget your fishing tackle . __eou__ ok . i like fishing very much .
you like titanic ? that movie is so cheesy . __eou__ it's not cheesy ! it's romantic . when it first came out , i saw it in the theaters five times in one week . __eou__ really ? well the special effects might have been good in 1997 , but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy . __eou__ alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . but come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ? __eou__ actually , i have to admit that you're right . i like some pretty cheesy movies too . i love arnold schwarzenegger action flicks , especially " terminator .

good morning , you look very tired . __eou__ yes , i nearly didn't sleep last night . __eou__ did you hold a party or something else yesterday ? __eou__ no , i just watched supergirl , and it began too late in the night . i was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock . __eou__ i don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges . __eou__ the contestants are different . these girls perform in free styles . __eou__ do you have much time watching tv ? __eou__ i think less than 3 hours . this year i didn't watch any entertainment programs . too many ads between the programs . i prefer listening to the radio . __eou__ i don't like ads , either . but ads could bring big profits to the tv station . __eou__ if they could make beautiful ads , i could bear .
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ i went a global warming rally . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . you should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? __eou__ i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ i had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
did you watch the final last night ? my favorite singer won ! __eou__ oh , i love him too . he not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__ yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . he then tried at another two auditions . __eou__ he had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . and that's when i started to notice him . __eou__ me too . __eou__ before he made the top three , i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out . __eou__ yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ? __eou__ absolutely . that's why when he entered the final , i was so excited . __eou__ he really did a great job in the finale , especially in the pk round . he performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . __eou__ and the host announced that he won it all !
the air quality in this city is horrendous . the pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! __eou__ exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . __eou__ on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__ as much as i love this city , i think i'm going to find a greener city to live in . living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__ i know what you mean . however , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . if it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . __eou__ what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? __eou__ it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . __eou__ i see , so it's similar to global warming ? __eou__ they're related to one another , yes . __eou__ i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . __eou__ people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . they've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . __eou__ people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . __eou__ i think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
hello __eou__ hi angela , it's dan . __eou__ hi b . how are you ? __eou__ good . __eou__ i called you yesterday . did you get my message ? __eou__ yes , i was taking a shower when you called . i saw that you called and i tried to call you back , but i think your phone was off . __eou__ no problem . i wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . you're still coming to the wedding with me , right ? __eou__ oh , is that next week ? __eou__ yes . did you forget ? __eou__ no , of course not . i already bought them a present . __eou__ that's good . i want to invite megan also . next time you see her , can you tell her for me . __eou__ sure . does she know your friend ? __eou__ yes , i think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . i'm not exactly sure how they know each other . __eou__ are we all going to drive together ? __eou__ yes . i'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get megan .
i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ i think you're right . there needs to be an international response to this problem ?

william told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? what exactly did he say ? __eou__ he said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . it's really so sad ! but when i talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . __eou__ it didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? what did you tell him ? __eou__ i asked if there was anything i could do to help his family , and i told him that i could be a shoulder for him to cry on . __eou__ well i hate to tell you this jen , but both of william's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago .
the weather is terrible . __eou__ yeah . it's been raining a lot these days . __eou__ i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . __eou__ have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? __eou__ i saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . __eou__ that sucks so much . what are we going to do ? __eou__ i'm getting pretty bored . we should do something despite the rain . __eou__ i'm with you . what do you have in mind ? __eou__ i haven't been to the mall in a long time . let's go there . __eou__ that sounds good . they have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie . __eou__ great . i'll stop by your place now . __eou__ ok . don't forget to bring your umbrella . the rain can start up again anytime .

the weather is really miserable . it has been raining hard all day long . __eou__ yes , it's so cold . __eou__ do you think the rain is going to let up soon ? __eou__ yes , i think so . the rainy season will be over soon . __eou__ how long does the rainy season last ? __eou__ about two months . __eou__ i can hardly stand these wet and cold days . it seems that it doesn't bother you very much . __eou__ i'm used to this kind of days . __eou__ but i prefer warm weather . __eou__ spring will come soon . and we will have some pleasant weather then . __eou__ i hope so .
what do you do when you are angry ? __eou__ i usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . __eou__ that ’ s smart . what do you usually do to relieve your anger ? __eou__ something like listening to music is a good idea . __eou__ oh , what kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ classic . something that could calm your mind . __eou__ i think that might work for me as well . __eou__ working out is another good way to relieve anger . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk .
the time has come to say goodbye . __eou__ so soon . it seems as if you just got here . __eou__ i feel that way , too . but all good things must come to an end , as they say . __eou__ it certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . __eou__ i've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around . __eou__ it was fun for me , too . it gave me a chance to get away from my routine . __eou__ you'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? __eou__ oh , yes . i should be there some time next spring . __eou__ i'll be expecting you then .

life's so boring . __eou__ well , most of the time it is , i guess . __eou__ what do you think will make you happy ? __eou__ i think money will make me happy . __eou__ you heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness . __eou__ it will for me . then i can do all the things i want to do . __eou__ you'll get bored eventually . __eou__ then i can find something new to do . if i don't have to worry about money , then i don't have to work . __eou__ that's true , i guess . if i didn't have to work , i think i would be happy . __eou__ you see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities .
well , jeff , that was a very productive meeting , i thought . you had some really great ideas in there ! __eou__ really ? well , thanks for saying so . __eou__ no , i mean it . look , are you hungry ? shall we go get something to eat ? __eou__ sure . why not ? __eou__ ok , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner . __eou__ ok .

have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? __eou__ do you mean lying to people for their good ? __eou__ yes . is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? __eou__ it's hard to say . i mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . __eou__ but sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth . __eou__ i know . if you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it .
have you got any hobbies ? __eou__ yes . i'm fond of playing the chess and i'm very keen on playing cards . __eou__ which is easier to learn ? __eou__ both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places .

have you considered upgrading your system ? __eou__ yes , but i'm not sure what exactly i would need . __eou__ you could consider adding a painting program to your software . it would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . __eou__ that would be a definite bonus . __eou__ you might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__ how can we do that ? __eou__ you'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . and you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . do you have a cd-rom drive ? __eou__ no . __eou__ then you might want to add a cd-rom drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on cds . __eou__ that sounds great . thanks .

that new sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . __eou__ yeah.it is the very latest in digital video cameras . __eou__ i can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . __eou__ getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.they come with a lot of inviting functions . __eou__ such as ? __eou__ they offer clearer and sharper images . many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . __eou__ they are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . __eou__ right ! anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . __eou__ what does this mean ? __eou__ this means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital tv or your computer . __eou__ i can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . __eou__ sure ! and without any conversion process or loss of quality ! you quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . __eou__ what special effects ? __eou__ like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . __eou__ that's great ! __eou__ with the development of the broad band internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners . __eou__ so everybody's getting video mail .

good afternoon , mrs . brown . i've come to see mr . brown . __eou__ good afternoon , mr . green . __eou__ is he in ? __eou__ i'm sorry , but he's not in , he's gone out on business . __eou__ oh ! i just drop in on him for a chat . __eou__ please come in for a cup of coffee . __eou__ no , thank you . please tell him to phone me when he comes back .
it's time to leave the office for the night . firstly i log off my computer , then i set the electronic security system . __eou__ that's pretty advanced . __eou__ now i'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . __eou__ is that where you park ? __eou__ yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . please get in . __eou__ thank you . where is your key ? __eou__ there's no need , i have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . __eou__ that's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . __eou__ using gps i can rely on this to direct me home . now i just need to find my e-card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . __eou__ pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . __eou__ maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? __eou__ here it is , and here we are . __eou__ when i turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . __eou__ i have to get home , but i don't need all of this fancy technology , i think i'll just walk .
it's getting late , and i have to go now . __eou__ we're sorry you have to leave . __eou__ please excuse me , won't you ? __eou__ certainly . come back soon .
merry christmas , mr . wang . i would like to give you the book i specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days . __eou__ thanks , mr . white . that's very kind of you . __eou__ i hope it will be of some use to you . __eou__ i am sure it will . it'll be of great help in carrying on the work i have done so far . __eou__ that will be great .
hi , tina , i've got good news . i have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with abc company . they informed me to go to the final round next monday . it looks very promising . __eou__ that is awesome . congratulations ! i know you can make it . __eou__ thanks . let's go for a celebration this evening . are you free ? __eou__ yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . say 5 pm , ok ? __eou__ no problem . see you ! __eou__ see you !
could you tell me something about the mid-autumn festival ? i find it also very interesting . __eou__ ok . it falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . it is said that there is a beautiful goddess chang'e on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . she is always expecting to see her husband again . so , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . __eou__ so , i understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . __eou__ you are right . in china , ' round ' is an auspicious word . the moon cakes are in round shape . __eou__ is it official ? __eou__ it was not in the past . but from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival .
hi . bob ! we've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . so why don't we take it easy this weekend ? __eou__ okay ! what do you suggest ? __eou__ how about seeing a play ? i hear hamlet is on at the national theater . __eou__ is that so ? why not ? __eou__ ( looking at a newspaper ) oh , dear me ! there's no performance at the national theater this weekend . so we have to go to cinema instead . __eou__ what's on ? __eou__ let me see .. um . gone with the wind . it is on at six cinemas on saturday night . __eou__ that sounds interesting . which is the nearest ? __eou__ ah . the royal , i think . __eou__ what time does it start ? __eou__ why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? it is convenient to us , i think . __eou__ but we won't have enough time for dinner . __eou__ do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? __eou__ ah ... i fancy going to the later show . __eou__ then , there's a 9:30 show . __eou__ that's okay , i think . __eou__ all right .
mr . wilson , here's a present for you . __eou__ oh , you are so nice . what a lovely scarf . __eou__ i hope you will like it . __eou__ of course , i like it very much . thank you .
the spring festival is drawing close . by then we will have five days off . i am expecting it . __eou__ can you tell me something about the spring festival ? __eou__ just like you celebrate christmas , we celebrate our lunar new year's day , the spring festival . it is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together . __eou__ christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year . __eou__ christmas has more religious nature , while our spring festival is a more traditional holiday . on the new year's eve , we have a big dinner called ' family reunion dinner ' . one of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . after that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching tv , or playing cards . __eou__ what are the children doing ? __eou__ they usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . __eou__ i heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year . __eou__ perhaps it is like what people told you . at 24 hours midnight , the time when the new year really comes , we exchange ' happy new year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' lucky money . __eou__ who will get the money ? __eou__ of course the children .
we are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center . __eou__ that's great . __eou__ now let's get things ready . __eou__ don't worry . there are all kinds of things in the center . __eou__ that's much more convenient . we don't even have to bring the flavorings .
what's that , a new video game ? __eou__ nope ! it's the latest generation of pad ! you won't believe what it can do . __eou__ for instance ? __eou__ it has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . it also plays mp3 files , which i can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . __eou__ wow ! anything else ? __eou__ this one comes with its own folding keyboard . it has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . i can use the stylus to write on the screen . __eou__ what if i want to use cd-roms or floppies ? __eou__ just plug in a peripheral cd or floppy drive and you're ready to go !
when will the ceremony begin ? __eou__ the ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . after the ceremony , there's a reception . by the way , do you know why they have chosen september 9th for their wedding ceremony ? __eou__ no idea . __eou__ as in english , chinese also has some lucky numbers . the number 9 stands for perpetuity in chinese .
it's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . __eou__ how can i forget my old friend ? __eou__ my best wishes to you and the bride ! __eou__ thank you very much .
mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country . __eou__ really ? he is so great . __eou__ you don't want to join him ? __eou__ surely i want . it's quite popular nowadays . __eou__ yes , and i want to have a try .
what is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? __eou__ i wasn't quite prepared for the view of the earth as we left . it was just awe-inspiring . it emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . i wasn't quite prepared for that . it's inevitably etched in my memory . __eou__ when viewing the earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? __eou__ detached . you're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . your only link to reality is the earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__ there're a lot of suspicions that the international space station is never going to become reality . is it going to be some future project that never happens ? __eou__ i believe it's certainly for real . it without question has suffered a lot of delays . but there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in december . it is a reality . it has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . __eou__ there were a lot of talks during the bush administration about a not too distant future mars mission . it seemed to fizzle out . do you think that this shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to mars sooner ? __eou__ i hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . but only time will tell . __eou__ you had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . how long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? i just can't wait . __eou__ if i were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . i strongly support ordinary people going into space . unfortunately , i don't think it will be in the near future .
are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? __eou__ no , not usually . most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . __eou__ where do they go ? __eou__ either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid __eou__ they go to the home of the bride ? __eou__ why do you ask ? __eou__ the chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . __eou__ oh ! in our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . so the reception is held at her home . __eou__ that's very expensive for the family of the bride . __eou__ many american furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding . __eou__ tell me something about the bridal bouquet . isn't it the custom to throw it ? __eou__ yes . when the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . the bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . the one who does will be the next one married . __eou__ maybe i'll be the one .
i'm reading an interesting report on mars . __eou__ oh , what does it say ? does it say water could still exist under the surface of mars ? __eou__ absolutely ! it says there is water on mars buried beneath the surface . it's just a matter of how deep it is . __eou__ then could the soil on mars somehow be fertile enough to groh simple plants ? __eou__ the soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . and it would need to be protected from the uv radiation . __eou__ actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on mars for an extended period of time . does nasa have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? __eou__ i'm not sure nasa has built any portable habitats for extended stays on mars , but they have looked at various designs . __eou__ one of the most exciting things about mars is that there could have bean life on it . what are your personal opinions on the life on mars theory ? __eou__ well , i'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . it's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . __eou__ but maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . __eou__ i'm skeptical . mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . it also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . it is so different from what we have on earth , you know . __eou__ i'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there . __eou__ but there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects .
is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ? __eou__ i am sorry , sir.all the tickets have been sold out . __eou__ what a shame . will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ? __eou__ sorry , sir . the only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . __eou__ that's fine . i want 2 tickets .
oh , ralph , i heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . disasters have happened before . if the spaceship were out of order . . . __eou__ you should be optimistic about this . things have taken a good turn . you should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . __eou__ but is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? __eou__ it's once in blue moon . __eou__ what do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? __eou__ the main one is radiation . there are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . the first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . the second , less harmful , comes from the so-called van allen belts .
i want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert . __eou__ sure . how do you like your seats ? __eou__ ordinary one , please . __eou__ ok , here are your tickets in row 13 . __eou__ i think they are too far from the stage . i want two in row 6 . __eou__ that's fine . but you have to pay another $ 10 .
are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? __eou__ no , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . but not too much . as the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . __eou__ but i heard that our milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . if galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? __eou__ well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . however , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . __eou__ wow , you're really informative . thanks a lot . __eou__ you're welcome .
do you have anything to do after this ? __eou__ no , i don't . __eou__ shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ? __eou__ that sounds like a good idea . __eou__ i know a very interesting place . __eou__ oh , do you ? good .
recently , there prevails ' net love ' ! __eou__ what's net love ? __eou__ two people chat on the net and step by step fall into love ! it's net love . __eou__ ridiculous ! they haven't met ! maybe they're the same sex ! __eou__ maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . he's called ' beast ' ? __eou__ how could you know ? __eou__ i watched the screen display ! __eou__ do you know ' he ' is ms . rebecca ! __eou__ it's typical net love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! ha ! __eou__ impossible !
i hear you are moving to dalian . __eou__ yes . i found a very good job down here . __eou__ well , we'll certainly miss you here . __eou__ i am going to miss you , too . __eou__ let's keep in touch . __eou__ ok . i will write to you as soon as i get there .
i just got a letter from an old high school buddy . __eou__ really ? that's nice . __eou__ he usually keeps me posted . __eou__ i've been completely out of touch with my old friends . __eou__ it's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much . __eou__ yes , people just seem to drift apart .
hi ! dear ! i'm waiting for you . __eou__ i know that . __eou__ you know , although we've chatted twice , i've been thinking of you already . __eou__ me too . i want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... __eou__ & you ? __eou__ look , i am playing the piano for you . __eou__ oh , thanks . i wanna see the real you . __eou__ sorry , i have no photo in my computer . and i have no scanner . i will show you later . __eou__ ok ! before that i'll take this one as you . __eou__ ha ! she is too little . __eou__ cute , like you . __eou__ i want to tell you that i like you __eou__ me too . send you a kiss ... __eou__ thx .
do you have a bf ? __eou__ yes , i had a bf before . __eou__ why you say bf before ? __eou__ we parted from each other last month . __eou__ have you got a new one ? __eou__ mmmm , no . how about you ? __eou__ i am single , i have no real of , only an e-gf , that is you . __eou__ haha , so you are my e-bf . __eou__ i like you . do you agree to be my of ? __eou__ mmmm . .. ok , let's try to be . __eou__ wow ! blablablabla . . . __eou__ hey ! what is it ? __eou__ i am flying like a bird . __eou__ ll __eou__ i am so happy . i want to drink a cup of champagne . __eou__ i have no champagne right now . how about this ? __eou__ it's ok , so i send you this . __eou__ is it made of chocolate ? __eou__ it's my heart ; it's made of what you like . __eou__ oh , i will have a sweet dream . __eou__ are you sleepy ? __eou__ a little bit . i have to go to sleep though i don't want to . __eou__ yes , i do not want to see ur sleeping in the office . __eou__ thx.bye for now . kisssssssssss . __eou__ c u here , honey .
tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the web to find a mate ? __eou__ i think that , as more people use the internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . __eou__ there are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . but how should you screen potential mates ? do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? __eou__ i would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . a lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . __eou__ can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the net ? __eou__ i'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . __eou__ besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? are people out there finding true and lasting love through the internet __eou__ well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in valentine's day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . __eou__ do you have any successful stories to share ? __eou__ yes , the couple that i highlighted at today's show met on match.com and they're getting married this summer .
how long have you been living in new york ? __eou__ oh , about two years now . __eou__ where do your parents live ? __eou__ they still live in shanghai where i was born . __eou__ do you write or call them very much ? __eou__ yes , i try to keep in touch with them .
hey , frank , there is that janet chick . __eou__ wow , what a great burd ! __eou__ she sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__ she's a real turn-on , alright ? __eou__ and look out she's dressed . __eou__ yeah , i noticed . she must be really loaded . __eou__ no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants . __eou__ lucky her . anyway , i think that is just as beautiful . __eou__ i think you've lost it . __eou__ well , that's my opinion . __eou__ i admit that she is much prettier than kate . __eou__ oh , there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly . __eou__ at least we agree on that . let's go and get a drink .
oh , hi , jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? __eou__ i'd love to , the movies are smash hit . __eou__ then let's go in . __eou__ i can't . i'm waiting for paul , but he's late . __eou__ i'll say the movie's starting in the minute . __eou__ i know . i wonder what's keeping him . __eou__ looks like he won't show up . he's done this before , hasn't he ? __eou__ yeah , a number of times . __eou__ what's he trying to pull anyway . __eou__ i don't know . but this is definitely the last straw . __eou__ maybe you should start seeing someone else . __eou__ you said it . ok , let's go in , sandy .
did you enjoy that new movie ? __eou__ that movie's just a lot of noise , same as simon . __eou__ oh , what happened , carole ? __eou__ i had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . __eou__ what ? i met him just before i took off from kitty's , he said he was coming . __eou__ kitty's ? he sure gets around , doesn't he ? __eou__ looks like it . so how did he handle it to ? __eou__ his excuse was familiar . he said his car died again . __eou__ i think that's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me . __eou__ i know . last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . __eou__ doesn't sound promising . __eou__ well , i think it's the time to pull the plug . __eou__ if you want i'll let him know if i run into him . __eou__ thanks anyway , but i'll do it , rebecca . let's get to class .
it is really exciting news . __eou__ what news ? __eou__ you don ’ t know ? the company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . __eou__ you know what we will get ? __eou__ we will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . and if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . __eou__ what docking station ? __eou__ this is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . the socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . __eou__ another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , i don ’ t need a desktop anymore . a laptop is enough .
what are your plans for this weekend ? __eou__ i'd like to hire a bike . i think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on sunday . __eou__ if the weather's fine . __eou__ i am sure it will be . it's been good so far this weekend . __eou__ i know a good place to hire bikes if you want . __eou__ thanks . that would be really helpful . __eou__ but remember , be careful when you ride a bike . the traffic in beijing can be dangerous .

have you heard that mel gibson was arrested by the police last week ? __eou__ no , not yet . why ? __eou__ for suspicion of driving under influence . __eou__ oh . i am not his fan .

i am confused . how could a golfer need so many clubs ? seems to me , 14 altogether , right __eou__ i should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . __eou__ then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? __eou__ in general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , pw ; woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . __eou__ so many ? __eou__ this is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . it depends on your preferences . __eou__ have you heard of tiger woods ? __eou__ of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name .
where do you live now ? __eou__ i live in haitian district where there are lot of universities . __eou__ which street do you live on ? __eou__ i live at no . 50 xingu street .

nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be . __eou__ true . with the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles . __eou__ i read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from shanghai to ningpo and dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the yangtze river have been reduced by 70 % . __eou__ the pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . i think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . __eou__ but the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat .

i visited the polar aquarium today . __eou__ is it like a zoo of polar animals ? __eou__ almost . there are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , people don't get much chance of seeing them . __eou__ it must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds . __eou__ absolutely . to be frank , i learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . i'm thinking of my kids there one of these days . __eou__ maybe you should let me know about your plan . i want to take my kids there some day . too .
when do children start school in your country ? __eou__ normally at six . before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . __eou__ but thats only in the cities , isnt it ? __eou__ right . in the countryside , things are more complicated . __eou__ can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? __eou__ it depends . in some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . many kids cannot afford to go to school .
let me see . how much should i pay for you ? __eou__ don ’ t think about it ! __eou__ no , this will not do . let me see . __eou__ you pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up . __eou__ good ideas .

look , there are some words on the fish . __eou__ i know that they are auspicious fish . it's quite popular nowadays . __eou__ for god's sake ! it's too bloody . how can people be so cruel ? __eou__ not at all . i think the tattoos are so cool and chic . __eou__ you can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . __eou__ honey , it's not so serious . it's just an animal . __eou__ just an animal ? but it has life too . if you want a tattoo , get one . it's your choice because you want it . but has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? __eou__ ok , i understand , but what else could we do ?
john , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? __eou__ sure . have you checked the weather report ? __eou__ yes . it says it will be sunny all day . no sign of rain at all . __eou__ i'd like some toast and chicken wings . __eou__ okay . please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . __eou__ done . oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . __eou__ that's great . we can also take the dragon kite with us . after the picnic , we can fly it . __eou__ cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . __eou__ okay , it sounds good .
may , is this the hall of ancient china ? __eou__ yes . look at these historical relics here , amazing ! __eou__ why are they all in glass boxes ? __eou__ for protection . some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . __eou__ so there isn't air in the glass boxes ? __eou__ no , there isn't . there is a vacuum in every box . __eou__ i wonder how old these things are . thousands of years ? __eou__ yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . __eou__ hey , look at the tripod . i've seen it on tv . __eou__ it was made 4,000 years ago . it's priceless !
hi , sue . what's up ? __eou__ hey , andrew . how's everything with work ? __eou__ ok , i guess . my boss has been on my back recently . __eou__ really ? what's he been doing ? __eou__ you know , just giving me lots to do . i'm really busy right now . __eou__ are you ? what are you busy with ? __eou__ oh , lots of things . mostly training new people .
my boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . can you guess why ? __eou__ he isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? __eou__ he is , but i didn't mean that . his daughter bought him a tie as a father's day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . __eou__ it must be hard being a father . __eou__ no , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you . __eou__ maybe you'll only feel that way on father's day .
the results of the poll show bill clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . do you find that interesting ? __eou__ well , i think clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . __eou__ that is exactly what the poll shows . although the stating of clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . __eou__ i don't find this surprising . the poll data sound quite right . he is a good president . __eou__ but the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president .
hey , mike . can i ask you something ? __eou__ sure , what's up ? __eou__ i'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . who do you think will win ? __eou__ good question . i have to think about it . __eou__ my husband is betting on france . __eou__ france ? is he crazy ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ well , how can i put this ? france is a terrible team .
i think andy's party will be fun . __eou__ yeah , i think so . oh , by the way , i need to ask you something . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ could i get back the sweater you borrowed ? __eou__ sure . oh , that reminds me . could i borrow your black leather boots ? __eou__ my boots ? er ... sure , ok .
the restaurant across the street hired a new chinese chef , so i ordered some chinese food there for this evening . __eou__ good . i love chinese food . what did you order ? __eou__ something hot and spicy . they look very inviting on the menu . you are going to love them . __eou__ maybe we can find a place to learn some chinese cooking . i hear there's a place in chinatown where you can take some courses . are you interested ? __eou__ i'm not sure . i don't enjoy cooking that much . as long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . __eou__ you are right . but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? it's hot in here . __eou__ actually , i prefer if you didn't . air conditioning makes me sneeze . __eou__ all right . i'm opening the window , though , is that ok ? __eou__ oh , sure . it's very stuffy in here .
hello , tom . where are you heading for ? __eou__ i am going to a movie theater . you know there is a new action film produced by hollywood . a thriller , really . __eou__ another terror film ? there is too much terror and violence in the films . do you like seeing such a picture ? __eou__ i don't really like seeing bloody frames , but i appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
happy birthday , mary ! __eou__ thank you . __eou__ here is a gift for you . i hope you like it . __eou__ what a lovely dog ! how did you know i love this ? __eou__ i had my own ways of finding out . it's a secret . you look so beautiful today . your new shirt goes well with your skirt . __eou__ maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother . __eou__ really ? it looks so nice . __eou__ thank you . please have a cup of tea . __eou__ all right . __eou__ how about some fish ? __eou__ no , thanks . i've had enough . now , mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . after that , you may cut the cake . __eou__ ok , let me make a wish ... do you want a big piece of cake ? __eou__ no , just a small one . next let's sing ' happy birthday ' to mary . __eou__ it is very kind of you . i'm so moved by you .

adam , i'm sorry ! __eou__ but where have you been , alice ? you're over an hour late . __eou__ yes , but i couldn't help it . i was late getting off work for a start , and then i missed the bus . the bus i did catch got caught in a traffic jam . it was one thing after another . __eou__ but why were you getting off work so late ? the office close at six , doesn't it ? __eou__ yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . __eou__ but didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? __eou__ well , no . i thought i'd finish in about five minutes , and i didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . if it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , i wouldn't have been so late . i'm sorry . __eou__ well , you're here . and that's the main thing .
could you tell me the right time , please ? __eou__ well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days . __eou__ you'll have to get it fixed . __eou__ yes , i will .
what is the correct time , please ? __eou__ it's exactly twelve minutes past seven . __eou__ when will the lecture begin ? __eou__ it'll begin at nine o'clock sharp .
well , i must be off now . i have an appointment at six . __eou__ in that case , i won't keep you any longer . drop in any time . __eou__ ok . goodbye . __eou__ see you later .
i just dropped in to say goodbye . __eou__ what time are you leaving ? __eou__ i'll leave at 10 o'clock . __eou__ take care and give my best to you parents . __eou__ thank you , i will . hope to see you again next year .
are you free tomorrow night ? __eou__ yes , i am . __eou__ shall we have dinner together ? __eou__ do you have a special restaurant in mind ? __eou__ yes , i do . i know a place that has excellent food . __eou__ ok . i'll be happy to join you .
what time is it , tom ? __eou__ just a minute . it's ten to nine by my watch . __eou__ is it ? i had no idea it was so late . i must be off now . __eou__ what's the hurry ? __eou__ i must catch the nine-thirty train . __eou__ you've plenty of time yet . the railway station is very close . it won't take more than twenty minutes to get there .
hi , dear , i've got your voice at last . __eou__ hi , darling , i am thinking it is the time of your calling . __eou__ are you ok today ? __eou__ quite good except thinking of you so much . __eou__ so do i . you are a beautiful flower in my mind . __eou__ it's called love is blind , i think .
thank you for coming to see me off . __eou__ not at all . __eou__ if have time , i'll come again . __eou__ you're welcome at any time . __eou__ thank you for your hospitality . i hope i didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay . __eou__ you're most welcome . __eou__ i'm afraid i have to go now . the plane will take off soon . __eou__ call us as soon as you get home .
did you watch tv last night , rose ? __eou__ yeah . i saw a science program . it was quite interesting . __eou__ what was it about ? __eou__ mars . scientists say there might be water on it . __eou__ if so , we may live there someday . __eou__ i hope so . did you know the us successfully sent two robotic explorers to mars last month ? __eou__ sure . i heard about this on the tv . on january 3rd , 2004 , explorer spirit landed near the so-called guser crater . and three weeks later , spirit's twin explorer , opportunity , landed on meridian planum named by scientists . __eou__ yes . both have sent back pictures of the planet . and the latter did a better job .
sometimes i think television is too biased . none of them are completely objective . __eou__ that's unavoidable , but think , how would you keep up to date without television ? __eou__ newspapers or the radio i guess . i just wish tv was more objective . __eou__ look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . __eou__ the internet's a lot worse . __eou__ really ? why ? __eou__ there's no one moderating it . anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . the information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . a lot of people get conned online . __eou__ again , you need to think carefully . if you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them .
who is your favorite nba star ? __eou__ kobe bryant , of course . __eou__ kobe ? i know him , the key guy of the lakers , a heck of a nba player . he is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . __eou__ he is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . __eou__ maybe he is not good at rebounding ? __eou__ indeed , no man can be perfect . he is just so-so in crashing the boards . usually he plays shooting guard . rebounding might not be his strong suit . __eou__ kobe came to beijing during this summer's olympics . did you go to the match between china and usa ? __eou__ who wouldn't ! my friend lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . __eou__ well then , what are your spoils ? __eou__ well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs .
hmm , what should i wear today ? __eou__ come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . there are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . __eou__ well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? __eou__ i have and i can prove that is 100 % true for you . __eou__ loving to look beautiful is women's nature . in fact , i am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . __eou__ no kidding ! again ? ! you just went shopping yesterday . you really are a shopaholic . __eou__ well , i need to change the shoes i bought from nasi . they are too small . i want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . __eou__ ok . do you have the receipt with you ? i think they will ask you to show them the receipt first .
how do you like this waltz ? __eou__ it's very nice . i like it very much . __eou__ well , then , may i invite you for the first dance ? __eou__ my pleasure . but i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer , and i suppose you dance often . __eou__ me ? oh , no . in fact , i only took up dancing quite recently . __eou__ oh , really ? but you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ i'm glad you say so . you dance beautifully too . it's lucky that i got you as a partner . __eou__ thank you for your compliments . it's just you are a good leader . do you like the foxtrot and tango ? __eou__ yes . and what dances do you like best ? __eou__ disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . but i don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . __eou__ oh , well , the music has stopped . thank you for the dance . __eou__ my pleasure .
i do feel like a trip to florida on such a gloomy day in new york , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of florida . __eou__ that's a great idea . it's the best season for tourists in florida . you can also get a good sun-tan there . __eou__ but if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . __eou__ you can put on your shades . and remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . you may even wind up with skin cancer . __eou__ i see . overdoing it will do more harm than good . __eou__ you said it .
would you like a cigarette ? __eou__ no , thanks . i've decided to give up smoking . __eou__ really ? why ? __eou__ well , it's just that i think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . __eou__ i see . you mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? __eou__ that's right . you should give it up , too . it's bad for your health . __eou__ stop talking like my mother . that's what she keeps saying . __eou__ but it's true . it's a nasty habit . i can't think why i ever started . anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! __eou__ what do you mean ? what are you talking about ? __eou__ i mean you couldn't give it up ! __eou__ who ? me ? could't give up smoking ? nonsense ! of course i could ! i know i could ! __eou__ how do you know ? __eou__ because i've already proved it . smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . i've done it hundreds of times !
you went out on a date last night , didn't you ? __eou__ yes , i did , but linda stood me up . she didn't keep the date for the first time . __eou__ how come ? __eou__ i don't know . __eou__ why don't you phone her for a date again ? __eou__ i did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . i think she is going to walk out on me . __eou__ don't jump to conclusions . look at the bright side , try to make another date again . __eou__ i will . thanks for your advice .
what are you using for bait today ? __eou__ we are fishing with worms . the fish seem to like them . __eou__ is that so ? we're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . __eou__ looks like a lucky day for everyone .
mary and tom are breaking up . __eou__ it's unbelievable ! they are only married for one month . then who is at fault ? __eou__ mary said she couldn't put up with tom , for he fell in love with another woman . __eou__ do you think they'll become reconciled ? __eou__ no , i don't think so . she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . __eou__ what a shame ! their marriage is really a mistake .
do you know who ammo hung is ? __eou__ of course . he is now 50 years old . and he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . he has also become an independent producer and director . __eou__ you know only one aspect of him . do you know what he would do in the kitchen ? __eou__ i have no idea . tell me . __eou__ in the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show . __eou__ what does he do there ? __eou__ imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . and his culinary motto is ' enjoy the moment . ' if you want to know hey theycook , visit www.studioclassroom.com.tw for the recipe .
excuse me miao li . could you tell me who jackie chan is ? __eou__ certainly . jackie chan is a very famous movie star in hong kong . his chinese name is cheng long . __eou__ ha , i know cheng long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . and at that time he was promoted as the new bruce lee . but i'm not familiar with his english name . __eou__ ok . then tell me what else you know . __eou__ some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . do you know how jackie chan measures his worth ? __eou__ he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . by the way , can you count the breaks ? __eou__ sure . his skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . as he said ' everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' __eou__ indeed you know much about him . __eou__ this is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world .
look at this , a brief introduction of hollywood . __eou__ hackneyed theme ! __eou__ what ? how much do you know hollywood ? __eou__ nearly everything . __eou__ you are full of boasts . i can examine you by question and answer . what is hollywood ? where is it ? what is the function of it ? __eou__ too easy questions . listen carefully . hollywood is the movie capital of the world.it is located in southern california . many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . __eou__ not bad . what kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s __eou__ gangster movies . movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . __eou__ mm . what came after that ? __eou__ after all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . then came musicals . __eou__ pretty good . please continue . __eou__ right . by the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . there was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . __eou__ the western films about america's cowboys , indians and early settlers . __eou__ come on . __eou__ since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . __eou__ any more ? __eou__ of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . these are especially popular among children .
now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . __eou__ yeah . __eou__ then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . __eou__ well , if that's the case , i don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . i can only do what i know , and live how i've lived all my life , because i'm a fairly stubborn person . __eou__ it seems to me that now you're famous . you've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . __eou__ i don't go to parties . the parties i go to are the barbecues i have in my house . being seen in the right places is something that i don't believe in . i don't believe in going to events just for the sake i of being seen . __eou__ then fans don't see you much in public places . __eou__ yes . i have a very low-key life ; i have a great life . i love what i do and i love how i spend my time , which isn't in a public place . __eou__ a lot of people compare you to julia roberts . i wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' well , they've got something i could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' __eou__ i've never had one person that i'd idolized . the comparisons to jul-ia roberts are incredibly flattering . i don't really know who i would compare myself to . i'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . a little bit of everything , really . i haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and i've definitely found my weaknesses .
it seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . __eou__ we actually met at a dance party . he fell for me . __eou__ he must be all over you the first time he saw you . __eou__ he said that i put all other girls in the shade . __eou__ that means he was head over heels in love with you . __eou__ well , he indeed likes me . __eou__ but i think he can't hold a candle to you . i don't think he has ever popped the question . __eou__ no , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel .
how did you first meet jack each other ? __eou__ that is a heavy raining afternoon . i was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . it's getting dark . __eou__ and then ? __eou__ i was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' where is your home ? ' __eou__ then he sent you to your home ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ it's a romantic meeting . i can say that a hero saves a beauty . __eou__ he joked later that i was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . __eou__ he is so humorous .
i'll help you , lucy . look at what i've got here . in this small bottle , there's a magic love potion . __eou__ a magic love potion ? __eou__ yes . if you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . __eou__ it can't be true . __eou__ take my word for it . __eou__ so what am i going to do ? __eou__ just come to our house and stay over . you'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' good morning ! ' __eou__ that sounds like a blue rose ! my sitting by his bed ? __eou__ don't be so shy , lucy .
i went to super junior's concert last night . it was fantastic . __eou__ really ? their songs are very popular all round asia now . i am also a big fan of theirs . __eou__ yes , their new album just came out last week . it is number one on the billboard . __eou__ i really love their dancing . they are all excellent dancers . __eou__ the lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . can you sing ? __eou__ sure . i think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . __eou__ let's go buy their new album . want to come with me ? __eou__ why not ?
herman , why are you so excited ? __eou__ i have met a beautiful girl . __eou__ have you fallen in love ? __eou__ yes . at first sight . __eou__ can you describe the situation at that time ? __eou__ at that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold . __eou__ what's her outlook ? __eou__ she was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . her complexion was clear and golden .
did you watch the premiership last night ? __eou__ yes , i watched united play chelsea . what a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . well , it was not like a normal english league match . __eou__ no , it wasn't . rather , it looked like a bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . english league teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . it seems to me english soccer players are very gentlemanly . as diego maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . __eou__ haha . that's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in english league matches than those on the continent . and the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . such games are quite pleasing to the eye . __eou__ which team do you back then ? __eou__ i'm a firm united supporter . i like their playing style . the reds always have several excellent wing-backs , like riggs , peckham and gary neville . they often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . __eou__ but the reds keep a weak midfield . i think juventas of italian series a have always maintained a very formidable midfield . it is the main source of its strength .
dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? i read the newspaper this morning . i know there is an art exhibition in taipei modern art museum . __eou__ sure . i am free tomorrow . it sounds interesting to me . can we buy the ticket online ? __eou__ i don't think so . i think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . __eou__ i guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . __eou__ look at the ticket booth in the center . there seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . __eou__ yeah . we are lucky . let's go buy the tickets first . we can have breakfast later . i am so hungry . __eou__ good idea . __eou__ ( after the breakfast ) which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? __eou__ i have no idea . let me take a closer look at my museum map __eou__ sure , take your time . we have a whole day . __eou__ it's on the 2nd floor . we are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient greece . __eou__ look at the museum guide.it says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . let's rent an audio guide .
which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this world cup ? __eou__ i wish it could be germany . but it seems they are not in a very good conditions . __eou__ no , they aren't . they had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . just think , group a consists of austria , china , and saudi arabia , all of which are minnows . __eou__ it seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . oh . my goodness ! i'm afraid the team is under a spell . __eou__ well , at least the germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . they recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against austria . and they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . i think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . __eou__ i agree . eeven though german attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . __eou__ that's why i still have very high hopes for the team . now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the germans will probably make it through to the finals . __eou__ yes . they have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters .
what do you think of smoking ? __eou__ it's harmful . not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ what in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ but that'll affect the national economy . __eou__ that's right.but i don't think there are better ways . __eou__ how about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ maybe it can take effect .
are you a smoker ? __eou__ yes , i'm afraid i am . my husband is a smoker too . __eou__ would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ no , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day . __eou__ when did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ i had my first cigarette when i was seventeen . __eou__ might i ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ yes , twice .
then i must go-you have said it yourself . __eou__ no , you must stay ! i swear it , and the oath shall be kept . __eou__ i tell you i must go ! __eou__ where ? __eou__ i have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now . __eou__ i ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . __eou__ i'll never again come to your side ; i am turn away now and can't return .
tomorrow is sunday . let's go out and get some fresh air . __eou__ i know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near taipei . are you interested in going there ? __eou__ why not ? i love animals and i love nature . __eou__ you can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . __eou__ sounds very interesting . i can't wait to go there . __eou__ wow ! it is huge and you can do many activities here . __eou__ that is true . some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . __eou__ i never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . __eou__ well , now you know . let's go to the lake over there . some people are fishing over there . i haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , i really want to try . __eou__ i think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . __eou__ yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . who do you think will catch a big fish first ? __eou__ of course . i will . __eou__ wait and see . i want to try horseback riding after fishing . it looks very exciting and fun . __eou__ it is . however , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . __eou__ no problem . it is always worth trying something new once in your life time .
i have a sweet tooth . i can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . __eou__ a new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . they have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . __eou__ that sounds really attractive . let's go to that candy shop now . __eou__ are you serious ? it is always crowded with many people . __eou__ why not ? i would like to buy some candies . since there are so many people , i think they must have delicious candy . __eou__ look at the candy bar over there . it is so colorful and tasty . __eou__ they have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . they are in different colors and flavors . __eou__ i want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . __eou__ me too . i finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . __eou__ to be honest , i care only about whether i can have some delicious candy eat . i couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . __eou__ you are a candy terminator . be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . __eou__ that is true . speaking of cavities , i am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . __eou__ you really can't live without candy .
did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? the person who wrote that must be crazy . __eou__ i don't think so . i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . __eou__ maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes would do no good . __eou__ no.you can't suddenly make smoking illegal . but the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters .
i've brought a little dog for alice , girls usually like looking after pets . __eou__ thank you , but alice is only a visitor here . i don't know if she'll keep it . __eou__ to tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . i want to ask alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . __eou__ really ?
may i ask what the name is the girl ? __eou__ which one ? __eou__ the tallest one . __eou__ she is miao li . she's come here to see her brother . __eou__ oh , it's so . she looks very lovely . could you give me some else information on her ? __eou__ ok . she's a costume designer and works in a garment mill . __eou__ how do you think about her ? __eou__ she looks very beautiful . she is a nice girl . __eou__ i'm wondering if she has boyfriend . __eou__ no , she hasn't . __eou__ great ! thank you very much .
you look a bit dull today . what's up ? __eou__ well , my mum lost her job yesterday . __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that . well , i heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . __eou__ the supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . __eou__ yeah , it's true . what is she going to do ? __eou__ well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . __eou__ that's not bad . it could be a short-term alternative . your mum can look for another one when the market improves . things will work out eventually . __eou__ thank you . i just hope she won't feel pressed .
do you know his sister ? __eou__ her name is laura , isn't it ? __eou__ that's right . __eou__ how old is she ? __eou__ um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , i can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . tthat's it . __eou__ what does she look like ? __eou__ well ... __eou__ pretty , is she ? __eou__ yes ... quite pretty .
can you lend me fifty bucks ? __eou__ what ? again ? why do you keep running out of money ? __eou__ i guess i don't earn enough . __eou__ no , i think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . __eou__ that's my business , not yours . __eou__ true enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . i don't know where you're wasting your money but i think you need to take a look at what's really important . __eou__ so how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? __eou__ i don't just survive . i put money away as well . i know when i get paid where most of the cash will go , and i stick to my plan . if i follow a budget i don't have any nasty surprises . __eou__ i'm not disciplined enough i guess . __eou__ in a few months i'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . i think you need to reevaluate your spending habits .
hey , jeff , where's your stereo ? __eou__ i needed some money , so i hocked it last week . __eou__ you must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . __eou__ i had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . then last wednesday i received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . i hit the ceiling when i saw that . __eou__ it sounds like you weren't expecting that . __eou__ i'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . he forgot to mention that she happened to be in new york at the time 3000 miles away . __eou__ well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , i can loan you some . __eou__ thanks , but tomorrow's payday i can make until then . thanks any-way .
what colour is her hair ? __eou__ oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... __eou__ what , curly ? __eou__ no , not at all . very straight . her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . __eou__ does she wear glasses ? __eou__ no ... no . i think you're thinking of someone else . __eou__ no . i'm sure i know her . __eou__ er ... what else can i tell you ? er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . __eou__ ah ... no , i can't place her .
that one looks pretty big . are you going to keep it ? __eou__ of course . i always keep what i catch . __eou__ not me . i like to throw back what i catch . __eou__ if it's within the legal limit , i prefer to keep it .
my daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . she says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . __eou__ it seems quite normal to me . it is pretty much what i want to do . __eou__ but what about settling down to start a family ? doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? __eou__ it is different now . the world is becoming colorful . some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . we all want to wait for the right moment . __eou__ what time is the right moment ? __eou__ let the universe find us instead of forcing love . we prefer natural love . the most important thing is to be happy . love will find us later . that is what we say .
hey , buddy . are the fish biting today ? __eou__ they sure are . they are practically jumping in the boat . __eou__ is that so ? well , what kind of bait are you using ? __eou__ we're catching most of our fish with lures . __eou__ lures ? we're using live bait over here . __eou__ what kind of live bait are you using ? worms or minnows ? __eou__ we're using worms . __eou__ are you having any luck with the worms ? __eou__ no , we haven't even gotten a nibble today . __eou__ that's too bad . why don't you try using lures instead ? __eou__ i would , but i don't have any in my tackle box . __eou__ that's too bad . well , where are you fishing ? __eou__ i'm just fishing from the shore . how about you ? __eou__ we went out in our boat . i have a favorite fishing hole out there . __eou__ sweet.can you tell me where it is ? __eou__ oh no , i can't tell you . it's a secret . say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ? __eou__ do you think that's a good spot ? __eou__ sure , i used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time . __eou__ thanks . i think i'll go check that out now . __eou__ good luck . i hope you each some fish .
i don't know why people are just mad about david peckham . is there really anything so fascinating with him ? __eou__ he appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__ certainly not . what really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.however , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . __eou__ in the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . after all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__ yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . as a man of medium height in the west , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . __eou__ and he is english ! he makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical british accent .
are you still busy today ? __eou__ it seems to be . how about you today ? __eou__ fine , honey . rome couldn't be built with in one day . __eou__ ok , i'll find the time to relax soon . __eou__ take care , honey . i am always expecting you .
millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . __eou__ yes.it ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . __eou__ it's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . __eou__ which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? __eou__ well , for example , the wall street journal is very , very good . even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . __eou__ i like to read fortune . __eou__ good . fortune is usually ahead of the curve.and business week is very solid , too . __eou__ where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? i hope it's not just from press releases . __eou__ a good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . __eou__ but sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . __eou__ you are right about that .
what's your favorite hobby ? __eou__ i'd like reading books best . __eou__ what kinds of books do you like to read ? __eou__ literature and economy . __eou__ by the way , would you like to see movies ? __eou__ that's ok . __eou__ what do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ i like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes . __eou__ i just like to sleep like a lazy cat . __eou__ that's a bad habit .
they are a nice middle-aged couple , just like us . __eou__ if they are just like us , they are not middle-aged . __eou__ of course they are . __eou__ middle-aged means in the middle , ethel , middle of life . people don't live to a hundred and fifty . __eou__ oh , we are the part on the edge of middle . that's all . __eou__ oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . you're old , and i'm aging . __eou__ oh , fool ! you're nearly seventy and i'm in the low sixties . would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ? __eou__ i can if you like .
hello , mr . black , i'm calling to say goodbye . __eou__ you're leaving so soon ? i wish you stayed a little longer . __eou__ i wish i could stay a little longer , but a lot of things to do back home . __eou__ have you got the ticket ? __eou__ yes , i did . __eou__ what time are you going ? __eou__ at 11:00 o'clock . __eou__ i'll pick you up by nine o'clock and take you straight to the airport . __eou__ no , i'll go by myself , thanks . __eou__ ok , goodbye .

i often go to a place of leisure . __eou__ really ? __eou__ i very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine . __eou__ sounds great . __eou__ the coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there . __eou__ how nice . __eou__ i may take you there some day . __eou__ good .

have you heard that new song by the beastie boys ? __eou__ why do you listen to rap ? __eou__ it's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much . __eou__ heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.you can dance to heavy metal . __eou__ hey , you can dance to rap music ! __eou__ i can't dance to it . and i know you can't either . because i've seen you try .

' __eou__ that's right . his voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the spanish caribbean where he grew up . he has fan clubs across the world , from america to russia , from england to taiwan , from norway to australia .

okay , show me your card hand . here's mine . i have three kings and a pair of aces . __eou__ how did you get that ? no need to show you my hand , i lose.this is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . __eou__ thanks again for buying the tickets . that was the most exciting live concert i've ever seen . that silver electric guitar was really cool . __eou__ they're quite popular now . wasn't her voice good ? __eou__ that , my heart will go on . it warms my heart . you know , janetjackson , shanna twain and celine dion are so very different . __eou__ janet jackson is more pop music.shania sings country music . celine just seems to hit all the right notes . __eou__ have you heard maria carey ? __eou__ yes , l have two of her cds , l'ii lend them to you if you like . __eou__ excellent . you can borrow my janet jackson's cd . it's her new one . __eou__ i hope you have a good stereo . __eou__ why ? __eou__ because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect .
what was the last movie you saw ? __eou__ a korean film called friends , starring sang dong-gun . __eou__ really ? i've seen that movie , too . __eou__ how did you like the movie ? __eou__ i thought it was pretty good . __eou__ really ? i can't say i agree . __eou__ you're kidding . the story and acting were outstanding . __eou__ i guess i expected too much from the movie , so i was a bit disappointed . __eou__ i guess it could happen .
hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ? __eou__ sounds good . what should we see ? __eou__ how about that european movie ? __eou__ you mean the one starring john travolta ? __eou__ yeah , that's the one i've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding . __eou__ sounds like an interesting film . let's meet at five o'clock on saturday . __eou__ okay , see you then .
wasn't that a great flick ? i was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . __eou__ i would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill hollywood thriller . __eou__ well , i'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards . __eou__ special effects ? baloney ! that movie was made on a shoestring budget . they've been using trick photography like that for years __eou__ okay . but you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . __eou__ you should read the book . the original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . __eou__ oh , really ? how does the book end ? __eou__ read it yourself and find out !
i know you are a good dancer . what dances do you like ? __eou__ i like the old styles of dance . such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . they're all graceful . __eou__ why do you like old styles of dance ? __eou__ why not ? do you think i should like modern dance ? __eou__ i think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll . __eou__ oh , sorry . i don't like them . why not ask lily . she likes modern dance . __eou__ ok , i will.thank you .
people of different races are fit for quite different sports . for instance , asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . they seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . __eou__ and a typical example has been the chinese athletes at the beijing olympics , right ? __eou__ yes , in all these four sports . the chinese olympic dream teams led the way . they swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . __eou__ then what are the westerners fit for ? __eou__ i think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . __eou__ where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? __eou__ it's common sense that african athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . __eou__ i got you . their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . they are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes .
how is night life in beijing ? __eou__ very interesting ! __eou__ what do you suggest then ? __eou__ how about going to dance ? there is a very good nightclub nearby . __eou__ that's a great idea . let's go ... oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful . __eou__ i'm glad you like it.the band is called " four and one " . they are especially good at playing rock and roll . __eou__ that's great ! i love to dance to fast music . __eou__ then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ? __eou__ yes , disco dancing is my favorite.it ' s great fun and good exercise as well . __eou__ ok . let's disco . __eou__ now the band is playing a slow dance . __eou__ that's a waltz . would you like to try it ? __eou__ sorry , i think i'il sit out the next dance . __eou__ all right . let me get you something to drink .
may i invite you for a dance ? __eou__ with pleasure . __eou__ you dance well . do you breakdance ? __eou__ me , what brought that on ? __eou__ there's a story about breakdancing in the paper . __eou__ what does it say ? __eou__ according to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . __eou__ like disco ? __eou__ well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . __eou__ and disco a kind of nightclub . __eou__ right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... __eou__ so ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.and breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . __eou__ you are witty .
how do you like this waltz ? __eou__ it's very nice , i like it very much . __eou__ well , then , may i invite you for the first dance ? __eou__ my pleasure . but i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer , and i suppose you dance often . __eou__ me ? oh , no . in fact , i took up dancing quite recently . __eou__ oh , really ? but you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . __eou__ i'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . it's lucky that i got a partner . __eou__ thank you for your compliments.it ' s just that you are a good leader . do you like the fox-trot and tango ? __eou__ yes . and what dances do you do best ? __eou__ disco is my favorite . i like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . but i don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . __eou__ oh , well , the music has stopped . thank you for the dance . __eou__ my pleasure . let's go and have a drink . __eou__ fine .
what's your favorite sport ? __eou__ it's hard to say . perhaps swimming is my favorite . i like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . in the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . currently , i go to the pool twice every week . __eou__ is the entrance charge expensive ? __eou__ well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . what a costly sport ! that is why i have to refrain from even thinking about it . and i find jogging a very agreeable substitute . __eou__ haha , jogging ? perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? __eou__ you know what ? you won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . it is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . this leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . sometimes , i even come up with a verse or two . __eou__ you are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone .
it's rather cold , isn't it ? __eou__ oh , yes , it is . __eou__ shall i light the stove ? __eou__ that's a good idea . __eou__ well , what's the climate like in your country ? __eou__ it's mild , but it's not always pleasant . __eou__ which season do you like best ? __eou__ i like spring . the days are long and the night are short . the flowers are in bloom.we go on picnics .
how nice it is here . __eou__ you can say that again.the sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.it ' s so lovely . __eou__ i've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year . __eou__ that's correct . we have four seasons of spring .
the weather in beijing is just beautiful ! __eou__ autumn is the best season in beijing , you know . __eou__ yes , i can see . the summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . __eou__ what is the weather like in washington at this time of this year ? __eou__ autumn is also very nice in washington . __eou__ is it very cold in winter there ? __eou__ no , it isn't . but sometimes it snows a lot in winter . __eou__ does it rain a lot in summer there ? __eou__ oh yes ! sometimes it rains very heavily.how about here in beijing ? __eou__ there's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn . __eou__ i feel it's rather dry here . __eou__ that's true . many people from the south don't like the weather here . __eou__ are you from the south ? __eou__ no , i'm from the north . i was born in beijing , actually . __eou__ i see.so this is your hometown ?
i really like the record you lent me the other day . __eou__ i'm glad you like it . __eou__ and thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . __eou__ not at all . __eou__ i'm most grateful . everyone in our class enjoyed it . __eou__ i'm glad . __eou__ would you mind my keeping it for another week ?
i'd better be going . __eou__ so soon ? why don't you stay a little longer ? __eou__ i wish i could , but it's already late . __eou__ oh , it's a pity that you have to leave . __eou__ thank you for a wonderful meal . __eou__ i'm glad you enjoyed it .
if you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . __eou__ yes . the german engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the occident within a few years and even spread to japan and china . __eou__ looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . to pull the t-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . __eou__ small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . __eou__ your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . it has a feeling of surfing . you need not let other people teach you . your fear will disappear quickly .
how'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? __eou__ i'm not sure . i promised to help my sister move saturday . __eou__ how about sunday , then ? we could start in the morning . __eou__ i might be able to do that . but i don't think i can do it well . __eou__ don't worry . it is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . just to finish it is considered a victory for most . __eou__ ok . i'll talk to you later .
i'm afraid i've got to go . i have another appointment at five . __eou__ do you ? by the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ? __eou__ no problem . __eou__ thank you . come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . i'll have the pictures ready by then . __eou__ i will .
it seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . that is what a good salesman needs . good luck . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ i guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye . __eou__ yes , goodbye and keep in touch .
how do you usually sell your products now ? __eou__ i'm doing business through internet now . __eou__ oh , really ? is it a good way ? __eou__ yes , very good . __eou__ what advantages does it have ? __eou__ it is very convenient . you know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time . __eou__ yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . __eou__ also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of internet , which is very cheap . __eou__ yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . but does it have any disadvantages ? __eou__ to be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways . __eou__ you mean there may be credit problems ? __eou__ yes , but if you choose some good b2b websites , such problems can be avoided . __eou__ will you give some suggestion ? __eou__ of course , such as the alabama , which is a famous website . __eou__ thanks . maybe i will do business through internet in the future .
how do you shoot pool ? __eou__ you have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . __eou__ and ? __eou__ you hit the white ball with your cue . the white ball hits the colored balls . and you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . __eou__ how do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? __eou__ at the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . __eou__ can i get the black ball in ? __eou__ the black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . __eou__ let's go and try now !
hi . have you got a personal computer ? __eou__ certainly . what's the matter ? __eou__ i wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . __eou__ sure . i often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . __eou__ great ! it's just like viewless stores . but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? __eou__ that's simple . just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place . __eou__ is the service charged ? __eou__ no . it's free . __eou__ really . i'll get a computer at once .
today more and more families have personal computers . people have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world . __eou__ right . with the establishment of internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web . __eou__ one of the common uses of pc is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores . __eou__ can you tell me how it is done ? __eou__ if a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . and then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . the service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge . __eou__ i see . so great .
i'm better now . want to play again ? __eou__ i'll let you break the balls this time . __eou__ let's get all the balls out of the pockets . __eou__ ok . how much do you want to bet on this game ? __eou__ you are crazy . gambling is against my principles .
what are you doing for christmas this year ? __eou__ all my relatives are getting together at my house . __eou__ that's great . m ost of my family is coming home too . __eou__ who can't make it in your family ? __eou__ my sister.she is going to her in-law's house this year . __eou__ that's too bad . so , what did you ask for christmas this year ? __eou__ i asked santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games . __eou__ i want some computer games also . i gave my parents a really long christmas list . __eou__ i hope that i get what i asked for . __eou__ so what does your family do on christmas day ? __eou__ we wake up early and go to church.then we come back home and open our gifts together . how about you ? __eou__ our family is a little different . we go to church on christmas eve instead .
( before christmas party ) are you ready for the christmas party tonight __eou__ almost . i have to get dressed . it's a formal party and i have special party make up ! __eou__ use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine ! __eou__ great ! uh , remember that there's a gift exchange , too . we all have to bring a gift . __eou__ i've already got mine . __eou__ ( at the party ) it's christmas eve ! time to open presents ! __eou__ here ! open mine first . __eou__ wow ! it's just what i wanted ! __eou__ hey ! why don't i have any presents !
did you get a nice tree ? __eou__ sure did . it's a beauty . where do you want it ? __eou__ let's put it over there . __eou__ let's go to work . we want to have the tree ready to light up by evening . __eou__ let's string the lights first.then we won't have to mess up the decorations . __eou__ hand me some globes and paper flowers , i'll put them on these top branches . __eou__ there , ... we're about done . __eou__ let's switch the lights on . __eou__ ok . here goes . __eou__ well , i guess we're all set for another merry christmas .
we ’ re going to the dragon boat festival tomorrow . feel like coming along ? __eou__ sure . i ’ ve never seen a dragon boat race . __eou__ really ? i think you ’ ll love it . __eou__ as long as i don ’ t have to row .
these days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . he plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . the funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . i wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . __eou__ don't worry . he'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . my son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . he's really absorbed by the discussions . __eou__ that's exactly like my wife . she spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . __eou__ i guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .
hey , tom . you look tired . are you all right ? __eou__ i didn't sleep much last night . __eou__ how come ? __eou__ you know miao li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . he has turned his computer into an electronic playground . he plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . every night he keeps me up . __eou__ don't you like games __eou__ i usually get a lot of information on the computer and use e-mail to send messages to my friends . __eou__ me too . recently , i've made many friends on the net . every day i talk to them and share many interesting things with them . __eou__ don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ? __eou__ i'm afraid not . to me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . __eou__ yes .
hi ! i'm happy you could make it . __eou__ well , i've been looking forward to seeing you . __eou__ what can i get you ? __eou__ i'd love a gin and tonic .
good evening , i'm so happy you could come . __eou__ thank you for inviting me . __eou__ what would you like to drink ? __eou__ a glass of white wine would be fine , thank you .
come in . it's nice to see you again . __eou__ it's nice to be here . __eou__ would you care for a drink ? __eou__ just a club soda for me , please .
we are doing ' secret santa ' at the office again this year . __eou__ whose name did you pick ? __eou__ i got jacob . any ideas what to get him ? __eou__ booze ! __eou__ yeah , you ’ re right . can ’ t go wrong with that .
do you know what the bbs is ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ tell me then . __eou__ bbs means bulletin board service . __eou__ oh , i see , but what's it used for ? __eou__ a lot of things ! __eou__ tell me in details . __eou__ okay . bbs , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . __eou__ oh , that's great . i want to try later . __eou__ why not ?
i need your help , bob . __eou__ what's the matter ? __eou__ i'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . __eou__ just relax . that's because you're new to chat . let me take a look . __eou__ a / s / l , igp , h & k , and zzz . what the hell do they mean ? __eou__ zzz means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , a / s / l is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . it's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' __eou__ interesting . then what does h & k refer to ? the city of hong kong ? __eou__ wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . __eou__ really ? what kind ? a girl left this word to me , and i thought she was in hong kong . __eou__ ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . h & k actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__ hug and kiss ? ! how is it possible ? oh , it's really bad to miun - verstand her meaning . __eou__ yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize .
did you listen to the weather forecast ? __eou__ no . why ? __eou__ there's a typhoon coming . __eou__ no way ! __eou__ yep , it should be here by tomorrow night .
what are you doing ? __eou__ i'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time , i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . __eou__ you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? __eou__ i guess you could say that . what kind of games do you like ? __eou__ i guess the games i like the most are the ones that i'm good at ! __eou__ doesn't everyone ? which games are those ? __eou__ well , i like to play darts . whenever i go to a bar , i usually play for a few hours . __eou__ did you play a lot of games when you were little ? __eou__ my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . we used to have family tournaments every weekend . __eou__ do you still like playing those games ? __eou__ not at all . i never really did , to be honest . what about you ? did your family used to play games together ? __eou__ everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . __eou__ some of my friends play cards on the internet . have you ever tried that ? __eou__ no , i prefer to play with people i know . __eou__ how about mah-jong ? __eou__ it's a popular game with some people , but i've never played it . __eou__ i thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__ i hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same !
what did you do last night ? __eou__ i just stayed at home and watched tv . __eou__ did you watch the barcelona versus madrid game ? __eou__ yes , it was a very evenly matched game . __eou__ what were the results of the game ? __eou__ it ended in a tie . __eou__ what was the actual score ? __eou__ it was three all . __eou__ really ? i thought barcelona was going to win . they are a much better team than madrid . __eou__ if barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . __eou__ that explains it . __eou__ how many more games are left this season ? __eou__ that was the last game before the playoffs . __eou__ when do the playoffs start ? __eou__ in a few weeks . are you planning on watching them ? __eou__ of course ! i really love watching football games on tv . __eou__ me , too ! do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? i'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . __eou__ sure , that would be great . __eou__ ok , it's a date then !
did you watch the oscars on sunday night ? __eou__ no , but i heard about that angelina jolie and brad pitt didn't attend . __eou__ yes , that was surprising . i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . __eou__ they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood . __eou__ they're also one of the richest couples . they have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want . __eou__ i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars . __eou__ did either one of them win an oscar this year ? __eou__ i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but i don't think he won anything . __eou__ tom cruise may be handsome , but i think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? __eou__ yes , his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous . __eou__ i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__ people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i don't know why they have to make it so complicated . __eou__ i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . __eou__ that's true . i guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . __eou__ thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__ being famous , i can do without , but i wouldn't mind being rich .
what happened ? why didn't he win ? __eou__ didn't you hear ? he was disqualified . __eou__ how did that happen ? he's so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! __eou__ if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . __eou__ what ? what kind of drugs was he using ? __eou__ he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . __eou__ i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__ they are . the only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__ that's so disappointing . i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__ i don't think it's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__ regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . __eou__ i agree . hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . __eou__ let's hope so .
guess what ! i know something you don't know ! __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ how many planets are there in the solar system ? __eou__ that's easy . everyone knows that there are nine . __eou__ not anymore ! can you believe it ? they've decided that pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__ nice try . i wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__ i'm dead serious . they've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__ that sounds crazy . but they can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__ yes , they can . if you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__ i suppose you're right . they also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__ we actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . __eou__ do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? __eou__ i suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . __eou__ do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? __eou__ i hope not . i think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the earth . __eou__ you're so old-fashioned . that's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__ point taken . hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society .
what date is it today ? __eou__ today is december 23,2002 . __eou__ oh , the day after tomorrow is christmas . __eou__ merry christmas to you !
don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? __eou__ i don't think so . __eou__ how about going to a concert ? __eou__ that suits me fine .
hi , long time no see . how have you been ? __eou__ oh , i've been fine , but i'm having some trouble with my son . __eou__ tell me all about it . __eou__ oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . he locks himself in his room and i think he's running around with the wrong crowd . __eou__ oh , i see . what makes you think that ? __eou__ well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . and one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . __eou__ really ? what happened ? __eou__ he told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . __eou__ i see what you mean . i understand why you're concerned . have you tried talking to your son about it ? __eou__ i haven't yet . i just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . __eou__ you may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . __eou__ you're right . i should talk to him . sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . thanks . it helps to get it off my chest . you're always so easy to talk to . __eou__ i don't know about that , but my door is always open . stop by anytime .
hey , what's up ? __eou__ oh , nothing . __eou__ what were you writing ? __eou__ ( laugh ) all right . you caught me in the act . i finally worked up the nerve to ask diana out . i was just writing a note to put on her desk . __eou__ you mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? you big chicken ! __eou__ i admit it . i'm a wuss . i just can't do it in person . __eou__ but , you work with her everyday . __eou__ that's different . when i'm working , i'm in a different frame of mind . but , when i even think about asking her out , i get tongue-tied . at least in a note , i can get the words out without turning beet red . __eou__ you've dated a lot . what's so different about diana ? __eou__ well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . she's so upbeat and sweet . who doesn't like her ? oh , i don't know . all i do know is that i think we have great chemistry together . but , what if i'm wrong . maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . oh ... forget it . this was a bad idea . __eou__ well , i guess you don't want this note , then . __eou__ what note ? __eou__ i was looking for you to deliver this note from diana . she wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . __eou__ you're kidding ! i can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . __eou__ sorry . what can i say ? now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__ yeah , i want the note . __eou__ have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__ thanks . i plan on it .
hello . may i speak to mary , please ? __eou__ speaking . who's calling , please ? __eou__ hi , mary . this is tom . __eou__ oh , hi , tom . how've you been ? __eou__ just fine . i say . aren't you busy tomorrow evening ? __eou__ let me see . uh-huh ... no , i guess i'll be free . __eou__ well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? __eou__ sounds like a good idea . __eou__ okay . i'll pick you up at 6:00 . __eou__ thank you for inviting me . see you then . bye , tom .
does your girl friend like swimming ? __eou__ yes , she does . she is good at backstroke and free style . __eou__ then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke . __eou__ but she wants to learn the butterfly stroke __eou__ really ? then just ask her to follow me . __eou__ i heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ? __eou__ yes . but i still have some difficulties it breathing . __eou__ say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer . __eou__ to tell you the truth , i have never thought of being a swimmer . i swim just for fun . __eou__ that's good .
so , are you enjoying the performance so far ? __eou__ well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . what do you think ? __eou__ i think you're being a little critical . the actor in the lead role is fantastic . i suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . __eou__ do you know anyone in the play ? __eou__ actually , the woman playing ophelia is a past classmate of mine . __eou__ really ? is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__ that's only part of it . i absolutely adore this director . every play he works on turns out great . __eou__ so you've seen other plays that he's directed ? __eou__ quite a few actually . by the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . my friend has invited us . do you want to go ? __eou__ sure , i'd love to meet the cast ! have you ever been in a play ? __eou__ i've never had a part in a play before , but i used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ? __eou__ i once helped out with costumes , but i didn't enjoy it very much . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . __eou__ that sounds kind of boring . oh , look . they're dimming the lights . i think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play .
get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . what a life ! i've had enough of it . __eou__ cool down , man . everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . but life isn't really all that . you should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__ what should i do then ? __eou__ i recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . it may offer you many benefits . first , it's good for your health . i'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . while lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . you might as well sleep out for a longer hour . __eou__ i know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . after all , it's a sport . but do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__ well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like beijing . i think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . bicycling home after work can help release your stress . life in the offices is miserable . you just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? enjoy the speed on the road . just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . how great !
could you come and spend the weekend with us ? __eou__ oh , i'm afraid i can't . i've had a date already . __eou__ that's too bad ! __eou__ maybe some other time .
good morning , jerry . how's everything ? __eou__ fine , just fine . thanks . __eou__ doing anything for lunch ? __eou__ well , as a matter of fact , i've got a lunch date with bob thomas .

have a nice weekend ! __eou__ thanks.you too ! __eou__ do you have any plans ? __eou__ well , my family's away and i can't afford to do much.what about you ? __eou__ oh , i haven't decided what i'm going to do yet .
bob ! __eou__ anne ! i haven't seen you for ages . how've you been ? __eou__ fine , just fine . and you ? __eou__ not bad . it really is great to see you again . w here have you been ? __eou__ guangzhou . i've got a cousin there .
do you like swimming ? __eou__ yes . swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . __eou__ me too . swimming is a very good exercise for health . it combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . it promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . __eou__ i have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . i only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . __eou__ have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? __eou__ yes , but not always . however , i won't let it go if i have a chance .
how do you like these dishes ? __eou__ fine , they are colorful and tasty . __eou__ did you enjoy your dinner ? __eou__ yes , i did . i have never tasted anything like this . __eou__ would you like some more rice ? __eou__ no , thanks . i'm full . __eou__ another piece of meat pie ? __eou__ no , thanks . i'm on diet . __eou__ how about the dessert ? __eou__ ice cream , please .
congratulations on the new house ! __eou__ thanks ! we love it . __eou__ well , you guys worked hard for it . it's really beautiful . __eou__ i'm just not looking forward to cleaning it !
what are you and corey doing for valentine ’ s day this friday ? __eou__ probably nothing . __eou__ you have to do something romantic . __eou__ romantic ? i can't remember what that word means . __eou__ well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! __eou__ ha , ha ! those days are long gone .
what are you doing this saturday ? __eou__ not much . __eou__ do you want to go see a movie ? __eou__ that sounds good . __eou__ what's playing at the century fox ? __eou__ candlelight in the window __eou__ should we go see it ? __eou__ i'd rather not . i don't like horror movies . __eou__ how about ‘ run of the mill ? ’ __eou__ no . i heard that's really boring . __eou__ why don't we go to a concert instead ? __eou__ great idea !
another glass of beer , will you ? __eou__ thanks , i'm enough . __eou__ at least one for your trip . __eou__ i'll have it if you insist .
happy mother's day , mom ! __eou__ thanks ! these are beautiful . you shouldn't have ! __eou__ of course i should have ! you certainly deserve them ! you put up with all of us . __eou__ i forgot what i put up with . in that case , i do deserve these flowers .
have you gone bowling before ? __eou__ no . could you tell me something more about it ? i want to play well . __eou__ there are 10 frames in a bowling game . each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame . __eou__ you just said 10 rounds . __eou__ ' round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms . __eou__ perhaps you can tell me a little more about this . __eou__ hey , slow down . i'll tell you more while playing .
you keep bowling spares but no strike . __eou__ i don't know why , but i think there's something wrong with my hands . i couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . __eou__ i don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . you have no problem with your hands . __eou__ then why couldn't i get strike on the first ball ? __eou__ the problem is you are too nervous . you want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . and when it comes to the i second roll , there's no pressure . that's why you could bowl all those spares . __eou__ really ? i will try again .
are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ yes , are you ? __eou__ i've got my money and my keys , so i'm ready . __eou__ you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? i'd put a coat on if i were you . __eou__ it wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ well , it's started raining since then . look out the window ! it's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ it does , actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ that's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ ok . i'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ i don't know . the weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ i don't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ good idea . that will help us to warm up . __eou__ if i'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ alright . i'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .
i usually bowl with an eight ball . i like the control of a light ball . i can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . __eou__ well . i like them a little heavier . i don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . __eou__ well , let's see which technique is better . i think i'll go up first ... yes ! i hit a strike . i knocked them all down on my first bowl . __eou__ well done . you got them all . you get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . i'ii dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . __eou__ good start . you knocked eight pins down . but you are left with a 7,10 split . unless you can bowl a ufo-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . __eou__ i certainly can try ... no ! it went straight through the wickets .
may i know how old you are ? __eou__ i am 24 . __eou__ what is your date of birth ? __eou__ i was born on april 15 , 1986 .
when and where were you born ? __eou__ i was born in beijing in 1965 . __eou__ you look so young . __eou__ really ? thank you .
hey , tom , i want to learn how to play golf . __eou__ you're really sporty ! __eou__ i want to do everything i can . __eou__ do you have clubs ? __eou__ no . can i rent clubs ? __eou__ there are clubs for beginners . it's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . __eou__ what kinds of clubs ? __eou__ like the seven-piece set . it's only $ 120 . __eou__ i'll buy a set . but you have to teach me . __eou__ okay .
this little wooden stick is called a tee . __eou__ what do you do with it ? __eou__ for the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . __eou__ okay . __eou__ pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers . __eou__ ok . __eou__ position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can . __eou__ hey ! __eou__ not too bad . the goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible . __eou__ got it .
where is your native place ? __eou__ my native place is shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . __eou__ so are you a local ? __eou__ yes , i am a local resident .
i'm sorry , sam . i don't want to go to the folk concert . __eou__ how about going to the theatre ? __eou__ i don't like going to the theatre . __eou__ well , what do you like doing ? __eou__ travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . and you ? __eou__ i like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . __eou__ i like talking to you , too . __eou__ do you want to go to an exhibition ? there is one at the xinghai exhibition hall tomorrow . __eou__ that's a good idea .
where did you go yesterday ? __eou__ i went to play tennis in the public park . __eou__ how often do you play tennis ? __eou__ twice a week . how about you ? __eou__ i seldom play tennis . i prefer football and basketball . __eou__ but it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . __eou__ i usually play with my schoolmates . __eou__ do you like watching football matches ? __eou__ yes , i went to the than he sports center for the football match last sunday .
did you watch the volleyball match last night ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ who won ? __eou__ china . __eou__ what was the score ? __eou__ china beat brazil 3 to 0 . __eou__ wonderful !
do you like traveling ? __eou__ yes , i've just come back from scotland . __eou__ where did you visit ? __eou__ i only had time to visit edinburgh . __eou__ how did you like it ? __eou__ it's fantastic . __eou__ why did you go there ? __eou__ i went there on business . __eou__ and do you have friends there ? __eou__ yes , a lot of friends . __eou__ you must have enjoyed yourself . __eou__ yes , and i look many pictures .
so , is l . a . all it's cracked up to be ? __eou__ well , the stereotype in the movies is that l . a . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . i guess , in the back of my mind , that's what i expected . __eou__ and , is it what you found ? __eou__ well , it is and it's not . the city of l . a . is much bigger and more diverse than i had expected . there are people here from all over the country and all over world , like new york . i've heard people say that in l . a . , everyone is from somewhere else . tha's partly true . so , i've met all kinds of people here . what i'm realizing is that the picture of l . a . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . __eou__ you're right . life isn't always like the movies .
i hear that you've been to the saikei ski resort for the weekend . did you enjoy it ? __eou__ yes , it's so exciting , though i had the most falls in our skiing team . __eou__ isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? __eou__ of course there is . the top-level coaches there are from the state sports general administration . __eou__ could you move smoothly ? __eou__ yes.my face even ached in the icy wind . __eou__ what happened afterwards ? __eou__ i was skiing on and on excitedly until i realized one thing-i could not stop ! you can just imagine how terrified i was . __eou__ poor girl !
how do you like skiing , pat ? __eou__ i love it . all my life i wanted to learn to ski . finally i took lessons last year . __eou__ i suppose skiing is easy for you . __eou__ no , quite the opposite . i thought i'd never stop falling down . then all of a sudden i started skiing much better . __eou__ i see . do you ski often ? __eou__ every chance i get . on weekends i ski all day long . sometimes i even ski at night . __eou__ that sounds great . __eou__ oh , yes . the ski slopes are well lit . it's really nice to ski at night . why don't you learn to ski ? __eou__ not on your life ! i know i'd break my leg __eou__ don't be so frightened . it's just a skill .
hi , monica , how is everything going ? __eou__ everything goes well , but i am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__ why ? you ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__ i just sense . but i cannot grow anymore . my boss is not really supporting me . i am interested in some positions in other jv companies , but i need to do some more in-depth research before i send my application letters out . __eou__ that is important . doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__ certainly , it is very nice talking with you . but i really have to go now . catch you later . __eou__ ok , good luck to you .
it seems that you get antsy when you hear i praise another guy . __eou__ i get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__ how come you think of him that way ? __eou__ because you seem to have lost your vigilance . you should be on the watch out . __eou__ i have no reason to distrust him . he's never caused any harm . __eou__ isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ nothing smells a rat . i told you that he's an all-right guy . __eou__ all-right guy ? all right . let's talk about something else instead .
are you free this weekend , miss rose ? __eou__ yes , i am . what's up ? __eou__ then would you please go to a dance party with me ? __eou__ with pleasure . i suppose you dance often . __eou__ oh , no . as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time . __eou__ but i am told that you dance wonderfully well . __eou__ thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot , right ? __eou__ no . just occasionally . __eou__ what's your favorite dance ? __eou__ it's hard to say , but i do love the foxtrot and waltz . __eou__ how about rock'n'roll ? __eou__ to tell you the truth , i don't like it . it's too noisy . __eou__ and the tango ? __eou__ oh , it's really beautiful , but i just can't do it well . __eou__ don't be so modest . i'm sure you can do it very well . then i'll meet you at six . is that at all right ? __eou__ ok . __eou__ great ! i'm your lucky fellow then .
lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ? __eou__ ok . do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? __eou__ sure . first we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library . __eou__ are we going to walk or drive ? __eou__ the weather is really nice today . let's walk . __eou__ the weather is good now , but i think it's suppose to rain this afternoon . __eou__ alright , then let's take an umbrella . is your brother coming with us ? __eou__ no , he's still sleeping . __eou__ wow , it's already 10:00 am . he must have been up late last night . __eou__ yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 am . __eou__ i hope he can come later . __eou__ i hope so too . i'll give him a call when we get there . __eou__ how do we get to the library from here ? __eou__ it's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . it takes about 10 minutes .

are you sure lucy has it bad for you ? if she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . but if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her . __eou__ i don't know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me . __eou__ and do you really love her ? __eou__ i think i do . i don't think i can be happier with another girl .
how do you think should i handle this problem ? __eou__ you'd just let sleeping dogs lie . __eou__ but i'm already in a lot of trouble with my boss . __eou__ anything you say or do might make it worse . just try to ride out the storm for a while . __eou__ she's always bothering me . what should i do ? __eou__ you'd better leave her alone . __eou__ but she always harps on me . __eou__ just tell her off . __eou__ yes , great !

but sue is indeed beaut . men can hardly resist such a knock-out . __eou__ birds of feather flock together . you must be one of these men . __eou__ i know little of her . i only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . of course , she ’ s diligent , too . __eou__ that ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on .
hello , my name is bill martin and we have a reservation for party tonight . __eou__ yes , what can i do for you ? __eou__ i need to cancel that . we have had a last minute change of plans . __eou__ i see . would you like me to reschedule you for another night ? __eou__ ok , we will let you know as early as possible . by the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? __eou__ certainly . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ that's all right . i hope we can help you at some other time . good-bye . __eou__ good-bye .

wow , is that your sports car ? __eou__ yes , do you like it ? __eou__ i love it ! i used to always want to drive a green jaguar . is it in good condition ? __eou__ yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . it needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ what's wrong with it ? __eou__ well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ when's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ it must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ i thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ they do . once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . it's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ what else is wrong with it ? __eou__ the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ anything else ? __eou__ the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ it costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ well , let me know when you can get it fixed . i ’ d love to go for a ride in it !
you didn't come to work yesterday.what happened ? __eou__ i had to look after my son at home . __eou__ what's wrong with him ? __eou__ he has a fever . __eou__ is he getting better now ? __eou__ i think so.thank you .

annie , what is troubling you ? you look unhappy . __eou__ a man is pursuing me . he was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . __eou__ do you like him ? __eou__ yes , i do like him . __eou__ then why are you hesitating ? __eou__ you know that i have had a series of miserable relationships . last summer , i fell in love with john . but the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . __eou__ one love drives out another . you shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . __eou__ maybe you are right .

i would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could i about it anyway ? __eou__ don ’ t say things like this . please be confident . i think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore . __eou__ don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ? __eou__ in some way , she is more modern . __eou__ if i do try to do anything , i ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear . __eou__ if you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely .
tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . what's wrong with you ? __eou__ lily broke up with me last week . in fact , she dumped me . __eou__ why ? i mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? __eou__ she said it was because we had very different ideas about life . __eou__ do you believe her excuse ? __eou__ of course not . i knew she had fallen in love with another guy . it is difficult to see her move on so quickly . __eou__ come on , buddy , cheer up . why not do some sports with me ? violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . __eou__ thank you , steven . you are really a good friend .

may i invite you to dance with me ? __eou__ sorry , i can't dance . __eou__ never mind , i can teach you . __eou__ is it difficult to learn ? __eou__ no , it is easy . __eou__ how should i do ? __eou__ you just follow me . __eou__ all right . by the way , do you often dance ? __eou__ yup , because dance can relax myself . __eou__ it seems a good way .

will you be joining billy and i at the bar ? __eou__ which one will you be going to ? __eou__ we are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th street . __eou__ sure , i've been meaning to visit that place myself . __eou__ i want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so i should be there by 9 pm . __eou__ ok , can i bring a date with me ? __eou__ certainly . but if there are going to be four of us , i had better make reservations . __eou__ yes . that is a very good idea . it would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . __eou__ then i'ii make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . __eou__ i'll be there . oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? __eou__ not that i know of . why do you ask ? __eou__ i want to make sure i bring enough money for my date and i . __eou__ i hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.you should be fine . __eou__ one last question.is there a dress code there ? __eou__ no , its very casual there . leave your jacket and tie at home . __eou__ perfect . i wanted to have a casual evening tonight . __eou__ i'll see you there at 9pm . __eou__ okay . see you then .
you seem to be very tired . __eou__ yes , i have been working for eight hours . __eou__ why don't you join us to go out for a walk ? __eou__ no , really . i'm not in the mood for it .
we seem to be lost here . __eou__ possibly . __eou__ i suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman . __eou__ not a bit .
steven , why are you so depressed ? __eou__ i'm feeling very sad . i just read the newspaper . __eou__ what's the news ? __eou__ according to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake . __eou__ it's horrible . __eou__ yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area . __eou__ yes . how about donating some money ? __eou__ it's a good idea . but where can we donate money ? __eou__ just find the answer through internet . __eou__ yes , let's do it now .
steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ? __eou__ john , i am just not in the mood for this . __eou__ you look so upset . what's going on ? __eou__ i lost the table tennis game yesterday . __eou__ oh , what a pity ! __eou__ i just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more . __eou__ is it that bad ? it ’ s nothing more than a game . __eou__ my opponent bowled me with the very first ball . i was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis . __eou__ oh , come on ! failure is the mother of success . don ’ t lose heart . i'm sure you'll succeed . __eou__ perhaps you are right . but i still need some time to recover from the failure . __eou__ i understand .
well , i'm thinking of going to see the ballet swan lake by the famous russian national ballet troupe this evening at beijing grand theater . why don't you join me ? __eou__ i'd like to , but i've got to write a term paper . it will be due by this thursday . __eou__ you always work too hard , jim . as the saying goes , all work and no play makes jack a dull boy . you should spare some time for a rest . __eou__ i know it is no good for my health if i am staying in the classroom all day . but how about my paper ? __eou__ just take it easy . come on with me . __eou__ i'm terribly sorry i can't go with you . shall we find some other time ?
i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . __eou__ that's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ yeah , you are right . __eou__ we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced . __eou__ the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ i think you're right . an international response to this problem is needed .
did you see the fashion awards last night ? __eou__ i sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . __eou__ not interested ? __eou__ not really , to be honest . some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . __eou__ but they are showing what will be all the rage next year . __eou__ all the rage with whom ? i never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . __eou__ did you know that fashion is cyclical ? __eou__ what , it keeps coming back ? __eou__ precisely ! for example , flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . now we can start to see them coming back in again . __eou__ flares ? __eou__ they're also known as bell-bottoms . they are a type of trousers . __eou__ it's too complicated . i'll just stick to the plain clothes . __eou__ that's fine , but then you'll always look plain .
how time flies ! why i always feel haven't enough time to work and study ? __eou__ yes , i also felt that . i'm always busy , and have no time for rest . i don ’ t know how to make use of time . __eou__ maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . __eou__ that's a good idea . and in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . __eou__ you are right . let ’ s stop idling around and do something . __eou__ yeah , time is money . we really need to make good use of it .
you know , smoking does do harm to your health . __eou__ yes , you're right . __eou__ why don't you try to give it up ? __eou__ i've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . smoking relaxes me . __eou__ have you ever thought of just cutting down ? you could do it gradually . __eou__ yes , maybe i should have another try .
susan , did you know the four ugliest women in ancient china ? __eou__ no , i only know four great beauties of china . __eou__ there were some famous ugly women in history . __eou__ yeah ? were they famous because of the ugliness ? __eou__ though they were ugly , they had great virtue . __eou__ then who were they ? __eou__ mo mu , thong lichen , meng gang and ran nv . they were well respected . __eou__ it seems that the inner beauty is also important . __eou__ sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful .
jeff , i'm going to the supermarket . do you want to come with me ? __eou__ i think the supermarket is closed now . __eou__ oh , when does it close ? __eou__ it closes at 7:00 on sundays . __eou__ that's too bad . __eou__ don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . it opens at 8: 00 . __eou__ alright . what do you want to do now ? __eou__ let's take a walk for a half an hour . my sister will get here at about 8: 30pm and then we can all go out to dinner . __eou__ where does she live ? __eou__ she lives in san francisco . __eou__ how long has she lived there ? __eou__ i think she's lived there for about 10 years . __eou__ that's a long time . where did she live before that ? __eou__ san diego .
charles , do you have any children ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ how many children do you have ? __eou__ i have two kids . a boy and a girl . __eou__ what are their names ? __eou__ jack and stephanie . __eou__ how old are they ? __eou__ stephanie is 18 and jack is 24 . __eou__ are they in school ? __eou__ stephanie is . she goes to college in washington and jack works in florida . __eou__ what does stephanie study ? __eou__ she studies english . __eou__ is she here now ? __eou__ no , she's at school .

can you believe me ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ please count on my love . __eou__ i will . __eou__ i'll be yours through endless time . __eou__ i see . and i'll always be devoted to you . __eou__ thank you . i know i've nothing to offer you , but i'll never give you reason to cry . __eou__ i'll never hurt you ; i'll never lie . __eou__ my love will grow , like a river to flow . __eou__ it can't be dry , and can't die . __eou__ i don't know whether we are in a dream . __eou__ aha , aha ...
what good sunshine ! let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . __eou__ i've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . i don't need any more sun-tan . __eou__ it's different in my case . i work in the office , so only rarely do i get the chance to get any sun . __eou__ it might be good to you . but please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . you might end up with skin cancer .
we'd like a half-day package . __eou__ we offer many different sea water treatments . __eou__ how many can we choose ? __eou__ the aquamedic pool is included . you can choose three . __eou__ we'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . __eou__ ok . here are your robes . you can go shower first .
that was heaven ! __eou__ the sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you . __eou__ really ? __eou__ but the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body . __eou__ well , whatever it does , i feel transformed !
hey , joshua ! is anny coming with us ? __eou__ yes , why ? __eou__ nothing . i'm just asking . __eou__ just asking ? but why is your face burning like mad ? aha , someone has a crush on anny , doesn't he ? __eou__ who has a crush ? __eou__ come on , josh , don't be such a chicken . if you like her , you've got to tell her . maybe she likes you . __eou__ i'd totally die if she turned me down . __eou__ you've got to let her know . come on ! you've got to take a chance !

flowers for my favorite girl . __eou__ how did you know that i love red roses ? __eou__ that's a secret . here , let me help you with your coat , and we'll be on our way . __eou__ ( at the dance ) that band is playing good music . shall we dance ? __eou__ fine , what do you call this ? __eou__ foxtrot . oh . you're a good dancer . __eou__ really ? thank you . i am thinking the same thing about you . __eou__ i prefer the old style of dance because i enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely .
rose , the weekend is coming . let's discuss what we will do . __eou__ what about going to the zoo on saturday and to the park on sunday ? __eou__ sounds good . but on saturday there's a football final . __eou__ then , what shall we do on sunday . __eou__ let me see . we can visit the country . we haven't done that for such a long time . __eou__ good idea . i'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . we'll go to the zoo and the park another time . after all , we can put that off . __eou__ ok .
what a nice dress , jean.you look marvelous ! __eou__ you , too . where did you get your new hat ? __eou__ from the crown's . oh , what lovely earrings you have ! are they diamond ? __eou__ yes . it's a birthday present from my husband ! __eou__ well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . __eou__ he'll come out with surprises . just wait and see . look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! __eou__ she's chic , isn't she ? __eou__ yes . i like the dress . it must be the latest fashion . look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . __eou__ it makes me feel rather shabby . that woman has a good taste in dressing , i would say . __eou__ yes . she dressed with an individual flair . i rather envy her . __eou__ most women follow fashion like sheep.they don't know any better than imitate . __eou__ i quite agree with you.see the woman there ? i dare say she hasn't got any eyes . how could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? and all that jewelry ! __eou__ the gown is quite expensive , believe me . __eou__ so what ? it only makes her look cheap and vulgar . __eou__ you know those upstarts . they're all show-offs ! i think i'd better have a diet ; otherwise i'd look like a ballon soon . __eou__ you're quite slim . in fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . __eou__ thanks . i'm flattered . __eou__ oh , my shoes pinch me . let's find a seat and sit a while .
at the beijing olympics , all four table tennis events were all-chinese finals . a clean sweep again ! __eou__ yes . all international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of chinese supremacy in the sport . __eou__ do you know any secrets to china's success ? __eou__ in the first place , i think the whole nation is just fond of the game . it is well grounded with the mass . with huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . __eou__ so , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . __eou__ sure . there is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ they are subject to hard training . and you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . they are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . __eou__ oh , dear ! it's an encroachment on individual rights ! __eou__ well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . that's why many people think such rules acceptable . after all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money .
hi , bill . i saw you yesterday with a pretty girl . __eou__ yes , she is my favorite girl . i've decided to go steady with her . __eou__ are you sure she is the right girl ? __eou__ sure . she is the ideal girl , the one i had dreamed of . __eou__ what type of girl is she ? __eou__ she is the mature , stable , feminine type . i hope one day i can marry her . __eou__ oh , that's great . you're serious this time .
it's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week . __eou__ indeed . i love the smell of the grass and trees . they certainly refresh my mind . __eou__ can we stop here for a while ? my backpack is very heavy . __eou__ sure . did you hear anything ? look ! an eagle is hovering in the sky . __eou__ let me see . it's not an eagle . i think it's a vulture . __eou__ yes . will it hurt us ? __eou__ i don't think so . let's walk by the stream . i am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . __eou__ ok . i have a good pair of hiking boots . it should not be a big problem . __eou__ i also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . if you are hungry , you can let me know . __eou__ you are kind . look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__ well , it is a birch tree.it is not as old as you think . __eou__ how do you know ? __eou__ because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree .
sarah , what did you do today ? __eou__ i went shopping . __eou__ did you buy anything ? __eou__ yes , i bought a few things . __eou__ what did you buy ? __eou__ i bought this coat . do you like it ? __eou__ yeah , i like it a lot . it's very pretty . where did you buy it ? __eou__ at the mall on 5th street . __eou__ was it expensive ? __eou__ no , it wasn't expensive . it was on sale for 20 dollars . __eou__ that's cheap . __eou__ i know . it was a really good deal . __eou__ i don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . it's been really hot lately .

i know i'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , john ? __eou__ honey , we're in the museum now . we're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . we're here to enjoy the great paintings by picasso ! __eou__ i know ! but it's really important to her ! her whole life could be ruined by this man ! __eou__ you're making a federal case out of it . one unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . it could even make your life more interesting . __eou__ are you serious , john ? __eou__ all i'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting .
can we sit on the grass , darling ? __eou__ no , you can't , darling . the grass is wet . __eou__ look , darling ! i can see a bench near that tree . __eou__ no , you can't . the bench is wet , too . __eou__ it's not raining , darling . the bench isn't wet . __eou__ can't you see a notice on the bench ? __eou__ yes , i can . __eou__ what does the notice say ? __eou__ it says ' wet paint ! '
hi melissa , are you going home this weekend ? __eou__ no , not this weekend . i have too much work to do . __eou__ where do your parents live ? __eou__ my father lives in washington dc . __eou__ how about your mother ? __eou__ my mother died two years ago . __eou__ oh , i am sorry to hear that . is your father still working ? __eou__ no , he's retired . __eou__ do you have any family here ? __eou__ yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here . __eou__ do you have any brothers or sisters ? __eou__ yes , i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston . __eou__ do you see them a lot ? __eou__ not as much as i'd like to . usually just on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas .

i want to say ... __eou__ say it ! what is it ? __eou__ that i can't go on any longer without you . __eou__ you know you shouldn't say that at a time like this . __eou__ nancy , i made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight . __eou__ too sudden ! i'm not ready for it . __eou__ forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments . __eou__ stop it . no more of that talk . __eou__ i really love you . __eou__ no , i shall faint . __eou__ and i hope so . this is what you were meant for . say you love me , say yes , say yes . __eou__ yes .

what are you doing there with your mobile phone ? __eou__ i'm moblogging ! __eou__ moblogging ? what does that mean ? __eou__ oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . it's another form of blogging . users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . __eou__ sounds interesting ! that must be very convenient . __eou__ yes , you're right . i can blog wherever and whenever i'm on the move . it's especially good when i'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . __eou__ how can you do that ? __eou__ well , if i simply want to write a few words , i'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . __eou__ what if you want to publish some photos ? __eou__ then i'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . __eou__ i see . moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . __eou__ you bet it !
jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? __eou__ that depends . what does she look like ? __eou__ well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . __eou__ how tall is she ? __eou__ she's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . __eou__ is she chubby ? __eou__ not at all . she's actually very athletic . __eou__ it sounds like she's pretty good-looking . does she wear glasses ? __eou__ no , but she does wear contact lenses . __eou__ how's her skin ? __eou__ she's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . __eou__ does she have any piercings or tattoos ? __eou__ i think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot . __eou__ what's the tattoo on her foot like ? __eou__ it's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one . __eou__ even her mother ? __eou__ yes , even her mother . __eou__ what's her personality like ? __eou__ she's a lot like me . __eou__ so there is something wrong with her ! it was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true !
can you tell bob from tom ? __eou__ how can i ? they're as alike as two peas in a pod . __eou__ don't you notice that bob has a mole on his face , but tom does not . __eou__ you really have keen eyes .

today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet . __eou__ is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me . __eou__ yes , i think so . my friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the internet . __eou__ there's no doubt the internet will be a powerful commercial medium . it'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . __eou__ that's true . i can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . __eou__ yeah . it'll be a shoppers heaven . that's the use of net in e-commerce .
hello , daisy , how are you doing ? __eou__ fine , thank you . i haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . what have you been up to recently ? __eou__ i have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . recently , i've been obsessed with horror films . __eou__ oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? they're so scary . __eou__ yeah , you are right i used to not watch horror films , but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month , i fell in love with them . __eou__ it's amazing . but if i were you , i wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . __eou__ but it's really exciting . __eou__ maybe , but i would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . __eou__ basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . __eou__ yep . __eou__ i think you should have a try someday . maybe you'll change your mind . __eou__ maybe . after all , i am grown up now .
did you read the news that ' china's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in december , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? __eou__ no . does the newspaper say what has caused that ? __eou__ yes . it says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . __eou__ i think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . __eou__ right . the climbing property prices has become a headache for chinese residents .

terrible . how about people's lives ? __eou__ fortunately , there is no person died . __eou__ that's great . it seems that typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . __eou__ yeah . earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . __eou__ that's why many people died in the earthquake . __eou__ well , china is located on the eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other . __eou__ oh , china does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . __eou__ yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in wenchman . __eou__ we're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face wenchman earthquake . __eou__ right . but people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . life is the most important compared with anything else . __eou__ that's the point . love among human beings is not limited by geography .

not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . i can't believe it ! __eou__ can't bear it , right ? i've been there before . i'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . __eou__ yeah , that's right . if no one sends me text messages , i'll go crazy . __eou__ actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' . __eou__ addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! __eou__ yes , it is . do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ? __eou__ absolutely . __eou__ do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? __eou__ yeah , it's a must . otherwise , i may miss important phone calls and text messages . __eou__ do you open all your im tools whenever you're using a computer ? __eou__ yes . msn , qq , skype , google talk , ali wangwang , everything , so that i'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . __eou__ now i can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information
are you a blogger ? __eou__ sure i am . i've been writing a blog for almost three years . __eou__ oh , it seems that i'm the only one who never blogs . when did you get started ? __eou__ i began blogging when i first went to the us for my graduate strides . __eou__ what do you usually write about ? __eou__ at first , i'll write about my life there . like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special english words that i come across . sometimes , i'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going . __eou__ that's interesting . how often do you write a blog ? __eou__ it's random . if there happen to be a lot of things going on , i may add several new entries in a week , and if i've got nothing to share , i may leave my blog untouched for weeks . __eou__ got it . are you still updating your blog ? __eou__ sure , since i came back from the us , i've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic i like . __eou__ good for you . i know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .

you haven't spent much time with sophia lately . are you speaking to each other at the moment ? __eou__ no , we're not . we've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__ but you two used to do everything together . i thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__ we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__ can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__ i could , but all they ever talk about is work , so i always end up feeling left out . __eou__ maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__ i tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! she's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__ it can't be that bad . she was always a really good friend to you . __eou__ you're right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__ she's probably just excited about her new job . you should give her some time . it would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__ i've given her enough time . i'm over it now . __eou__ i still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__ i think i just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways .
how did you spend the weekend ? __eou__ i went to a movie with my boyfriend . __eou__ really ? how was it ? __eou__ it was great . the director took a lot of care while framing . they say be has good chance at winning the oscar for best director . also i like the actors , some really great new young actors . __eou__ oh , yeah ? what's it about ? __eou__ well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . but besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . there is some really dramatic footage . it's really quite a visual feast . and the soundtrack is moving . __eou__ sounds pretty good . is it a tragedy ? __eou__ the ending is a bit of a surprise . i don't want to ruin it for you . __eou__ oh , i like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . maybe i should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . __eou__ it would be a really good choice . the movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . i'm sure you won't regret it .
did roll win the race ? __eou__ yeah , he did . but he only won it by a hair's breadth . __eou__ but anyway , he won at last . __eou__ yeah . to win is the most important thing .

have you heard about michael's new home ? it's in one of the poshest areas in this area . __eou__ is he living in the new housing estate in killington ? __eou__ no , he's living in an old house in warton . __eou__ do you mean the one near the health centre on old slate road ? __eou__ that's the one . __eou__ his house must be worth millions ! that is one of the most beautiful areas in oxford . the surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . how can he afford that place ? __eou__ he didn't buy it . his grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . __eou__ did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ? __eou__ no one in the family expected to get a dime from him . it was quite a surprise . __eou__ what a lucky man . __eou__ he still has a complaint though . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ he wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop . __eou__ the poor thing . it must be difficult being him . __eou__ you can say that again .
what's the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ um , very nice . it's warm in spring and cool in autumn . __eou__ is it hot in summer ? __eou__ yes , it is , but not as hot as in beijing .
let's invite bobbie and john to our party , ok ? __eou__ you can never do that . __eou__ why ? __eou__ there's been bad blood between them since bobbie took away john's girlfriend .
some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . __eou__ yeah . they take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . __eou__ i was fooled once . a lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . so i gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . but later i learned that she had lied to me . __eou__ you are still wet behind the ears . you should have seen through her . __eou__ nothing rang a bell .
sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a barbie doll . __eou__ i don ’ t know whether i am a barbie doll or you are one . __eou__ maybe i am a barbie doll , but i won ’ t do barbie doll things . __eou__ well , i am not going to flog a dead horse . let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up .
wow ! what a beautiful scenic spot ! it's so open . and just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . __eou__ you can have a bird view of guiling city from the top of the mountain . __eou__ wonderful ! i'll often come here for mountain climbing . __eou__ you should . many guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning . __eou__ no wonder people say __eou__ quick ! pass me your binoculars . look at that bird ... i've never seen one of those before . it's indigenous to guiling , and an endangered species too . this is lucky ! __eou__ i didn't know you liked bird-watching . __eou__ i don't really . i just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it .
i'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . i need your understanding . __eou__ i know , i know . but you always bat around without doing things useful . __eou__ can ’ t you be more considerate ? i need your encouragement . __eou__ all right . do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs .
what a beautiful view . __eou__ it sure is . the grand canyon is truly a masterpiece . no man could ever make anything like this . __eou__ what is that below ? __eou__ it is the colorado river . you can go down the river in a boat if you wish . __eou__ no . thank you . it looks a bit too dangerous for me . __eou__ there is a beautiful state park here . i can see why so many people come out here to camp . __eou__ yes , there is beautiful view . you can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . __eou__ it definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . __eou__ that's true .
how many people are there in your family ? __eou__ my immediate family is quite small . it ’ s just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . how about you ? __eou__ i have a large family . i have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents . __eou__ i didn ’ t know you were a twin ! are you identical or fraternal ? __eou__ we ’ re identical . i mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else . __eou__ interesting . it must be great having a twin sister . are you best friends , too ? __eou__ we used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to shanghai . how about your family ? you didn ’ t mention to your biological father . __eou__ i don ’ t know much about him . he died when i was just a baby . even though i don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , i consider them to be my real family . __eou__ what about your step-brother ’ s mother ? does he keep in touch with her ? __eou__ no , she also died when my step-brother was little . my mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . they ended up getting married a few years later . __eou__ sounds like it was meant to be .
have you ever thought about having children , kaitlyn ? __eou__ my husband and i have thought about it , but we ’ ve decided not to have any . they are just too expensive . besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . what about you ? __eou__ well , i ’ ve always wanted to have lots of children . growing up with only one brother , i always felt a bit lonely . what do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ for me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn ’ t ever have to share . __eou__ don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ? __eou__ no way ! i spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home . what do you think of the one-child policy in china ? __eou__ if china didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ? __eou__ that ’ s true . but as a woman , i ’ m glad that even though i don ’ t want any children , i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand , i can ’ t imagine what china would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy ! __eou__ do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? __eou__ i don ’ t know what other people think , but i , for one , envy only children !
how is everything going with your girlfriend ? __eou__ didn ’ t i tell you ? it ’ s over ! __eou__ oh , i am sorry to hear that . i did ’ t know that you had split up . what happened ? __eou__ it was a few things . the first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! __eou__ really ! did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? __eou__ no , but i ended up finding out later that night when i saw her with another man at a club near my home ! __eou__ what was she thinking ? did you confront her about it when you saw her ? __eou__ i wanted to , but i knew that if i spoke to her , i'd just blow up at her , so i decided to just go home . i called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . __eou__ i can ’ t believe she would do that to you . it ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! __eou__ i know . i still haven ’ t heard from her . the good thing is that i ’ m so angry with her that i don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . __eou__ i bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . you were such a good catch ! she really lost out , didn ’ t she ? __eou__ i guess so . it would be nice to know why she did this though . __eou__ i know . it ’ s always nice to have some closure , but i don ’ t think you ’ ll have a problem finding another girlfriend .
what are you doing tonight ? __eou__ i have to run to the grocery store . __eou__ don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? __eou__ yes , but i am out of food and milk . __eou__ what store do you shop at ? __eou__ the small one , just down the street . i like their generic brand . __eou__ i have been using the store across town for years . __eou__ i hear they have very nice stuff . __eou__ they do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . __eou__ well , you should try my store . the prices are good . __eou__ i will sometime . thanks for the advice .
how was your holiday to cyprus ? __eou__ it was so fantastic i didn ’ t really want to come home . __eou__ did you happen to meet someone ? __eou__ how did you know ? __eou__ you always act like this when you ’ ve fallen in love . who is he ? how did you meet ? __eou__ his name is tony and we met my first night in pathos . he works with my sister who lives there . __eou__ was it love at first sight ? __eou__ not really . i wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . i didn ’ t think i ’ d have anything to lose , so i went . __eou__ and ? __eou__ let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love . __eou__ that happened quickly ! are you going to see him again ? __eou__ luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated . __eou__ it sounds like he is madly in love with you . are you ready for such a serious relationship ? __eou__ well , i ’ m not really a spring chicken anymore . we don ’ t know what will happen .
how are you doing , andrew ? __eou__ not well . i ’ ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . __eou__ but you have so many friends ! how could you be lonely ? __eou__ you know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . i don ’ t feel like i really know any of my friends . in fact , i should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . __eou__ what about me ? i ’ m your friend . __eou__ i know you are , you are my girlfriend . i wish i had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . __eou__ i know what you mean . i find it difficult to make new friends , too . it ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? __eou__ not at all . __eou__ i ’ ve made a lot of new friends since i started learning english . maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . __eou__ what kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ i ’ m not sure . i guess i ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . __eou__ people who play ultimate frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate frisbee club . __eou__ that ’ s a possibility . thanks !
what was your wedding ceremony like , abigail ? __eou__ my husband and i got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . but then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__ three parties ? that's quite a lot . that must have been expensive ! __eou__ well , since my husband and i are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . it wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__ were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__ i would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__ did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__ my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . __eou__ that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__ we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa . __eou__ you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__ not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
what are you doing now , steven ? __eou__ i am reading a book about money management . __eou__ oh , my god . do you want to be a millionaire ? i can see you are very crazy about money . __eou__ everyone wants to earn a lot of money . don't you think so ? what's more , i am interested in money management . __eou__ no , you are wrong . money can't buy happiness and health . i won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . in other words , i don't want to be a millionaire and i want to have more free time to enjoy life . __eou__ oh , i see . but a proverb says " money makes the mare go . " i think it will be better if you have more money . __eou__ maybe you are right . please take care of yourself when you make money . anyway health is the most important thing . __eou__ thank you for your caring . i will . __eou__ no thanks .
you like movies ? __eou__ yeah , i think it's the best way to relax . __eou__ what type do you like the best ? __eou__ really it depends on my mood . when i am sad or depressed , i like comedies . if i'm feeling good , i'll watch almost anything . __eou__ i see . i generally like movies to help calm me down . i think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . __eou__ yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . __eou__ true . the movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . you see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . i generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . you can name a lot of classics from that decade . __eou__ yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . they've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . __eou__ i'm totally with you on that .
have you thought of moving at all , sarah ? __eou__ we ’ ve thought about it , but my husband and i can ’ t afford it right now . the only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something i don ’ t want to do . __eou__ buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . you ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . do you know anyone who has done that before ? __eou__ sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . they ’ re pretty satisfied with it . __eou__ is the house pretty run-down . __eou__ not at all . the woman , who owned it , took good care of it . but when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . __eou__ was it a very old house ? __eou__ it was about 75 years old . there were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . __eou__ is it in a good location ? __eou__ the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok .
the question is easy for everybody.don ' t you think so ? __eou__ yeah , it's very easy . but it's above nick's head __eou__ why do you say so ? __eou__ he's always confused by easy questions .
have you ever seen bill gate's home on the internet ? __eou__ no . what's it like ? __eou__ it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . the house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . it's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . it's absolutely amazing ! __eou__ would you want to live there ? __eou__ i think his house is fantastic , but i wouldn't want to live there . you would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . it's just too big of a place to take care of on your own . __eou__ what's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__ my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in england . __eou__ would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__ old homes are great because they've got character . i think that's important . __eou__ is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? because they've got character ? __eou__ no , that's just because i don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__ i see . if you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__ no , i'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . i love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more !
this historian is famous in the field of tang dynasty . __eou__ so he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it . __eou__ right , to be famous to be respectable in some way . __eou__ you got it .
hello , tom ! do you have plans for this evening ? __eou__ nothing special . __eou__ how about having dinner with me ? __eou__ that's great . i would love to . and when ? __eou__ let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , ok ? __eou__ no problem . however , maybe i should come early to help you prepare the dinner . __eou__ don ’ t worry . i will arrange everything . __eou__ all right , see you tonight . __eou__ see you .
you have a nice apartment . __eou__ thank you . my wife would be very happy to hear this . __eou__ she must have done a lot of work on it . __eou__ you bet .
hello , tom . how do you find the dinner of yesterday ? __eou__ very good . that may be the most delicious food i have ever eaten . __eou__ it's nice of you to say so . __eou__ i really appreciate you for having invited me . __eou__ don't mention it . you know , we ’ re old friends . __eou__ anyway , i owe you one . are you free tonight ? __eou__ yes . why ? __eou__ i want to invite you to enjoy the food i cook . __eou__ that ’ s great . i'd love to .
could you lend your bike to me for several days ? __eou__ how long would you like to keep it ? __eou__ till the end of the week . __eou__ yes , that'd be all right .
how do you arrange this summer vacation ? __eou__ i want to travel . __eou__ where would you like to go ? __eou__ the seaside . __eou__ that's really a good idea . taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . i recommend you qingdao or dalian . __eou__ i ’ ve been to qingdao before , so i ’ ll choose dalian . i've heard that the environment there is very good . __eou__ yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . last year i went there . it's really . __eou__ thank you !
can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ? __eou__ ok , you name the day . __eou__ how about the second of march ? __eou__ what day is that ? __eou__ it's friday . __eou__ good . where shall we meet ?
jack , i hear you got promoted.is that true ? __eou__ yes . i think i'm lucky . __eou__ oh , jack , you deserve it.you ' ve been working so hard . __eou__ thank you for saying that .
hi ! tom . want to go to play bowling tonight ? __eou__ sounds good . when and where shall we meet ? __eou__ let me see . how about 6:30 at the gate of the club ? __eou__ fine , see you then .
now , you are to board the plane.we ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in china . __eou__ i appreciate what you have done for me.everything i have seen here has left a deep impression on me . i really don't know how to express my thanks to you . __eou__ we are ready to help you . __eou__ will you be kind to say " thank you " to mr.zhang and other friends for me ? __eou__ i'd like to . i'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.welcome to china again . __eou__ of course , i will.well , it's time for me to say goodbye.the plane will take off soon.hope some day you will come to america for a visit . __eou__ thank you . i will if i have chance.goodbye and happy landing ! __eou__ goodbye !
i don ’ t know what i ’ m going to do ! it ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if i lose my job ! __eou__ don ’ t worry . i don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__ it was a rather big mistake . when you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__ but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? you were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . __eou__ that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . there ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . i ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing i can do about that . my boss won ’ t believe me if i tell him the truth . __eou__ let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . how much money do you have in your savings ? __eou__ i have enough to live off of for about 3 months . but i really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! i ’ d rather invest my money somehow . __eou__ well , you can't have everything . let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . when is your contract up on your apartment ? __eou__ next month . so i can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . __eou__ well , that ’ s good . if you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . that will save you plenty of money . __eou__ that ’ s very generous of you . i guess that would work . __eou__ if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . if you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . __eou__ i guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . maybe losing my job would be a good thing !
what's the most popular sport in your country ? __eou__ table tennis . __eou__ do you play table tennis ? __eou__ not really , but i like watching .
do you know how to go to the fragrant hills in beijing ? i heard that they are very famous in china . __eou__ yes . especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . __eou__ that must be very beautiful . __eou__ yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . __eou__ really ? have you ever been there ? __eou__ a couple of times . __eou__ can you go there with me ? i'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me . __eou__ sure . i'd be very glad to be your tour guide .
hello , hanson . today i come to say goodbye to you , for i'm going back to london tomorrow . __eou__ no , not so soon . couldn ’ t i persuade you to stay a couple of days more ? __eou__ much as i wish to but i really can ’ t . i've already booked the flight . __eou__ i hope this won ’ t be our last meeting . __eou__ of course not . you can come to london to visit me in future . and i also will come here if i have a chance . __eou__ i will miss you . __eou__ i will miss you , too . you're really a good friend . __eou__ it's a pity that i'm too busy to see you off tomorrow . __eou__ it doesn't matter . __eou__ take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch . __eou__ i will . __eou__ goodbye and have a good flight . __eou__ thankyou . goodbye !

what are your hobbies ? __eou__ sports . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ basketball and swimming .
good morning ! __eou__ good morning , gav ! did you sleep well last night ? __eou__ i slept like a baby . i fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares ! __eou__ that's great news ! you look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . __eou__ i feel much better , but i'm still worried about something . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ well , i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and i'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . __eou__ that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . __eou__ for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because i'm pretty impatient . how can i prevent myself from getting stressed if i get stuck in a traffic jam ? __eou__ just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . __eou__ ok , i'll try that . __eou__ is there anything else bothering you ? __eou__ just one more thing . a school called me this morning to see if i could teach a few classes this weekend and i don't know what to do . __eou__ do you have any other plans this weekend ? __eou__ i'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on monday . __eou__ try not to take on more than you can handle . __eou__ you're right . i probably should just work on my paper . thanks !
steven , have you ever met hanson ever since he went back to london ? __eou__ no , but we still stay in touch . __eou__ what's the way you keep in contact ? __eou__ we contact through email . __eou__ email is not always the best form . i think qq is way better . __eou__ your words sound a bit reasonable . but don ’ t forget the time difference . __eou__ you're right .

smith is always careless , it is his achilles ’ s heel . __eou__ he would get very angry if anyone criticized him . __eou__ he will burn his fingers . __eou__ if only he knew it .

ashley , what a great dinner party ! __eou__ thank you , joe . what would you like to drink with your meal ? i can offer you wine , mango juice , or water . __eou__ just water would be fine . __eou__ excellent choice . can i dish you up some chicken ? __eou__ yes , the chicken looks wonderful ! __eou__ how about some salad to go with your chicken ? __eou__ sure , i love salad ! __eou__ would you like to have rice with your chicken ? __eou__ yes , i think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken ! __eou__ good ! julie , if you could pass this plate down to joe , i think we are all set .

hi julie , how are things going ? __eou__ everything is great , tad . how are you ? __eou__ i'm doing really well . __eou__ tad , i'm pretty hungry right now . want to walk over and check out the food table ? __eou__ julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ? __eou__ that is mary . i heard that she's just moved in with lee . __eou__ i thought that he was with malia . __eou__ oh , that relationship is history . malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday . __eou__ i bet that lee wasn't too happy with that ! __eou__ actually , he was ok with it . they hadn't been getting along too well .
he always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans . __eou__ i know this characteristic of him . so i never think seriously of his words . __eou__ yeah . this is a clever way to be in contact with such a person . __eou__ it seems that you don't like him . __eou__ you like to communicate with him ?
how are you feeling , john ? __eou__ oh , not too bad , but i've got to stay in bed . __eou__ do more exercises after you are healthy . __eou__ ok , i will . you have said that many times . __eou__ are you hungry ? do you want me to buy something for you to eat ? __eou__ no , there ’ s no need . thank you all the same .
happy birthday ! this is for you , kate . __eou__ thanks , miss . wang . __eou__ you know in china we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . __eou__ really ? i've already opened it . great ! and it is exactly after my fancy . thank you very much .
hello . i'm jason . __eou__ hi . my name is dolma . __eou__ nice to meet you , dolma . __eou__ good to meet you too .
maybe we all will be all things to all men . __eou__ how terrible ! __eou__ but for the life , we'll be changed by this society . __eou__ i really don't want to go into the world , i feel afraid of it . __eou__ don't be silly . we have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves . __eou__ i know .
excuse me , i'd like to ask you a few questions about the city . __eou__ ok , please . __eou__ my wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? __eou__ i would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . it has a wide range of shops and restaurants . __eou__ thank you . also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . can you recommend some local attractions ? __eou__ how old are your children ? __eou__ i have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl . __eou__ i would recommend a day at the zoo . it's fun for all the family . there is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . __eou__ it sounds marvelous . thank you for your help .
excuse me . i don't think we have met before . my name is mary jenson . __eou__ oh , hello . i'm bias chettri . __eou__ good to meet you , mr chettri . __eou__ pleased to meet you too , ms jenson .
we should keep frank at arm's length . __eou__ yeah . he's known as a sly dog . he's done many people in . __eou__ he hits below the belt . __eou__ and he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided .
now i know why i split up with mike . we found we were simply not good for each other . __eou__ in what ways ? __eou__ well , he is a typical sagittarius guy , while i am a cancer . we aren't really compatible __eou__ ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? __eou__ what's strange about that ! as a person born under the sign of cancer , i am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . but according to astrology , sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.they seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . __eou__ is that so ? i'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . it's all stereotypes ! __eou__ but in my case , the fact matches the theory . mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . it frightens me ! __eou__ but as far as i remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . __eou__ exactly . but later on , he cares more about his career than love . work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me .
hello , alice . would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? __eou__ temple fair ? __eou__ yes . the ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . __eou__ sounds interesting ! __eou__ absolutely , i love temple fairs . beijing has several temple fairs recently . they are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . __eou__ i just can't wait to see them . which one do you choose today ? __eou__ what about tianqiao temple fair ? a variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . __eou__ great ! do you know how to get there ? __eou__ of course . __eou__ couldn't be better .
what had make you so upset ? __eou__ frank has gone out with lucy again . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with that ? __eou__ lucy is known as a social butterfly . she has taken many rich men for a ride , you know .
i hear that you are in love with mike . __eou__ you are kidding . __eou__ don't you hit it off ? __eou__ although we have many things in common , we'are not soul mates .
what a beautiful view , my sweetheart ! __eou__ it sure is.the grand canyon is truly masterpiece . no man could ever make anything like this . __eou__ what is that below ? __eou__ it is the colorado river . you will go down the river in a boat if you wish . __eou__ no , thank you.it looks a bit too dangerous for me . __eou__ there is a beautiful state park here . i can see why so many people come out here to camp . __eou__ yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . __eou__ it definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . __eou__ you are so romantic , my sweetheart .
i met mark yesterday . he looked blue . __eou__ he ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ? __eou__ it belongs to the past . he lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now . __eou__ it seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time .
what did you say ? __eou__ i said he was nothing but a yeoman . __eou__ then he become angry with you ? __eou__ yes .
i would back him up to the hilt anyway . __eou__ why are you so kind to him ? __eou__ he's my brother . __eou__ so that's how it is ! now he ’ s in trouble , but i belive he will rise to his own feet again . __eou__ thanks for your belief .
how is grandpa doing recently ? __eou__ not good . the doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back ! __eou__ maybe i would talk with him someday . __eou__ i hope it will be of some use .
the poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day . __eou__ yeah , she has a lot of homework . __eou__ today's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them . __eou__ right . so in some way we are happier . __eou__ yeah , at least when we are children , we have not so much homework to do .
look , it's all water over the dam now . let's leave it behind us . __eou__ yeah , i know , but it's too hard to do . __eou__ our eyes should look into the future . we could not live in the past . __eou__ only sometimes when i think about it , i feel very sad . __eou__ it's normal . time will change everything .
it's said that john's broken up . __eou__ really ? but his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . __eou__ i hear that john's leading a double wife . __eou__ it's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
i don't know how to deal with jack . he is indeed a trouble maker . he has loused up my business several times . __eou__ you mean lily's boyfriend ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ well , he is a hard case . everyone would feel headache about him .
bob is really disturbed these days . __eou__ we'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with him . __eou__ but we cannot talk like elders . __eou__ of course not . let's talk to him in a very friendly way .
don't have some relation with him . you know , he is not a kind man . __eou__ yeah . sometimes i just cannot accept his behavior . __eou__ if you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a roland for an oliver . __eou__ ok , it ’ s better to be far away from him .
it is high time you have a talk with him . that may help clear the mists . __eou__ i did , but he gives me a runaround . __eou__ if i were you , i would put the whole matter on the table . __eou__ but he was trying to beat about the bush . and my talk with him was fruitless .
mr . lin , what are you interested in ? __eou__ i enjoy camping . __eou__ really ? i'm not much of an outdoor person . what do you like about it ? __eou__ i love the fresh air , the scenery the exercise , and the time to think . __eou__ do you hike or fish on your trips ? __eou__ yes , both . last trip i fished a little and hiked five miles . __eou__ did you catch anything ? __eou__ yes , but i threw them back . __eou__ how about joining our summer camp next week ? __eou__ great ! i can't wait .
how do you like tom ? __eou__ i like him very much . he ’ s a gay dog . __eou__ are you ready to welcome him ? __eou__ i am all set . he can come anytime .
hi , craig ! how are you ? __eou__ not so good . i have a terrible cold . __eou__ really ? that's too bad ! you should be at home in bed . it's really important to get a lot of rest . __eou__ yeah , you're right . __eou__ and have you taken anything for it ? __eou__ no , i haven't . __eou__ well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . then drink a cup every half hour . it really works ! __eou__ ugh !
don't be too sad . if you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem . __eou__ i know clearly at the bottom of my heart . i just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . she's little . she cannot understand us and accept such truth . __eou__ yeah , child is the matter . don't tell jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . when she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . __eou__ i see . ok .
it seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . __eou__ yeah . __eou__ why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? __eou__ i have found myself a date mate . __eou__ you must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . __eou__ a barrel of fun , of course . he often says that i'm a date bait .
do you know who that tall man is ? __eou__ i don ’ t know . but he must be a big shot . __eou__ why ? __eou__ because everyone is trying to butter him up .
how is he ? __eou__ not very well . he was white about the gills . __eou__ did he see the doctor ? __eou__ yeah , but he refused to take the medicine . __eou__ why ? __eou__ i don't know the reason .
i hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? __eou__ yeah , it happened a week ago . __eou__ that's a crying shame . it really is ! __eou__ fortunately , she's not seriously injured .
do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? __eou__ i used to be an atheist . but in recent months , i couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . __eou__ that sounds interesting . have you been involved in any mystery ? __eou__ not exactly , except that i find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . i came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . it is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . __eou__ what did it say about you then ? __eou__ for example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that i , as a leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . and as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . lasi night , i was treated to a dinner party by mr . lee . __eou__ but it must have been only a coincidence . that's the only way superstition wins over science . __eou__ oh , no . you can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.if horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . __eou__ for fun . it serves as a shared topic to them.while they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . when it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . but if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual .
are you going to the party on saturday ? __eou__ i was thinking about it . are you ? __eou__ yeah , i heard it's going to be a lot of fun . __eou__ really ? well , what time does it start ? __eou__ it starts at 8 __eou__ well , who all is going to be there ? __eou__ everyone from school . __eou__ how do you know it's going to be so fun ? __eou__ this party is going to have a dj , food , and drinks . __eou__ wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . __eou__ so am i going to see you at the party ? __eou__ yeah , i will be there .
hey , robert , what are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ i didn't have any big plans . __eou__ we are putting together a birthday party for mary . __eou__ that sounds like fun . where will it be ? __eou__ we thought it would be fun to have a pool party at jay's house . __eou__ oh good ! can i bring anything ? __eou__ we will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . __eou__ i am assuming that the dress is casual . __eou__ dress casually and bring your bathing suit ! __eou__ wonderful . just e-mail me the time and date and i'll be there .
what are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ i am not sure . what are you doing ? __eou__ i was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . __eou__ that sounds like a great idea ! __eou__ would you be interested in joining me ? __eou__ sure , i would love to go with you . when would you be leaving ? __eou__ i thought that we could leave around 8 __eou__ that would give us plenty of time to explore . did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in santa barbara ? __eou__ that was part of my plan . __eou__ well then , i'll see you on saturday . thanks for asking me to go with you .
mr . lee , i was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next friday night ? __eou__ yes , i think we might be free . what did you have in mind ? __eou__ i've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . __eou__ that sounds great . is it casual ? __eou__ actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . __eou__ that sounds good . it will give my wife a chance to dress up . __eou__ yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people . __eou__ that sounds wonderful . will there be anyone there that i know ? __eou__ oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . __eou__ great ! i'll look forward to it . we'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation .
joe , how are you doing ? __eou__ pretty good . mary , i was wondering if you would like to come to a party on friday night ? __eou__ i am free that night , and a party sounds good . __eou__ fine . it will be at my house . do you know how to get there ? __eou__ i kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ? __eou__ i can do that . do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ? __eou__ i would really like to bring my friend jake , if that would be ok . __eou__ oh yeah , i remember jake . that would be fine . __eou__ would you like some help with the food ? __eou__ just bring along whatever it is that you and jake would like to drink .
it's raining outside , catherine , it's too bad.what ' s the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ it's very hot , the temperature is often over 40 ° c . __eou__ do you like the weather in seattle ? __eou__ not really.but i like it in spring and fall . i don't like it in winter . __eou__ why ? __eou__ the winter is very rainy , i don't like the rainy day . __eou__ what about the weather in boston ? __eou__ i lived there for three years . i like summer but i don't like winter . __eou__ is it very cold in winter ? __eou__ yes , it is.but it's nice in spring and fall .

hi , i haven't seen you in a while . __eou__ yes , it has been a long time ! __eou__ how long has it been since we last saw each other ? __eou__ i think that we last saw each other two years ago . __eou__ what have you been doing for the past two years ? __eou__ i have been going to graduate school at usc . __eou__ what are you majoring in ? __eou__ i am studying international communications . __eou__ you should easily be able to find a job with that major . __eou__ i am counting on being able to get a good job .

it's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , the weather sure is nice today . __eou__ i love it when the weather is like this.why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? __eou__ that sounds like a good idea.the sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . __eou__ i really miss the change of seasons like we have in colorado ; but i must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . __eou__ hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . __eou__ okay.hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? do you think it will rain after all ? __eou__ i don't think so . i say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . __eou__ if the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.it ' s been a while since i've not really gotten some sun .

i told you that she is no fool . __eou__ i know she is quite an article , but i was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . __eou__ she cannot get in dutch with him . he is her boss , you know . __eou__ but most bosses are fools for woman .

isn't it wonderful walking here ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . __eou__ yes , look over there . that's the empire state building . my book says it's 102 stories tall . __eou__ it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? __eou__ you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__ what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue ? __eou__ quite a number . actually every skyscraper has a history . a few blocks ahead we'll see st.patrick ' s cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed rockefeller center . it's a landmark in the history of architecture . __eou__ what's there after that ? __eou__ well then , there's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . __eou__ what are they all for ? __eou__ most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the world . and there are lots of very expensive places .
they promised us a sea view . __eou__ well , you can just see the sea . between the factory chimneys . __eou__ isn't it awful ? i can't bear to look at it . i don't think i can stand this place for two weeks . __eou__ well , it can't be helped . we'll just have to put up with it .

you're from new york , aren't you ? __eou__ yes , that's right . __eou__ what do you suggest i should see in new york ? __eou__ well , how about the museum of modern art ? __eou__ no , i don't like museums.they ' re boring . __eou__ why don't you go to see the empire state building ? __eou__ ah ! that sounds interesting .
you're not looking happy.what ' s the matter ? __eou__ oh , nothing special . i'm just a bit tired . __eou__ with the job ? __eou__ with everything , with everybody , with all this ! __eou__ a good suggestion for you.you need a holiday . __eou__ it wasn't always like this , you know . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ well , i mean.we always do the same thing.there ' s no variety in our lives . __eou__ you need a holiday.that ' s what's the matter . __eou__ certainly , perhaps .
hello , pam . __eou__ i'm glad that you can make it . __eou__ it looks like there are a lot of people inside . __eou__ yeah . i've invited a lot of friends besides you . __eou__ should i take my shoes off ? __eou__ we all keep our shoes on indoors . __eou__ where are your parents ? __eou__ they've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves . __eou__ that's great !
we still have one more day to go before we return home . what will we see tomorrow ? __eou__ no idea . we've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . what else is there to see ? __eou__ what about a factory tour ? __eou__ you mean visit a factory ? __eou__ yes . i heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . we can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__ good idea ! i've always been interested in that . how much is the entrance fee ? __eou__ i'm not sure , but as far as i know , most factory tours are free . they are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__ really ? what do the companies do that for ? __eou__ i believe most of them think it as good public relations . they can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__ oh , isee . so factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__ exactly . __eou__ do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__ i'll call the tourist information centre to check .
don't just stand outside . come on in . __eou__ yeah . __eou__ this is alex . remember ? this is sean . __eou__ nice to meet you guys . __eou__ over there are stacy and rebecca . we're all on the school's tennis team . __eou__ who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? __eou__ that's my boyfriend matt . isn't he cute ? __eou__ he sure is ! __eou__ come on . i'll introduce you two .
it's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ yeah , and most excitingly , i met the girl living under me today . she's really nice . __eou__ is she american ? __eou__ yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! man , i could tell from the moment i saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! __eou__ so i take it you two are hitting it off ? i know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? __eou__ i don't know . i am not really worried about that . i don't wanna lose before even starting . besides i think the other two american guys have also fallen for her . __eou__ sounds like you've got some competition . you made a move already ? __eou__ not yet . but i am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . i know some good restaurants nearby . __eou__ that's nice . having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? __eou__ you bet . now that you mentioned it , i think i'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . __eou__ good luck ! __eou__ thanks !
hi , larry , how was your weekend ? __eou__ not bad . we had a get-together with friends from college . i haven't seen many of them since graduation . how about you ? __eou__ great . i hung out with jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . __eou__ sounds a good weekend . you know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and jo can become such close friends . __eou__ yeah , i never thought we could be good friends either . we have our differences . she's more outgoing and active while i am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . we can talk for hours about anything . __eou__ that's great . i know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes . __eou__ when jo and i are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . besides , i know she will always be there for me when i need her , and she knows i'll be there for her . __eou__ it seems you two bring out the best of one another . __eou__ exactly . having jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me . __eou__ yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . __eou__ thanks , i think so too .
hey , mary , what's up ? __eou__ not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ oh , that's exciting . what's this guy like ? is he hot ? __eou__ well , i ddin't think so at first . but as we started talking , i found him extremely funny and witty . i couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love chinese food ! i have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . __eou__ it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ there's nothing definite i think . i don't have a list or anything , but when i first meet somebody , i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have a radar helping me spot new friends . __eou__ well , that's something i've never heard of . but if you ask me what i value most in a friend , i would have to say honesty . __eou__ i agree . you can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ yeah , i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i don't need fair-weather friends either .
good news ! __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ the state of economy is starting to go up in our country . __eou__ that ’ s just the short in the arm we need .
i've heard you're going to america tomorrow . i want to see you off at the airport . __eou__ oh , thanks a lot . __eou__ what time are you leaving ? __eou__ 1:30 p . m . but i've got to check in at 12:30 p . m . __eou__ what airline and what flight ? __eou__ pan american airlines . flight 282 . __eou__ i'll see you at the airport at 12:30 p . m . __eou__ ok . see you tomorrow .
i cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . __eou__ why do you say so ? __eou__ because he is often in trouble . __eou__ she has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . __eou__ oh , i see .
hi , michael , how's it going ? __eou__ well , things are all right . __eou__ i heard you got a new roommate . what's he like ? __eou__ yeah , bob moved in last week . he is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend . __eou__ oh ? what's wrong with his girlfriend ? __eou__ she came over last weekend . she is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . i tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all i could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " __eou__ well , i guess it might take some time to get used to . __eou__ i doubt it . last time was an oral train wreck . listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . __eou__ oh come on , it's not that bad . __eou__ no , it's so much worse . and tonight they invited me out to dinner . i really have no idea how i'm going to pull it off . __eou__ rough . maybe you can do the most of the talking . __eou__ that's the plan . __eou__ good luck .
i often recalled the days when tom and i were madly in love . __eou__ very romantic ? __eou__ yeah . he always tickled my finny bone with his college stories . __eou__ you married him for that reason ? __eou__ definitely not . the most important thing was we loved each other .
jessica is going back to holland next week . i've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but i still have no clue . __eou__ is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ yeah , that's her . we had a lot of wonderful times together . she is really a special friend , and i want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ i am not good at picking gifts . maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ i don't think so . that way it would lose all the charm . i want it to be a surprise . i want to show her that i care about her and i hope our friendship will last . __eou__ yeah , that's nice . __eou__ hmm , i think i've got an idea . maybe i can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ a plant ? that's creative . i'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . but there is a problem . do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? __eou__ i hope so . i'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . i hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ i don't know . i think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . you don't want to get her in trouble .
do you feel better ? __eou__ much better . my heart sank when mary told me that she wanted to leave me . __eou__ don ’ t be sad . everything will be fine . __eou__ thanks a lot . you are so kind .
it is too bad today . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ my som was lost . i told him to stand rooted to the spot when i went shopping , but he ignored it . __eou__ how did you find him at last ? __eou__ it was the police wo helped me to do that . __eou__ it must have taught you a lesson this time .
did you get the car you wanted ? __eou__ no . someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . __eou__ what about the car over there ? __eou__ it is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well .
today is the old couple ’ s golden wedding . __eou__ that must be a long love story . __eou__ yeah . they promised to stick together forever when they were young . __eou__ they have made it . will our love last 50 years ? __eou__ i don ’ t know .
tim ’ s smiles are interesting . __eou__ yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . __eou__ you are right . they sweep nancy off her feet . and now she fell head over heels in love with him . __eou__ how wonderful it would be if i had such smiles !
what's this , i wonder ? __eou__ i'm not sure.let me have a look ... it could be a coffee grinder . __eou__ a coffee grinder ? __eou__ yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . __eou__ oh , that would be very useful .
what do you think of smoking ? __eou__ it ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . __eou__ what in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? __eou__ stop producing cigarettes . __eou__ but that ’ ll affect the national economy . __eou__ that ’ s right . but i don ’ t think there are better ways . __eou__ how about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? __eou__ maybe it can take effect .
do you think the weather will be good this weekend ? __eou__ i heard it might rain . __eou__ oh . that ’ s a pity . i thought that we might go hiking in the hills . __eou__ mmm ... well we could go to that new art gallery instead . __eou__ yes that might be a better idea . __eou__ maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too . __eou__ ok - let ’ s do that then !
excuse me . is anyone sitting here ? __eou__ no , nobody . __eou__ you don ’ t mind if i smoke , do you ? __eou__ well , to be frank , yes , i do . __eou__ oh , i ’ m sorry . but this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? i mean would you mind if i smoke here ? __eou__ actually it is . perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . __eou__ sign ? what ’ s sign ? __eou__ there , on the window . __eou__ oh , sorry . i didn ’ t notice it . sorry . __eou__ that ’ s all right .
are you a smoker ? __eou__ yes , i ’ m afraid i am . my husband is a smoker too . __eou__ would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? __eou__ no . but my husband smokes 20 or more a day . __eou__ when did you begin to smoke ? __eou__ i had my first cigarette when i was 17 . __eou__ might i ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? __eou__ yes . twice .
are you feeling better today , bill ? __eou__ well , it ’ s hard to say . i coughed a lot in the evening . __eou__ you ’ d better give up smoking . it ’ s bad for your health . __eou__ you ’ re right . but you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . __eou__ but you should make up your mind first . __eou__ you know i often have to work far into the night . i need smoking to keep me awake . __eou__ why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? you ’ ll have the same time for work . __eou__ thank you for your advice . i ’ ll try it .
did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? the person who wrote that must be crazy . __eou__ i don ’ t think so . i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . __eou__ maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good . __eou__ no , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
hey , where's cindy ? __eou__ she told me that she's got tennis practice today . __eou__ you're mary , right ? __eou__ how did you know ? __eou__ cindy told me about you in our gym class . __eou__ i see . do you live in this neighborhood , too ? __eou__ my house is next door to yours . __eou__ oh , cindy did mention you before . you're alexander newman . __eou__ just call me alex . alex and alexander are the same thing .
i'm afraid i've had a terrible row with my boss . what shall i do ? __eou__ i think you'd better apologize . __eou__ oh , but i can't . it wasn't my fault . __eou__ maybe not , but i advice you to say it was your fault .
we used to be very friendly , but it seems now that my daughter ’ s marriage has taken its toll of our relationship . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him . __eou__ she is a grow-up . she can make her own decision . __eou__ i wish she wouldn ’ t regret for her decision .
well , everything is packed and ready to go . __eou__ it's hard to believe that we're really leaving . the past two weeks was like a dream . __eou__ yes . just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - __eou__ and the people were so friendly ! __eou__ yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . __eou__ do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? __eou__ of course . that was the best pasta i've ever had . __eou__ i ate so much that i wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . __eou__ if only we could eat there once more ! __eou__ maybe we can come here again next summer . __eou__ hope the restaurant is still there . __eou__ hey , what's the time ? __eou__ oh , my god ! only two hours left before the plane takes off . we need to be at the airport now . __eou__ don't worry . we can call a cab . it'll be alright .
are you feeling better today , bill ? __eou__ well , it's hard to say . i cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ you'd better give up smoking . it's bad for your health . __eou__ you're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ but you should make up your mind first . __eou__ you know , i often have to work till late at night . i need something to keep me awake . __eou__ why don't you go to bed and get up early ? you'll have the same time for work . __eou__ thank you for your advice ! i'll try it .

now darling , i know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . i think we should sell it . __eou__ oh , no , nathan , i ... i really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . market prices are going to go up , and i think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . __eou__ but we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . i think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . __eou__ but don't you like this place ? i remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . __eou__ well , only you liked it really , darling . __eou__ oh , why didn't you say so then ? but i still think we've made a good buy .
i feel very miserable . i took the death of my wife very hard , you know . __eou__ cheer up ! let bygones be bygones . __eou__ i ’ ve tried it , not a chance . __eou__ it seems you have to take time .
do you like traveling , kathy ? __eou__ i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ exactly .
guess who i saw just now ? __eou__ who ? __eou__ john smith , the escaped criminal . __eou__ that bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . __eou__ i think i must report to the cops . __eou__ ok .
cindy , i have this room to myself ? __eou__ it's all yours . __eou__ it's twice as big as my room in taiwan ! __eou__ well , i hope it's comfortable enough for you . __eou__ i think i'm going to like it here . __eou__ you have a phone on the bedside table that you can use . __eou__ wow , i have my own bathroom ! __eou__ kind of . it leads to my bedroom . __eou__ we share the same bathroom , in other words .
matthew ? hi ! __eou__ steve ! haven't seen you in ages ! how long's it been ? __eou__ it's got to be almost a year now . __eou__ how have you been ? __eou__ i'm pretty good . i've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i don't want to renew it . __eou__ yeah , i remember the neighborhood . have you found a place yet ? __eou__ not yet . but i am still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck . __eou__ well , maybe i can help . remember my neighbor ? __eou__ mrs . thou ? __eou__ yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . i think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . __eou__ great . it's a lovely neighborhood . and it would be nice to be neighbors again . it would be just like the old days ! __eou__ i'll ask mrs . thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . has your number changed ?
why are you walking to and fro in the room ? __eou__ i ’ m worrying about the children . after all this is the first time they have been out without us . __eou__ don ’ t worry . they are grown-ups . __eou__ i know . but i couldn ’ t help .
what happened to nancy ? she is all sweetness and light today . __eou__ she is going to get married . __eou__ no wonder ! who is the bridegroom ? __eou__ i don ’ t know .
what is wrong with peter ? he sure looks unhappy . __eou__ his girlfriend dumped him , and he is tearing his heart out over her . __eou__ how foolish he is . the girl is inviting . she often makes a pass at boys . __eou__ love is blind , you know .
lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . __eou__ she must be a good wife . __eou__ not necessarily . this is only what she says , not what she does . __eou__ i see .
i'm going to try sky diving this weekend . __eou__ i wouldn't do it if i were you . __eou__ it's sounds like fun . __eou__ it's very dangerous , you know . __eou__ i want to try something exciting . __eou__ it's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . __eou__ i'll tell you all about it next monday . __eou__ well , take care of yourself , and don't say i didn't warn you .
i couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them . __eou__ what was wrong ? __eou__ you carried it too far . you obviously offended someone . __eou__ i didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone . __eou__ i know , i know . but someone took offence .
so alex , you ’ re off to the olympic stadium then ? __eou__ yes , i should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . __eou__ wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . __eou__ yes , i ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . __eou__ well have a good time . get me some autographs if you can . __eou__ ok , i ’ ll try my best .
what shall we do after the volleyball match ? __eou__ how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym . __eou__ that's a good idea . i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . __eou__ me , too . what did you have in mind ? __eou__ i haven't decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must . __eou__ i agree . they're very lovely , especially huanhuan __eou__ is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ? __eou__ the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive . __eou__ oh , i see . if i buy more than a set , can i get any discount ? __eou__ i don't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now . __eou__ any other ideas ? __eou__ there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . __eou__ it all sounds great . we can go there after the match . i can't wait to see what they have .
how ’ s your trip going ? __eou__ oh i ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here __eou__ isn ’ t london hot in the summer ? __eou__ well it can be but shanghai is much warmer than london . __eou__ i see . what about transport ? how does shanghai compare to london ? __eou__ actually i think the buses and trains here are more modern . __eou__ and what about the number of people on the streets ? __eou__ oh , i think shanghai is much more crowded than london .
cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time tv shows are comedies ? __eou__ that's because americans love sitcoms . __eou__ sitcoms ? __eou__ situation comedies . a sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . if there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . __eou__ in taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . __eou__ i think americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
have you been to shanghai before ? __eou__ yes i have . i ’ ve been there three times in the past year . __eou__ that sounds great . have you been to the top of the pearl tower ? __eou__ no i haven ’ t . i haven ’ t visited the bund either . i ’ ve always had too much work to do . __eou__ so you haven ’ t done much then , in shanghai ? __eou__ actually , i ’ ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on nanjing lu . they were delicious !
hello martin . have you been to any events yet ? __eou__ yes i have . i went to the table tennis yesterday . __eou__ oh wow . how was it ? __eou__ oh . it was great . i love ma lin . he ’ s my favourite table tennis player . have you seen anything yet ? __eou__ oh i still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . i ’ d love to see something though . __eou__ well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! we can just stand by the side of the road . __eou__ what a great idea .
what happened to you yesterday ? __eou__ oh i fell over on the way to work . __eou__ oh i see . so that ’ s why you didn ’ t come in ? __eou__ yes and i broke my phone too so i couldn ’ t call you . __eou__ oh dear , that sounds terrible . __eou__ it was ! but the worst thing was i tore my best shirt . __eou__ oh dear . well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future .
oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . __eou__ thank you . my husband gave it to me . __eou__ oh i didn ’ t know you were married . __eou__ yes i am . i got married five years ago . __eou__ oh i see . that ’ s nice . did you meet your husband at work ? __eou__ no , we met at university .
oh you look awful ! what ’ s the matter ? __eou__ oh ! i feel really under the weather . i ’ ve got a sore throat and a bad cough . __eou__ oh dear . maybe you ’ ve caught a cold . __eou__ yes , i ’ ve had lots of overtime to do recently and i haven ’ t slept much at all . __eou__ well then , you should get some rest this weekend and don ’ t go out drinking . __eou__ yes , i think you ’ re right !
how did you meet your boyfriend , cindy ? __eou__ we were in the same science class last term . __eou__ who made the first move ? __eou__ i did . __eou__ wow ! __eou__ it was no big deal . __eou__ what do your parents think of your dating a boy ? __eou__ they're glad that i finally got a boyfriend . __eou__ they're glad ? !
is jack still staying idle everyday ? __eou__ no , he has mended his way . after his father died , he set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order . __eou__ really ? he is so competent now . __eou__ you can ’ t imagine what he is like now .
mandy , would you like to come for dinner tonight ? __eou__ dinner ? where ? __eou__ at the new five spices restaurant in chaoyang . __eou__ what kind of food do they serve ? __eou__ it ’ s asian fusion . i heard it ’ s delicious . __eou__ oh really ! that sounds lovely .
why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? __eou__ well , brad from school asked me out just today . __eou__ brad bush ? good for you ! __eou__ but i don't know what to do . __eou__ you mean you've never had a boyfriend ? __eou__ my mom says no boyfriend until i'm in college . __eou__ until college ? __eou__ actually , that's what a lot of parents in taiwan say to their kids .
i heard that you're going on your first date friday night . __eou__ are you angry , lisa ? __eou__ angry ? why would i be ? __eou__ please don't tell my mom . __eou__ come on . dating is a part of young people's social life . besides , you're sixteen already . __eou__ i'm glad that you see it that way . __eou__ do you want to borrow my coat ? i have a black coat that would look smashing on you . __eou__ thank you so much , lisa !
what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ i think i'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ oh , i don't think you're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ well . yes , but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i'm not as shy as i think . anyway , you're certainly not shy ! __eou__ you're right . i love going out and making new friends . __eou__ so , you'll be at my birthday party on friday ? __eou__ of course !
why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? __eou__ well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . __eou__ what are they ? __eou__ one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . __eou__ why ? __eou__ the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . __eou__ that makes sense . probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . __eou__ and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . there is one final reason why so many people are fat . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! the average american home has the tv on for 6 hours a day ! __eou__ wow ! no wonder people are so fat . say , carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . __eou__ yeah , i guess so . __eou__ you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . __eou__ hey , i started a diet and lost 10 pounds . __eou__ so what happened ? __eou__ well , i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . __eou__ you should have kept trying .
why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ? __eou__ that sounds good but i don ’ t know what ’ s on . __eou__ i think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring hugh grant . let ’ s go and see that . __eou__ ok , that ’ s a good idea . where shall we meet ? __eou__ well how about meeting at my place ? __eou__ that sounds good . i ’ ll call you once i arrive .
so do you think you can get to the office alone ? __eou__ sure , i ’ ll catch the train . if i can ’ t catch the train , i ’ ll get a taxi . __eou__ do you think the taxi driver will understand you ? __eou__ if he doesn ’ t understand me , i ’ ll show him the office address on my business card . __eou__ ok but how will we know if you are going to be late ? __eou__ i ’ ll call you if i ’ m delayed .
what's your favorite book ? __eou__ it's gone with the wind . __eou__ why do you like it best ? __eou__ i enjoy the various characters and the plot . __eou__ well . i like the thorn birds best . __eou__ is it very interesting ? __eou__ sure . i like the writer's language , too . __eou__ if i have a chance , i'll enjoy the book . __eou__ would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? __eou__ that's a good idea . let's go !
what's that book you have under your arm ? __eou__ it's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . __eou__ how in the world did you get a copy ? i've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i'm still waiting my turn . __eou__ i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day . __eou__ is it really worth paying for ? __eou__ i can't tell yet . i haven't got beyond the first chapter . __eou__ if it's any good , i'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
i am exhausted . i need some sleep . __eou__ didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? __eou__ i twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . i was worried about my mother ’ s health . __eou__ don ’ t worry . it ’ s only a cold .
mr.ben , what do you think of the book ? __eou__ it's an excellent one . i like it very much . __eou__ why ? __eou__ it includes a lot of useful words and phrases . __eou__ i agree with you .

i like football best of all . __eou__ do you ? __eou__ it's a very good game . __eou__ do you watch it or do you still play it ? __eou__ i only watch now .
every country should face the history . __eou__ yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . we have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__ sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . __eou__ but there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__ i believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming .
did you have a good weekend ? __eou__ well i wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much . __eou__ oh i see . so what did you do then ? __eou__ i washed my car instead . __eou__ ahh . and how about on sunday ? did you watch the football ? __eou__ no i didn ’ t . i worked in the morning then i played tennis with my husband .
how was mei ’ s party on saturday ? __eou__ oh i didn ’ t go . i stayed at home with my family . __eou__ oh really ? what did you do ? __eou__ we watched lots of television and films . __eou__ i see . anything else ? __eou__ yes , we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine . __eou__ well , it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself .
what ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ i ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ? __eou__ about 70 , i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ did she ? that ’ s great . however , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ how ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ oh , he ’ s fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ he ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ i had mine when i was 24 . that ’ s a little young . i ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ yes , i think you ’ re right . i ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ yes , there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ it ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict , kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient , they might go wild .
how ’ s your father ? __eou__ he ’ s fine . he retired last week . it ’ s turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__ he can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__ oh , i don ’ t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__ so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea ! __eou__ how do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__ in the same way , probably .
how long have you been in england ? __eou__ for almost two years . __eou__ almost two years ? your english is very good . __eou__ thank you . but there's still a lot for me to learn .
lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ oh , yes . beautiful . __eou__ you are not english , are you ? __eou__ no , i am from france .
i don't think we've met . __eou__ no , i don't think we have . __eou__ my name is dick brown . __eou__ how do you do ? mr . brown . i am susan heywood . __eou__ mr . smith often talked about you . __eou__ really ? i am glad to meet you . __eou__ i'm honored to know you .
can you tell me a little about paris ? __eou__ sure . what do you expect to know ? __eou__ i want to see some of the famous places like eiffel tower , the seine river ... __eou__ and you shouldn't miss the louvre museum . you can stay there for at least a whole day . __eou__ that's a good idea . i almost forget it.what else ? __eou__ the night life there . it's so romantic ! __eou__ oh , wonderful ! how is the weather ? __eou__ i went there in august , and it was hot . but i was told autumn is the best season . __eou__ sounds exciting . i can't wait .
what are you doing this weekend ? __eou__ nothing much . i ’ m going to the cinema on friday night but that ’ s all i have planned . __eou__ so you ’ re free on saturday night ? __eou__ that ’ s right . __eou__ would you like to have dinner with me ? __eou__ oh , that would be lovely . shall we say seven o ’ clock ? __eou__ perfect . i ’ ll pick you up then .
have you ever been to britain ? __eou__ oh yes , i ’ ve been to britain many times . i go there on business . __eou__ really ? how often do you go there ? __eou__ usually , i go to london twice a year but sometimes i go three or four times a year . __eou__ do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday ? __eou__ i ’ m afraid i never go for a holiday . it ’ s always business .
what a good day ! __eou__ yes . it's really wonderful here the grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city . __eou__ right . let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery . __eou__ great , let's go . __eou__ wow , what a beautiful lake ! the green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery . __eou__ en , it's so beautiful that i don't want to move my eyes from it . __eou__ i feel as if i'm living in a different world , honey . __eou__ the same to me . all the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ... __eou__ i think we should go out more frequently . the natural scenery can do us good . __eou__ that's the point . we should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time . __eou__ right . the city life has made us tired and out of energy , while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings .
are you free this evening , li ? __eou__ i ’ m afraid i ’ m busy tonight . i ’ m having dinner with friends . __eou__ what a pity . i wanted to go for a drink with you . __eou__ what about tomorrow ? are you doing anything tomorrow ? __eou__ no , i haven ’ t got any plans . __eou__ shall we go out tomorrow then ? __eou__ why not ? sounds good to me .
so john , have you ever been to china before ? __eou__ no , i haven ’ t . this is the first time i have been to china . __eou__ have you travelled to many other countries ? __eou__ to be honest , i have never been to an asian country before but i have visited many countries in europe . __eou__ what about america ? have you ever been to the united states ? __eou__ actually , i haven ’ t been to the states but i have been to canada .
hi colin . how are you feeling today ? __eou__ oh , i feel ok but i ’ m still very tired . __eou__ it's probably jet lag . __eou__ i think so . one minute i feel quite awake , and the next i feel very tired . __eou__ do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? __eou__ oh yes , i'm very interested in chinese history so i ’ d like to visit the summer palace . __eou__ good idea . i ’ d be very happy to go there .
hi amy , you look very happy . __eou__ yes , i'm very pleased . i've just got two tickets to see the olympic opening ceremony . __eou__ wow . you must be very excited . __eou__ i certainly am . i would have been very disappointed if i hadn ’ t got them . __eou__ shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? __eou__ what a good idea . i'm quite hungry . __eou__ me too . i feel very thirsty as well . __eou__ let ’ s go then .
susan , good evening . why are you so dressed up ? __eou__ i am on my way out to a new year ’ s banquet . how do i look ? is my make-up ok ? __eou__ you look great . your make-up is perfect . __eou__ do you think i should wear a different dress ? __eou__ no , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . __eou__ thanks for saying . do you have any ideas which necklace i should wear ? __eou__ with that dress i'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect . __eou__ thanks for helping out . now that i ’ m ready , what are you doing tonight ? __eou__ not much , just a house party with some friends . __eou__ sounds fun . anyone i know ? __eou__ yeah , most of the people are from our office . __eou__ sounds like i'm missing out on a good time . oh , well , there is always next year . __eou__ i ’ m sure you ’ ll have fun no matter where you go . remember to take your bag .
tomorrow i'll take you to some places that i'm sure you will have interest in . __eou__ where else haven't we been to yet ? __eou__ they are the folk antique handicrafts and collectibles exhibition halls . __eou__ sounds great ! how many kinds of folk collections do they have ? __eou__ well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . that's half the collections of antique objects in china . there's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors . __eou__ private collectors ! they must have excellent collections . i'ii go and see each of them . what kinds of collections can i see ? come on , don't keep me in suspense ! __eou__ no hurry ! i'ii tell you now , the collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini-musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ... __eou__ enough ! i can't wait anymore .
the dinner was really good . it knocked my socks off . __eou__ that's very kind of you to say so . let's try some after-dinner wines . __eou__ great . sweet wines are my favorite . they always make a great finish to a decisions meal . __eou__ do you prefer brandy or ports . __eou__ port , please . __eou__ excellent choice . i love its smooth flavor . __eou__ the port is quite exquisite . it must have spent years aging in barrels . am i right ? __eou__ yes . you always have a good nose for wines . __eou__ next time we are about to dinner we should try some canadian ice wine . __eou__ oh , what's that ? __eou__ it's made from naturally frozen grapes . __eou__ why not ? it sounds great . __eou__ ok , here's to your health . __eou__ thanks . cheers . __eou__ cheers .

the bartender just gave the last call . let's order another round , okay ? __eou__ sure , but let's get a pitcher this time we should be able to down it before they close . __eou__ that sounds good . you order the beer while i go to the bathroom . where is the can in this place ? __eou__ it's all the way to the back . see that yellow door ? __eou__ yeah . i think i can find it . __eou__ you're back already . that sure was quick . __eou__ that's because i just took one step inside and turned right around . that bathroom is too gross for me . __eou__ well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . anyway . he said it was too close to closing time . __eou__ let's leave then . i could take some fresh air , anyway . __eou__ okay , let's go !
what's beijing like ? __eou__ it ’ s big and exciting but noisy . __eou__ what can i see in beijing ? __eou__ you can see the forbidden city . __eou__ what ’ s it like ? __eou__ it ’ s beautiful but crowded .

hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ everything's great . and you ? __eou__ same here.have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ no , i haven't had a chance to . but i have been watching a chinese tv scries called " chinese-style divorce " . __eou__ oh . really ? i saw it two years ago . it's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ yeah . i found it is so close to our life . __eou__ it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ you said it . you know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year . __eou__ well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too . __eou__ i know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ that's true . it's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation . __eou__ ii can't agree more . the only-child-generation in china tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ definitely.they don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ i think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage .
hello , deva , how are you ? __eou__ can't complain . what about you ? __eou__ not bad . have you heard wendy divorced her husband ? __eou__ i've heard . she looks quite depressed . __eou__ yes . they used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ i heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ yeah . mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ you said it . you know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ yeah . we chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ definitely . that's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ we've heard so much about chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ that's true.just hope wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon .
i haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him . __eou__ why don't you find someone who is in the know . __eou__ i'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , i don't know who is well in the know . __eou__ did you ask his former secretary , lora ? she knows a lot about him . __eou__ thanks for reminding me . she's the right person to help me .
