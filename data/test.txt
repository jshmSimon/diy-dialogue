i saw an interesting program on tv last night . it was about elderly people . __eou__ and what did the program say ? __eou__ it said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ i think that many physicians now agree with that idea . __eou__ and the tv program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . my father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day .
hey , jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? __eou__ umm ... i think so . what's up ? __eou__ i've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like i'm going to need to make a claim . __eou__ really ? are you ok ? __eou__ i have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? __eou__ if the injury is workplace related i'm sure it's completely covered . __eou__ hummum ... i think i'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.anyway ... now that i'm going to have to make some claims , i think i'd better try and understand how the system works . would you mind breaking it down for me ? __eou__ sure . basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . the company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . __eou__ that's the charge for insurance i see on my pay slip each month , right ? __eou__ yep . every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . __eou__ so workman's compensation is if i slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? __eou__ that's right . the company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating .
so , fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ well , i've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ that's cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ i ’ m planning on living with my parents . won't you ? __eou__ i couldn't even if i wanted to . my parents told me that if i went home , then i'd have to find my own place . __eou__ you mean they're kicking you out ? __eou__ not really , they just don't want me living at home . my older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it's ok if i move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ my parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . they think that it's important that i should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ i know i need to learn that myself , but i just don't have the money for it at the moment . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
so chris , i've heard that you're from a big family . how many people ? __eou__ nine total . seven children and my parents . __eou__ seven children ? that's a lot . why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . my father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ jeez , seven children . that must have a lot of problems . we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ it can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ like what ? i assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ that's one . another is the lack of personal property . everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . especially clothes . three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ and the age gap is also annoying . there's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . we have nothing in common . __eou__ same problem here . there's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . the last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__ well , at least going to college won't be too bad . since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . __eou__ they do , but it doesn't help too much . having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight .
darling , i have news for you . bobby and his wife , evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . __eou__ really ? i thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . __eou__ actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . __eou__ oh , what a coincidence ! i bet bobby must be very happy about it . he likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ in fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is american and the other one is chinese . __eou__ oh , right . now i know why they would want to see our boy . it ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ it ’ s still a mystery . because evelyn is only three-month pregnant . but she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ oh ! you mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? it ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ?
do you have much experience with kids ? __eou__ yes . i have three sons . actually i also have a grandson . __eou__ to tell you the truth , sometimes i regret having a baby so early . i have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . __eou__ i understand . i was in your position before . at that time i couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . my husband seldom stayed at home . __eou__ what about your mother ? did she help you ? __eou__ yes , she did a little . but you see , americans are different from chinese . you can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . she could baby-sit only once or twice a week . that ’ s it . i had to care for them most of the time . __eou__ i see . so if my little family goes to america , i would end up taking care of my child all the time . my husband would have to make the bread for us . i just don ’ t know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day . __eou__ don ’ t worry . you can take night classes . i did that when i had kids . and soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . then you could find a job and work . __eou__ sounds not so easy to me . when that happens , i will be too old to learn . __eou__ no . you see , i went back to school to get my master ’ s degree when i was in my thirties . you won ’ t be older than that .
hi , anna . i haven ’ t seen you for ages . where have you been ? __eou__ i ’ ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ no wonder i haven ’ t seen you recently . where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ i went with my husband . our first stop was bangkok . we stayed there for 5 days . then we flew to hong kong , stopover for 3 days . our last stop was china . we visited the great wall . __eou__ you must have a wonderful time . __eou__ yes . we enjoyed ourselves very much . have you traveled much , luke ? __eou__ no , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . we haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . the first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . we spent our honeymoon in the alps . __eou__ oh , i see . yeah . some people like traveling , some don ’ t . my husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . he said what ’ s the use of traveling ? a waste of money and a waste of time.at last i got him on the move . after all , he loved me . we went to bali , indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . that trip left a very deep impression on him . since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ?
how good are you at sports , bill ? __eou__ are you kidding ? i ’ m terrible ! but i love to watch sports . i go to football or baseball games a lot . and i read sports magazines every week . __eou__ wow ! __eou__ do you like sports , janice ? __eou__ oh , yes . i like to exercise . but i don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . i don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ oh , i see . you know , we spend time doing different sports . how much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ well , i guess i exercise about two hours a day . i do aerobics three times a week , and the other days i play badminton with my husband . i always feel good afterward . __eou__ that ’ s great ! i ’ ve heard people say that before . __eou__ well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? it ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ oh , i ’ m too lazy to play sports , and i ’ m not good at anything either . it hardly excites me .
i can ’ t wait to retire . __eou__ and then what ? __eou__ and then i ’ m moving to florida where i can play golf all day , every day ! __eou__ that sounds boring to me . __eou__ what do you plan on doing after you retire ? __eou__ yes , i think i will do something new . i ’ ve always wanted to be a teacher . __eou__ i admire your energy , ruth . you are young at heart .
hey , ben ... did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ uh ... what game ? __eou__ baltimore defeated texas by 17 points ! __eou__ um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? __eou__ football of course ! __eou__ oh ... football . football is cool . i usually try to catch the world cup finals . __eou__ no , i'm talking about american football . the world cup is soccer . __eou__ oh , i understand . i can't say i'm a big fan . i'm from china , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . __eou__ so chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? __eou__ yes , i think so . but to be perfectly honest , i'm not really a sports nut.when i was in high school i played on the school volleyball team . are you a diehard football fan ? __eou__ oh , certainly . i wouldn't miss a game for the world . my girlfriend says i have an addiction . and actually , if i had to choose between her and my games ... i'd probably pick football . __eou__ it seems americans are very passionate about sports . is this just a part of your culture ? __eou__ oh , yeah ! i think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . americans come from many different backgrounds so i guess sports are something we can all enjoy together .
i don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . it seems like you ’ ve got good news everyday . __eou__ really ? do i look happy all the time ? __eou__ all i know is you look quite differently from other teachers . __eou__ oh , do you know why ? actually , it ’ s easy . because i always exercise . my exercise , i think , is very hard . i often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . i feel alive ! __eou__ oh , i know . i saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you . __eou__ yeah , they are doing it for fun . seldom would people like my exercise . it ’ s difficult and boring . __eou__ it ’ s true . many students do the exercise when they have to . we have p . e . once a week . __eou__ but i think chinese students need to exercise more . besides exercise will help them learn new things better . don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? __eou__ of course . i didn ’ t know that . i only know exercise makes bodies stronger . i should take some exercise then . do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ well , do what you like to do . it can be anything . jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . absolutely anything . doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . but remember to do some stretches first . __eou__ oh , i know . thank you .
hi , mr . zhang . what ’ s wrong ? you don ’ t look so happy . how was your date ? __eou__ i was turned down again . it ’ s frustrating . i guess you ’ ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__ me ? i ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__ at least you know what american women generally like in a man . __eou__ believe it or not , i guess american women like a man in good shape , which chinese women may not care about so much . that ’ s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard . __eou__ american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . __eou__ no , that ’ s not true . i ’ ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often , i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he ’ s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants . __eou__ you know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise . __eou__ why don ’ t you try then ? even if it doesn ’ t help you find an american girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won ’ t lose anything by doing that .
hi , kate . __eou__ hi , don . what a surprise ! __eou__ yeah , i saw someone walking like you , but i wasn ’ t sure . we haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now . __eou__ have you noticed what has changed ? __eou__ oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ? __eou__ yes . i ’ m on a diet , but i ’ ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ’ ve lost twelve pounds . __eou__ wow ! that ’ s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know , old habits are hard to break . __eou__ what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i ’ m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday . __eou__ dance ? you only go dancing ? that ’ s not hard . i can do that . __eou__ sure . join my class next week .
hey , shirley ! want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! __eou__ wow ! sure ! __eou__ i must confess i have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . __eou__ oh ... that's ok ... as long as you're buying ! __eou__ i really want to pick your brain about something i've been thinking a lot about . __eou__ i'd love to help if i can . __eou__ well , as you know , i have a bachelor's degree in english literature and that's served me well so far , but i've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a doctorate ! __eou__ wow ! just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . __eou__ but you have a master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? __eou__ yeah , i'd have to say it has . but i'm still paying for it , you know . __eou__ i know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . call me crazy , but i've always wanted to have that phd at the end of my name . __eou__ well , getting a doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . can you afford that ? can you survive that ? __eou__ i certainly can't afford it , but i'm sure i could find some good student loans . __eou__ i think you need to separate the dream of having a phd from the reality of years of more schooling . it's not as romantic as you might think . __eou__ yeah ... i keep thinking about what i'll do with a master's or doctorate . i love language but i don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on shakespeare . __eou__ uh huh , that's for sure . you might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students .
hey claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . is something wrong ? __eou__ i've been really stressed . it's the end of the year and i've got so much stuff to do ! i feel like i'm drowning in work . __eou__ well , stress is a real thing . it's not an imaginary condition . __eou__ it's seriously affecting my life ! i can't sleep , i don't have much of an appetite and my husband says i've been kind of short tempered . other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am i so weak ? __eou__ you're not weak ... you're stressed out ! stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . __eou__ yeah , but i don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . my stress is just about silly paperwork ! __eou__ but you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! it's called the flight or fight response . each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . __eou__ so a deadline will cause that same reaction ? __eou__ it could . modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . they just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! __eou__ so the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ?
hey susan , what are you coming as this year ? __eou__ coming as ? __eou__ yeah ... for halloween ! we have a big office party tomorrow evening . there's a prize for best costume ! __eou__ um ... i have to confess , i haven't given it much thought . i'm from china and halloween really isn't celebrated there . __eou__ really ! you don't have some kind of chinese ghost festival ? __eou__ oh ... sure . we have an entire month ! in traditional chinese culture , ghost month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . __eou__ cool ! a whole month ! what do you do during that month ? __eou__ well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . __eou__ feed them ? __eou__ yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . __eou__ and then later everyone eats the food ? __eou__ yes ! how did you guess that ? __eou__ it makes sense , right ? who else is going to eat it ? __eou__ good point ! __eou__ but no dressing up like ghosts , right ? __eou__ no ! so ... is halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ?
i heard you are going to move . __eou__ yes , i found a better house near my office . i ’ m very satisfied with it . but i ’ m worrying . __eou__ what are you worried about ? __eou__ i ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . you know , i have a lot of stuff . __eou__ you can call a mover . __eou__ how much dose that cost ? __eou__ around 200 rib for a truck . __eou__ i think it ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ but think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . __eou__ that ’ s right . __eou__ i know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . i ’ ll leave you their phone number . __eou__ wonderful . __eou__ it ’ s 8357688 8 . __eou__ okay , thanks a lot . you did me a great favor just now . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
hey , look at the offer i got in my e-mail . it says that i can get rich quickly while working at home ! __eou__ do you also believe in santa claus and the tooth fairy ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i mean that you're gullible . you shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the internet . __eou__ but it seems like a good idea . all i have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . after that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . __eou__ sounds like a pyramid scheme . have you heard of those before ? __eou__ pyramid scheme ? what is that ? __eou__ it's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . the person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . __eou__ sounds good to me . the guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . __eou__ not exactly . the scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . __eou__ what happens then ? __eou__ nothing . the people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . they end up losing . that's why it's a scam . __eou__ i see . i guess i should be more careful about what i read , especially on the internet where you have no idea who anybody is .
hi amanda , how are you ? i've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . __eou__ we've missed you too . the office just isn't the same without you . how is your new job ? __eou__ it's great . i really get to focus on what i like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . however , i'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . __eou__ wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! __eou__ i know . it is a lot of money and i haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . at our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . __eou__ well , every department is different . you wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a grinch , right ? __eou__ what is that ? __eou__ a grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . you know - a party proper . __eou__ i definitely don't want to be that ! but , i still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . what should i do ?
who ’ s that ? __eou__ it ’ me . susan taylor __eou__ oh , please come in . nice to see you . __eou__ on , what ’ re you doing ? you look as busy as a bee . __eou__ yeah , i ’ m trying to decorate my house . __eou__ really , that ’ s cool . let me see what you ’ ve done . __eou__ but actually it ’ s not done yet . i ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp . __eou__ that ’ s all right . let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . how did you get that idea ? __eou__ it ’ s just a simple decorating . i just want to add my personality to my living space .
i hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . __eou__ that ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . __eou__ what kind of house is it ? __eou__ it ’ s a wonderful spanish style . __eou__ oh , i love the roof tiles on spanish style houses . __eou__ and it ’ s a bargaining . a house like this in river side costs double the price . __eou__ great , is it a two bedroom house ? __eou__ no , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . there ’ s a two-car garage . __eou__ that ’ s a nice area too . it ’ ll be a good investment for you . __eou__ yeas , when will you buy a house ? __eou__ not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . __eou__ right , congratulations . __eou__ thank you .
did you move into your new apartment ? __eou__ yes , but i ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . i haven ’ t put anything away yet . __eou__ don ’ t worry . it ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . __eou__ don ’ t say that . it looks like a dump now . i can ’ t stand it . __eou__ have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? __eou__ unfortunately , yes . __eou__ what do you mean by that ? __eou__ i took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . it took me 20 minutes . __eou__ yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . __eou__ i thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now i ’ m not sure . __eou__ is there a supermarket nearby ? __eou__ yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . __eou__ sounds like you better buy a bicycle . __eou__ that ’ s right , or i ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking .
can you believe the headlines ? __eou__ what are you reading ? __eou__ i'm reading about michael milliken , the bond king . __eou__ didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? he got arrested for that , didn't he ? __eou__ he got arrested all right . __eou__ if i remember , he got off with a light sentence . something like three years in a minimum-security prison . __eou__ yup , that's him . he made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__ i think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he's still a millionaire . __eou__ that's the kind of thing in america that gets me mad . some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__ i know . and some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . __eou__ yup , you got it . criminals in america do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves . __eou__ so what's michael milliken up to these days ? __eou__ he's giving lectures on business at colleges .
so , jack , do you believe in ghosts ? __eou__ no , not really . why do you ask ? __eou__ because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost . __eou__ you saw a ghost ? when ? __eou__ it was many years ago , when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night , and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... __eou__ so that's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ? __eou__ it was a big , green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... __eou__ so what did you do ? __eou__ i hid so that it couldn't see me . slowly it got closer and closer , until ... __eou__ until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ? __eou__ it moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs , i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
you have been here for how long ? four months now ? __eou__ yeah , about . __eou__ do you know chinese better now ? __eou__ oh , definitely . i remember , when i first arrived in guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ oh , yeah . many chinese like to bargain . it happens almost everywhere . __eou__ i mean , i understand that . but the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . my perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . the truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ a shouting match ? you ’ re so funny . you must be exaggerating . i don ’ t believe it . __eou__ i am not exaggerating at all . i ’ m telling you the truth . that was how i felt at that time . __eou__ yes , perhaps . chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ yes , absolutely true .
so do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ palmistry ? what is that ? __eou__ it's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future . __eou__ oh , you mean palm reading . i've seen that before , but i don't believe in it . __eou__ are you sure ? i've read a lot about palmistry and i've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ really ? you've read books about it ? ok , then . but only if you want to . __eou__ ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ? __eou__ hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ what ? what is it ? what's the matter ? __eou__ you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you're told .
ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ well , we have the thompsons , the greens , and the anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ don't forget my friend andy from the office . he has nothing to do on friday , so i invited him over . __eou__ but that makes thirteen people ! we can't have thirteen people for dinner on friday ! __eou__ why can't we ? __eou__ it's an old superstition . if we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . can andy bring a date ? __eou__ i'm not sure . he just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and i don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ but we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ i think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . it's only a superstition . it really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ absolutely not ! i refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on friday ! __eou__ ok , ok . i'll ask my sister to come . that way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ that's better .
thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . i was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . is that common ? __eou__ well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ it wasn't . it was birdseed . we don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ oh , i didn't think of that . well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in china . plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ wait until you see what happens next ! the bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . let's go over and watch . __eou__ she ’ s got quite a crowd around her . oh , look ! that little girl caught it ! __eou__ she ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . i guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time .
what a great weekend that was ! __eou__ my feelings exactly . __eou__ i really enjoy the beach in the summer . __eou__ i couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ we should come here more often . __eou__ you are absolutely right . __eou__ i'd like to come back next weekend . __eou__ that's exactly the way i feel .
have you heard about anlesen david ? __eou__ no , have they have another fight ? __eou__ no , they got engaged . __eou__ you must be joking.those two . __eou__ well , my dear . i didn't believe either.but got it straight form the horse's mouth.davi called me this morning . __eou__ so when did this happen ? __eou__ last weekend , while they were on the sik trip . __eou__ well , i believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ? __eou__ next june . __eou__ i can hardly believe it .
well , i can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__ john , they are old-fashioned people from the chinese countryside . that ’ s their custom . __eou__ i know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__ don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__ yes , but americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . __eou__ i think that maybe chinese families are closer than your families . __eou__ i think you ’ re right !
what's the matter , lisa ? you don't look too good . __eou__ i just found out that my husband is cheating on me . __eou__ you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy . __eou__ that's what i thought . it seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . __eou__ two months ? how did you find out ? __eou__ i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister , and i said no , i was his wife . she hung up immediately . __eou__ so you asked him about the girl who called ? __eou__ yeah , he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse , and so i pressed him on it . __eou__ what'd he do ? __eou__ he kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion .
dalian is a beautiful city . do you agree ? __eou__ i suppose i do . __eou__ the climate here is pleasant . __eou__ you said it . __eou__ this city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ it sure is . __eou__ no other city can match it . it's heaven . __eou__ well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . __eou__ maybe .

you are married to a foreigner , huh ? so what ’ s it like ? __eou__ well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . the things that are important to me are not important to him . we had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ yeah , i know what you mean . the first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ and now we have a two-year-old boy . we ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__ oh , so he ’ s half chinese and half american . that ’ s unusual . what languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ right now he speaks mostly chinese , and he can say a few english words . but he will learn . __eou__ what does he look like ? can people tell ? __eou__ yes , people surely can . he ’ s whiter than the chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . my husband says his eyes are very chinese though .
i think modern painting means nothing . __eou__ i think so too . it's just pointless . __eou__ then why are so many crazy about it __eou__ i don't know.maybe they are really crazy . __eou__ maybe .

what do you think of doctor thomson ? __eou__ i feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . __eou__ how can you be so sure ? __eou__ i can tell form the way he spoke to us . __eou__ never believe his words .
suit wrote me a letter . __eou__ what did she say ? __eou__ she got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . __eou__ really ? i can't believe it . __eou__ it's not a surprise , is it ? she has always been a hard working student . __eou__ but i think a master degree is good enough for a girl .
do you think they two will get married ? __eou__ you can count on it . __eou__ i think so.yes , they get along so well . __eou__ i like him.he ' s good for her . __eou__ you're right . he sure is .

what are you grinning about ? __eou__ stephany said she would go out with me . __eou__ i thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . __eou__ that ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . __eou__ all of your friends , what are you planning to do ? __eou__ we ’ re going fishing . __eou__ what a party ! i hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . __eou__ these girls are different , they are not wimpy .
my mom is three years older than my dad , and they are like night and day.my mom is 5 footsweet and very nice , and very caring , and very cute , everybody tells her how young she looks , and how she resembles my sister , perhaps.my father is very much completely opposite that.he is a very bi 4 , on a good day , 5 foot 2 , i think in real life , and she is very nice . __eou__ when is the last time you talked to you parents ? __eou__ i talked to them probably about two weeks ago . yeah , everything is going well . __eou__ are you going to see them soon ? __eou__ i am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a christmas kind of in january or february . yeah , depending on when my brother can come in . __eou__ ok . and who are you more like , your mother or your father ? __eou__ i think i have traits of both , actually . i look more like my mother .
did you like the party ? __eou__ not particularly . i was rather disappointed . __eou__ why ? what had you expected ? __eou__ i ’ d expected it to be much more exciting .
i want take shell on a date , but i don ’ t have much money . __eou__ what does she like to do ? __eou__ she likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food . __eou__ sounds like she has pretty pricy tastes . __eou__ well , i really like being with her . __eou__ have you thought about going in dutch ? __eou__ dutch , where is that ? __eou__ not where , what . dutch means you both pay your own way . __eou__ oh , i wonder if she ’ ll go for that .
most of our customers are foreigners . how many foreign languages can you speak , elizabeth ? __eou__ two . french and spanish . __eou__ and how well can you speak them ? __eou__ well , french was my best subject at school . i can read and write it pretty well . __eou__ and how about your spanish ? __eou__ well , it's not as good as my french . i can speak it reasonably well , but my written spanish isn't very good . __eou__ i see . well , we have a lot of spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any spanish here . __eou__ in that case , i'm fit for the position i think .
how many languages can you speak ? __eou__ i can speak french and german . __eou__ how well can you speak them ? __eou__ i can speak german quite well , but i can't speak french very well . __eou__ can you help me to translate these sentences into german now ? __eou__ no , but i'll be able to tomorrow .

you're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . __eou__ what makes you say that ? __eou__ i don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! that's just the problem . in these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . __eou__ but everything has been so easy . __eou__ everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . just like we planned ! that may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . you always say that . __eou__ yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . __eou__ okay . have it your way , but don't say i didn't warn you .
i don't know how to adjust my life . would you give me a piece of advice ? __eou__ you look a bit pale , don't you ? __eou__ yes , i can't sleep well every night . __eou__ you should get plenty of sleep . __eou__ i drink a lot of wine . __eou__ if i were you , i wouldn't drink too much . __eou__ i often feel so tired . __eou__ you better do some exercise every morning . __eou__ i sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . __eou__ why do you worry about your future ? you're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . i hope you take my advice .
dave , wake up . __eou__ which ? zina ? what time is it ? __eou__ it's seven-thirty . i want to know who left this note on my desk . __eou__ what note ? i can't see . i just pulled an all-nighter . __eou__ it's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen . __eou__ and ? what does it say ? isn't there a name ? __eou__ it says , zina , i like how you rhumba . an admirer .
are you feeling better today , bill ? __eou__ well , it's hard to say . i cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ you'd better give up smoking . it's bad for your health . __eou__ you're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ but you should make up your mind first . __eou__ you know , i often have to work til late at night . i need something to keep me awake . __eou__ why don't you go to bed and get up early ? you'll have the same time for work . __eou__ thank you for your advice ! i'll try it .
what do you mean ? if he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . __eou__ the boss wanted to pay bob with stock options . but bob didn't want to play that game again . __eou__ again ? __eou__ at his last start-up , bob worked for stock and no salary . they folded and he made zip . __eou__ ouch . __eou__ now he only works freelance . hundred bucks an hour .
vince , i think one of your programmers is spying on us for webtracker . __eou__ pardon ? __eou__ i won't say who , because i'm not sure yet . but i'll know soon . __eou__ zina , i hope you're not scheming to make elvin look bad . __eou__ it isn't elvin . __eou__ dave then ? dave is a spy for webtracker ? you can't be serious . __eou__ loan me that tape recorder you have . and don't say anything to anyone until i come back .
how do you get paid ? if you don't mind my asking . __eou__ not cash . but if our launch goes well , my stock options will pay off , big time . __eou__ and in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ? __eou__ i don't have to worry about rent . i live right here . __eou__ what ? in your cubicle ? __eou__ right here . me and my pc . home sweet home .
whoa . now i'm awake ! zina has a secret admirer . __eou__ i really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek . __eou__ i know what you mean . i can't stand computer geeks . __eou__ sorry , dave , i didn't mean you . i am just not in the mood for this . i have work to do . __eou__ who do you think it is ?
hey , zina . you're here early today . __eou__ yeah , i'm going to be making phone calls all day . what a blast . __eou__ i just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . i appreciate it . __eou__ save it , vince . after i put my first million in the bank , i'll say you're welcome . __eou__ fair enough.keep up the good work .
she is , like , mega-intense , isn't she ? __eou__ ha , she is unstoppable . i'm learning so much from her . __eou__ what's it like to work with her ? __eou__ she's demanding . but i like that . i mean , i know our timeline is tight . __eou__ tell me about it . __eou__ you guys are working around the clock , i know . that guy dave next to zina never leaves . __eou__ vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month .
your 3.5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million . __eou__ i need to be motivated , vince.multi - motivated . as in multi-million . __eou__ what if i said no ? __eou__ ever hear of webtracker ? __eou__ you wouldn't ! if you leave , you'll make nothing . __eou__ i might make nothing even if i stay . for that kind of risk , i want to get rich . __eou__ ok . if you sign the stars.com account before webtracker does , we'll talk next week .
i used to be down on the sales people until i saw her in action . __eou__ she means business , for sure . __eou__ most salespeople seem like half-brains . zina's definitely an exception . __eou__ we'd better get back to work . __eou__ yeah , i'm not too worried about vince , but i'd hate to face zina if we don't deliver ...
it's crunch time , isn't it ? i wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now i am . __eou__ no kidding . time is running out . __eou__ it would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters . __eou__ vince says he can't afford anybody else . we're got to come through . __eou__ do you think we'll make it ? __eou__ i guess we'll either make it , or we won't .
do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to vince ? explain the situation ? __eou__ no way . i want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . plus , what if it's vince ? __eou__ i don't think so . your admirer seems kind of sweet . aren't you even a little curious about him ? __eou__ he's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . i want no distractions . __eou__ a little distraction might do you some good , zina .
zina , can i talk to you about something personal ? __eou__ as long as it doesn't take too long . __eou__ my boyfriend says i work too much . that i spend more time with you than with him . __eou__ was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? __eou__ he said not to bother coming back . and i said , fine , i won't . __eou__ so what's the problem ?
either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime . __eou__ and it's all coming down to the next three weeks . __eou__ the only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is zina . __eou__ yeah , she is some kind of superwoman , isn't she ? __eou__ failure just isn't an option for her . i'm glad she's on our team .
ok , ann , you spent quite a bit of time in australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ i really liked living in australia . i was an international student and i studied education at the university of sydney . and living in sydney was fantasticbecuase i could go to the beach anytime i wanted and there was a great nightlife in sydney . there are lots of great clubs . and people were very , very friendly and easy-going and i met a lot of international people in living sydney . __eou__ mm-hm . how long were you there ? __eou__ i was there for almost a year . __eou__ oh , ok . __eou__ and i travelled a little bit in australia . i went up the east coast . up to frasier island . which is a world heritage site . and i saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . we climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . and the further north you go in australia , the hotter it gets . so we were able to go swimming in the ocean and i went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause i didn't have a diving license , so i went on an introductory dive and i saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that i was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ so , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ almost . __eou__ almost . ah , you're lucky . um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ exactly . __eou__ will you be going back to australia soon ? __eou__ i'd like to go and live there for at least another year . probably i'll go back to sydney or maybe i'll go down to melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . they have lot of museums and parks .
hello michael . __eou__ hello todd . __eou__ we're going to talk about australia . or your going to talk about australia . so first of all how any people live in australia ? __eou__ australia ? oh , there's about twenty million people in australia right now . a little bit under , but close to twenty . __eou__ ok . what are the biggest cities ? __eou__ the biggest city ? the biggest city is sydney , then it's followed by melbourne and then brisbane and then i think it's perth . but most of the big cities are on the east coast of australia . and perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . __eou__ ok . um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? __eou__ i like brisbane . i had my teenage years in brisbane , growing up in brisbane , um or maybe sidney because it is a big city , but brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ oh , nice . actually , what is the capital city of australia ? __eou__ ah , canberra is the capital city . but is not the biggest city . sydney is the biggest city . canberra was made sort of by the politicians so sydney wouldn't get to crowded . it's a separate territory .
ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from western style flower arrangement because in ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower . __eou__ what's another japanese art ? __eou__ japanese art ? mm , ikebana ! tea ceremony ! __eou__ tea ceremony ! tell me about tea ceremony . __eou__ tea ceremony ! it's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . __eou__ i see . __eou__ yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl __eou__ how do you learn that ? is that something that your mother would teach you ? how do people learn that ? __eou__ there's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . so you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy .
ok , devon , i've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy . __eou__ well , thank you . __eou__ what do you recommend ? what can i do to lose weight ? __eou__ well , i exercise a lot . i go running at least three times a week . but more than that i enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained . __eou__ yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that i actually exercise a lot . __eou__ do ya ? __eou__ yeah , so maybe it's my diet . __eou__ it could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . maybe , i eat three meals a day and i try not to snack in between . no potato chips . no popcorn . no candy bars . __eou__ that's pretty tough !
hello gina ! we've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! __eou__ hello sir . good to meet you , too . __eou__ oh , please don't call me sir . just call me jason . __eou__ ok , jason . so how was the flight ? __eou__ pretty good . there was a bit of turbulence while we were over the pacific ocean but it wasn't too bad . the worst thing was the guy behind me . he snored all through the night ! __eou__ really ? but you were in first class ! nobody woke that guy up ? __eou__ the stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . __eou__ that's terrible ! so you didn't get any sleep ? __eou__ not much ... but that's ok ... i'm a night owl anyway . __eou__ so , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in china ? __eou__ i'd love to squeeze in a trip to the great wall . __eou__ that's not a problem . we can have a company car take you there . it's only about a two hour drive .
so will you come to work with us ? __eou__ can i use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ? __eou__ we'll have to negotiate that . it's a possibility . __eou__ you miss me , don't you ? __eou__ don't push your luck , dave . __eou__ ok , i'm in . when do i start ? __eou__ as soon as you can get here . we'll be waiting for you .
i guess i'm just a little nervous . i'm giving everything i have to invoking , and ... __eou__ and what if it doesn't work out , right ? __eou__ exactly . __eou__ you need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . you know how i know ? __eou__ how ? __eou__ because i won't let it fail . __eou__ but what about tomorrow ? what if stars.com decides to go with webtracker , and not us ?
good morning , jason . how did you sleep ? __eou__ pretty well , thanks . still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night i got at lease six hours of rest . __eou__ great ! so , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? __eou__ yep . let's do it . i'm pretty excited ! __eou__ i know a place that should be perfect . it's called the china friendship shopping center and it's pretty much like an american mall - except with more variety . you can even buy a live chicken there if you want . __eou__ live chicken ? thanks , but no thanks . so ... tell me about bargaining . how can i do it like a local ? __eou__ well . i'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . you're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . but ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . __eou__ cool ! teach me ! __eou__ for starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . you've got to know what things cost . __eou__ someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . the idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . __eou__ that could be helpful . but when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . you have to be able to read the market .
ok . steven , you're looking at a picture . please describe what you see ! __eou__ uh , i can see a red double decker bus . it's the kind of bus you'll see very often in london . in fact i know this bus is from london because i can see the names , chelsea , sloan square , victoria , herring cross . these are all areas in london . um , so obviously the bus is in london . __eou__ ok . have you ever been on a double decker bus ? __eou__ yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . many times . when i was younger , you used to get double-decker all over england but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . __eou__ oh , really . mm ! how much is the fare ? __eou__ well , it depends on the journey . it's .. i guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . __eou__ mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? __eou__ hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! __eou__ is that how you feel on the bus ? __eou__ uh , well , no , not really , because i haven't worked in england for a long time , so i haven't taken a bus for a long time . __eou__ so , so you're british , do you missing them ? __eou__ um , yes , sometimes . sometimes .
this place is so quiet and peaceful . it ’ s really different from my pad at city . __eou__ sure , do you think you could live out here ? you know , back to nature at all ? __eou__ i don ’ t know . i don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon . __eou__ that ’ s what i was thinking . i mean can you imagine friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels . __eou__ i think i ’ d go lonely if i do like that . __eou__ and where would you get a cup of cappuccino ? __eou__ now that would be hard to live without . we city folks are pretty spoiled . __eou__ maybe . but i ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds .
morning , zina . just wanted to say thanks again ! __eou__ hi , vince . thanks for stopping by . how's the work coming along for the online auction ? __eou__ oh , yeah . i'm glad you mentioned that . i think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . __eou__ can't elvin handle it ? __eou__ i think he's got too much on his plate .
yeah . you don't need to rub it in . __eou__ and then she made the deal with micropower . vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... __eou__ fifteen ? and zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? __eou__ that's right . vince still stops by her office every day to thank her . __eou__ anyway , i'm still happy i left . i'm working as a freelancer now . __eou__ you really should have stayed with us , dave .
that's right . and i'm going to be vice president of marketing . __eou__ way to go , mary . a lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? __eou__ you can say that again ! __eou__ what's up with vince and elvin ? __eou__ they work for zina now . __eou__ and they're happy with that ? __eou__ they're in awe of her . after they saw how she crushed webtracker ... but i guess you know all about that .
this is going to surprise you , but i'm happy . i think you're making the right move . __eou__ you do ? __eou__ look , maybe i shouldn't tell you this , but i'v going over to webtracker , too . __eou__ no way ! that's great ! then we'll still be together ! __eou__ actually , i'm already working for webtracker . vince never wanted to give me what i was worth , so i figured , what the heck . __eou__ no kidding ! i can't believe this . you devil ! __eou__ it's kind of cool , isn't it ? i'm sort of like a secret agent .
is that you , dave ? oh , my gosh ! the backstabber who left us to work for the evil webtracker ! __eou__ yeah , yeah , yeah . hi , mary . how are you ? __eou__ i'm filthy rich ! haven't you heard about the micropower deal ? __eou__ yeah , i guess i did . they're going to buy invoking ? __eou__ that's right . for seventy-five million . so how are you ? __eou__ i'm getting by ok . i heard micropower was going to make zina president of their new invoking internet division .
hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? __eou__ i don ’ t know . __eou__ please think it over . __eou__ oh , i see . __eou__ come on , dear . i know you mustn ’ t forget it . __eou__ it ’ s saturday , a great weekend . __eou__ ur , you really let me down . __eou__ don ’ t be angry with me . i have a bad memory . __eou__ no , you haven ’ t . you just don ’ t care about me . you ’ re an indifferent husband . __eou__ what day is it on earth ? __eou__ it ’ s an anniversary of our weeding .
didn't joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? __eou__ he has no sense . __eou__ if i were him , i wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money . __eou__ but joe won't you .
does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ? __eou__ i think he has realized that . but he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act . __eou__ he might be driven up a wall . you should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves . __eou__ but when i noticed that he was left in the cold , i could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation .
susan is going to get a divorce . __eou__ how do you know that ? __eou__ she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . __eou__ oh , i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it .
hey , gucci . i didn't know it would be a charity show . you can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance . __eou__ oh , i forgot to tell you this . the show is to collect money for children in need . and all the money from ticket selling will go to the red cross . __eou__ that's really a good thing . let's do our part . __eou__ good idea . __eou__ who will sing in the show ? __eou__ a lot of stars , including andy , justin , mendy ... __eou__ mendy ? are you sure ? i love her songs ! __eou__ me too . she is so young and talented . she is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . __eou__ yeah . though she was so popular , i heard she managed to maintain a low profile . __eou__ she is a real star . not a onetime thing . __eou__ but i also heard some people didn't like her music . i don't understand why . she is so amazing ! __eou__ well , i suppose people have different tastes on music . moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . it takes time for people to accept new things . __eou__ you are right . anyway , things will be different as the days go on . she can get it . i have faith in her . __eou__ sure . that makes a good fan . do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? __eou__ here is the programme . check it out yourself ! __eou__ ok .
every year , the south has the floods . it is an act of god . __eou__ do you really think so ? __eou__ yeah , you have some other ideas ? __eou__ think , in some way it is an act of god , but in another way , it just is caused by us . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ we didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . __eou__ oh , i see . fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things .
john dates her seven times a week . __eou__ really ? that's a straws in the wind . __eou__ i think so . maybe he's fallen for her . __eou__ yeah . they suit each other . a perfect match between a man and a girl .
how do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? __eou__ at least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . i'm so fed up with the bland food . thank you for having lunch with me ! __eou__ any time . but i don't mind eating boxed lunch . the food sanitation is really good too . __eou__ it's hard to believe that you like it . you are so easy to be satisfied . __eou__ hey , it's not that bad . the food is nutritious and it's really convenient . i don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . __eou__ eating is important . you are what you eat . it's not only a daily routine . __eou__ well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? __eou__ no . i'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch . __eou__ but you didn't eat anything today . __eou__ well , the bill is paid by month . that's probably the only thing that i like about a take-out restaurant . __eou__ all right . i'm going to the mcdonald's . __eou__ for what ? i thought you didn't like western food . __eou__ no , i never did . it's for my son . he loves it , and i made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . __eou__ that's really smart . my son daniel is the same with your son . i just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . __eou__ me , either . but , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . __eou__ that's for sure . it's always hard for the parents to say no to their children .
sandra is actually blue chipper . i don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . __eou__ that's fate . __eou__ i feel sorry for her . __eou__ maybe this is god's will .
how many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? __eou__ we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education . __eou__ most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job . __eou__ but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she isa backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things .

you look great ! __eou__ thanks to you . i'm totally pumped up . __eou__ so you are happy that you made the decision to join us . __eou__ i surely am . but still there is one single problem . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ i eat more and more these days . and it puts even more weight on me . __eou__ it's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . what about trying something else ? __eou__ i'd love to do that . what do you recommend ? __eou__ more and more people are warm up to yoga these days . do you want to have a try ? __eou__ do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? __eou__ absolutely . but it takes great perseverance to master . __eou__ i can so that . __eou__ here is a free class going on right over there . go and join them . __eou__ how did it go ? __eou__ everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . so i think i may have dozed off for a minute over there .
welcome , young man . no offence , but i haven't seen you here before . __eou__ of course , this is my first time here . my mom has a membership here . here is the card . __eou__ okay then . you are the younger customer here ever . __eou__ it's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . __eou__ it's the marketing's fault , i suppose.what do you want to do ? __eou__ well , i want to become just like bruce lee . what should i do ? __eou__ that's a long way to go , i'm afraid . first of all , you gotta grow up . __eou__ i am still young . and i'm growing every minute . __eou__ sure . then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . __eou__ i love running . anything else ? __eou__ please change your clothes first ! __eou__ i'm perfect with my clothes . and i do not have anything else with me . __eou__ sorry , but no jeans here . __eou__ oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . i'd better just go home .
mom , this is your third bowl of rice ! __eou__ i know but i have no choice . my stomach just keeps crying for more and more . __eou__ why ? i never saw you eat so much before . __eou__ i've been going to the gym these days . the exercise makes me hungry all the time . __eou__ so your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out . __eou__ don't pull my leg . __eou__ this way you'll probably put on more weight . will you give up ? __eou__ surely not . i can feel the results . i'm starting to feel different now . __eou__ then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ? __eou__ i'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed . __eou__ oh , i've got an idea . why don't you ask dad to go with you ? he badly needs some exercise . __eou__ your father is a bit too timid . he even doesn't know how to introduce himself . __eou__ he can just say , i'm benjamin . i'm new and shy . __eou__ girl , don't make fun of your daddy . but i can introduce him to my personal trainer . maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . __eou__ who knows !
daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . __eou__ come on , just a little piece . __eou__ do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? __eou__ i have no idea . __eou__ just in beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . __eou__ that's amazing . __eou__ if all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . __eou__ come on , you are making too big deal out of this . __eou__ i just want to remind you to behave yourself . __eou__ ok , dear sister , i see . this kind of thing will not happen again .
come back . you haven't paid yet . __eou__ may , just let him go . __eou__ but he took some newspaper away without paying . __eou__ i know . __eou__ why ? you make me confused . __eou__ he lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . __eou__ why does he have such a privilege ? __eou__ he used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . __eou__ i see . does he live by himself ? __eou__ yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . __eou__ he must be lonely ? __eou__ i bet . but he is always busy telling the children stories . __eou__ how respectable !
hey , may , look , is that the the poster of the movie we saw yesterday ? __eou__ yes , that's right . that's the poster of the the witch . __eou__ may , i really regret watching it with you last night . __eou__ did it scare you ? __eou__ of course not . i just thought the movie was ... boring . __eou__ boring ? come on , you clutched to my arm all the time . __eou__ well , i admit . the ghosts were scary . __eou__ i like scary movies . __eou__ that's gucci's influence . i love science fiction movies ! __eou__ of course you do . they are silly stories just for little kids like you . __eou__ don't call me kid . i am a grownup . __eou__ do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ? __eou__ of course ! i can watch them without you ! __eou__ oh , really ?
have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? __eou__ yes . what a good job we have done ! __eou__ why are so many extra gifts left here ? __eou__ many customers didn't want them . __eou__ how about giving them to that old man ? __eou__ good idea . __eou__ by the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? __eou__ i'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . __eou__ i think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . __eou__ but people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . __eou__ that's true . __eou__ anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home . __eou__ okay . how tiring the job is !
what's your little caper ? come home so late ! we are all worried about you . __eou__ oh , i am terribly sorry . but i was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . so i forgot the time . __eou__ singing ? at the subway exit ? oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . __eou__ oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . he played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . he sang for appreciation , but not for money . __eou__ it is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it . __eou__ oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . i like it but i couldn't do it that well . __eou__ honey , just do it next time . have you heard of the real art in the subway station in russia ? __eou__ no , but tell me some . i am interested . __eou__ many oil painting exhibitions are there . that is a kind of museum exhibition . __eou__ are there many people there ? do you think people actually like them ? __eou__ i am sure you will . there are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . and people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . __eou__ but i still prefer the pop music in the subway . __eou__ both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values . __eou__ dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? __eou__ not well enough , but i'm learning .
i didn't expect to see you at this hour . you must have goofed off again . __eou__ goofed off ? maybe , but i'm not a clock-watcher . i finished doing what i should do and then knock off an hour earlier . __eou__ you'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . he may probably give you the bag . __eou__ i'm sure of what i'm doing .
do you know sally ? __eou__ sally . she is a bachelor girl . she is an excellent designer . many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . __eou__ why is she still single ? she must have a face that would stop clock . __eou__ oh , quite the other way round . she is a knock-out . she devotes much of her time to her career .
do you think you'll get the project ? __eou__ it's a chance in a million . i hear john is interested in it . __eou__ i see.after all , he's boss's son . __eou__ but anyway , i'll have a try .
what's his job ? __eou__ he used to be a policeman . __eou__ but mrs.smith hired him to find her lost son . __eou__ yeah . he's a private eye now .
he has a girlfriend already . __eou__ you are kidding ! he just broke up with ann . __eou__ her new girlfriend is a far cry from ann . she is like a breath of fresh air . __eou__ i hope i will meet her soon .
john seems to be in high cotton . he may well become a big shot . __eou__ i bet my button dollar that he won't . he is no more than a nine day's wonder . __eou__ what is your idea ? __eou__ many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear .
jack wonders whether linda likes him or not . __eou__ why doesn't he ask her ? __eou__ he is too scared to ask her . __eou__ he's a chicken guy .
i wonder how sarah and mat are . __eou__ don't you know they've already broken up ? __eou__ i'm not surprised . she's a plain jane . __eou__ and he's so handsome .
doesn't she have any friends ? __eou__ if she has , they must be fair-weather friends . __eou__ such friends are even worse than enemies . __eou__ she'd better keep away from them .
bob refused all his classmates ' invitation . __eou__ i really couldn't understand him . __eou__ he is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . __eou__ we'd better leave him alone .
have you ever run into a person who tries bleed you white ? __eou__ i am always on the look out for such girls . __eou__ i hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . __eou__ mark is one of them . he has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat .
does your wife work ? __eou__ yes , she does . she works at home . __eou__ oh , i understand . she cooks , cleans and takes care of children . is that right ? __eou__ oh , no . most of the time i do these things . she is a writer . __eou__ you are really a hen-pecked husband .
i decided to go for this kind of life . __eou__ try to keep cool . it's not an easy take . __eou__ i know . i always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . __eou__ then you will be in line for a doom .
we are going to the concert this evening . will you join us . __eou__ i'm very sorry i can't . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ i've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business .
may , we are fools to hang out at noon . it's dying hot today . my skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . __eou__ do you have any sunscreen lotion ? __eou__ you know , honey , i used it all on the way over . __eou__ i think i'm getting a heart stroke . __eou__ the heat is driving crazy and i hate my new hat . __eou__ why ? it's brand new , and it's perfect on you . __eou__ but i bought it to get rid of the heat . now it does nothing but burning my head . __eou__ beauty costs , honey . __eou__ laugh all you want , whatever . we need to get out of the heat . __eou__ walking under the sun is certainly not the way . __eou__ give me a break . it's not funny . __eou__ right . sorry . anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today . __eou__ hope so ! good thing is that autumn is just around the corner .
what's so special today ? __eou__ why ? __eou__ didn't you notice all the roses ? __eou__ it's july 7th . chinese valentine's day ! __eou__ oh , god . i just forget it . __eou__ i thought you had trouble with clive ! __eou__ no . but now he will be in bigger trouble ! what's a boyfriend for ? forget about valentine's day ? __eou__ poor guy ! it's not fair . you forgot it too . __eou__ oh , it's clive . __eou__ wow ! good timing . __eou__ excuse me for a while.clive asked me out to a movie ! do you want to join us ? __eou__ come on . two is company . __eou__ so what ? __eou__ it's valentine's day . come on . just go .
excuse me . where is q-duck ? i remember it was around the second intersection of this street . __eou__ q-duck ? do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? __eou__ yes , definitely . __eou__ they have moved to some other places long time ago . __eou__ wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when i first came to china . __eou__ yeah , a lot of changes have happened here . __eou__ this street used to have few stores . but now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . __eou__ yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . i always get lost in the supermarket . __eou__ me too ! i was lost three times ten years ago . there were no english directions then . __eou__ is that better now ? __eou__ yeah , there are many english signs , and wrong spellings as many as them .
who is that guy ? __eou__ it's clive of course . where did you come from ? every girl knows clive ! __eou__ really ? he is my type . __eou__ he is everybody's type . __eou__ what position does he play ? __eou__ shooting guard . the same as michael jordan ! __eou__ oh , i love michael jordan . he fills people's lives with great excitement . __eou__ used to . but now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . but kobe is the upcoming superstar now . __eou__ kobe is a good player but i heard he is a womanizer . __eou__ that is not true . they are just jealous of him ! __eou__ jordan is a legend , anyway . an idol that no one can replace . i think clive can make a good professional basketball player . he is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__ you know what , he is also an outstanding football player . he is surely to be a star of tomorrow . __eou__ by the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? __eou__ you are so not here ! his girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__ oh , my chance is slim then .
wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . __eou__ so no more regret now ? __eou__ don't remind me of that . this would be the last time i cut any classes for a basketball game . __eou__ come on . don't be so hard on yourself . enjoy your life . __eou__ i just can't help it . oh , look at clive , he is really a big hit . they are definitely gonna win . __eou__ it's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . __eou__ come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . __eou__ who knows ! it's a long game . look ! that was a really nice shot ! __eou__ thay are coming back to narrow the gap . __eou__ wait , that guy , i know him . he is just a bench warmer . __eou__ a secret weapon . they'd better set up the defense now . __eou__ clive is ready to explode . keep your eyes open . __eou__ oh , man ! i can't believe it . a slam dunk ! __eou__ good that he resembled his old , quick self .
what are you reading ? __eou__ gee ! you scared me ! __eou__ aha , fitness consultant . very good , don't you know about the rules in this office ? __eou__ yes , ma'am . no magazines during the office hours . i'm sorry . __eou__ well , don't do this again next time . what is it about , anyway ? __eou__ it is about sports for white-collar workers , people like you and me . __eou__ what kind of sports ? __eou__ aerobic sports , for example , jogging , yoga , skating ... __eou__ interesting . what were you reading just now ? __eou__ stretching exercise after sitting a long time . __eou__ really ? that sounds interesting ! __eou__ can i have my magazine back now ? __eou__ no . it's confiscated for now . and i will return it to you after i finish reading it .
daniel , what are you doing here ? aren't you supposed to be at school now ? __eou__ the same question to you . __eou__ well , we shall make it a secret between us . __eou__ deal , where is gucci ? __eou__ she is the cheer-leader . they are required to put on a performance . look ! here they come . __eou__ oh , look at her . she looks like one is the basketball babies in nba . __eou__ i want to be like her . __eou__ get real . don't be so pathetic . __eou__ hey , young man ! i'm your sis . don't talk to me like that . __eou__ oh , man , look at her , go ! she is amazing ! she should be my sis . __eou__ boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? __eou__ yes , i want to be her boyfriend . just like in the movie . __eou__ are you out of your mind ? __eou__ she told me she liked my new haircut . she thought it was cool . __eou__ go ahead , have a try and be a joke .
come on , you are left behind ! __eou__ wow , i can't catch my breath . you are running too fast , honey . __eou__ you just need more exercise . __eou__ yes , but you need to slow down . this is jogging , not racing ! __eou__ i don't care . i want to burn up my fat . __eou__ but running so fast is not good for people over forties . __eou__ why ? __eou__ we are not as athletic as we were when young . mild exercise is more suitable for us . __eou__ but i want to burn up more calories ! __eou__ in fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . __eou__ really ? i will slow down then .
honey , wait ! i've sprained my ankle . __eou__ oh , my god , are you ok ? __eou__ of course not ! __eou__ come on , sit down , and let me have a look . __eou__ the pain is killing me . __eou__ i told you to wear running shoes . but you don't listen . __eou__ i thought leather shoes will do just as well . __eou__ hold on , don't move , i will take care of that . __eou__ what are you going to do ? __eou__ i will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.how does that feel ? __eou__ god ! it's freezing ! __eou__ be brave . don't worry . you will be able to walk soon .
good afternoon , sir . you are really a regular customer here . may i ask you why you come here so often ? __eou__ i'm a newspaper columnist . i write comments for a living . i enjoy working in a coffeehouse . __eou__ i see . but isn't it a bit too noisy ? __eou__ i don't mind . by contrast , i quite like the circumstances , as i can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . and the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . __eou__ i can see that . then what is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ irish coffee is my favorite . but i can drink any other . i'm not particular on it . __eou__ all right . would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ not very often . making coffee is a bit troublesome . most of the time , i just buy takeout at starbucks . and also , i quite like instant coffee . __eou__ i think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ exactly . nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . people love it all over the world ? __eou__ which country makes the best coffee in the world ? __eou__ many people think brazil makes the best coffee . brazil exports a lot of coffee . but i love irish coffee . so it's hard to say . just depends on your taste . __eou__ i agree . i heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . is that true ? __eou__ yes . no doubt about that . for us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . i heard chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ no , we don't , especially the old people . but more and more young people fall for coffee . __eou__ i suppose so . that's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in china now .
hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? gatorade or water ? __eou__ gatorade . it ’ s rich in vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . __eou__ yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . one for each . __eou__ what should we do , now with jack out of the game ? __eou__ we should choose from the backups . __eou__ that ’ s right . spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . __eou__ that ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . __eou__ that ’ s for sure . during the back court , we should change the position we played . __eou__ yes , i played shooting guard , i like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , ok ? __eou__ i agree with you . i think we ’ ll play much better than before . __eou__ wow , the cheer-section is coming . the music is so fantastic . __eou__ yeah , look how passionate they are ! are they professional ? __eou__ well , you should ask your friend . you know i ’ m not the boss . just kidding . __eou__ oops ! i almost forget about it . do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? __eou__ yeah , what ’ s up ? __eou__ don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? __eou__ i also have a doubt . oh , kill me softly , she is may .
hurry up ! mom , i can't wait any more . __eou__ look out , honey . let's come to the shoal waters . follow me ! __eou__ ok , mom . can i swim now ? i want to learn butterfly stroke . __eou__ honey , listen to me . first , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . __eou__ mom , it's so terrible . water went down into my throat and i almost got drowned . __eou__ do be patient , honey . let's do it slowly and correctly . __eou__ oh , mom , i think i'm not the right person for swimming . __eou__ come on , sweetie , you've done very well . it is the first step that is tough . __eou__ right , i'll make up my mind . please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . __eou__ yes , well done . that's the way to go . how clever you are ! you've got it . __eou__ really ? i can't believe it . everything is possible to a willing heart . __eou__ exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head . __eou__ yes , like a dolphin . am i on the right track ? __eou__ that's the way to go . now , you are flying , my boy .
look , daddy is on again . don't you think he is handsome ? __eou__ to some extent , he is . and what do you think we move to a better place ? i can't see him clearly from here . __eou__ the seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . __eou__ oh , thank you for pointing that out . by the way , have you been following nba for this season ? __eou__ of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . __eou__ who plays who ? __eou__ rockets vs lakers . yao ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . __eou__ it's amazing . and when did he begin to play in the nba ? __eou__ in 2002 . and since then he has attracted more attention than ever . __eou__ i can't consider you as a little kid any more . i know he is very tall . __eou__ oh , you know something . he is 2.26 meters tall . but he is also nimble and skillful . __eou__ i also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . __eou__ yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . __eou__ that's really terrible . oh , god , we forgot to cheer for daddy . __eou__ never mind . after all he is not so attractive as yao ming , right ? __eou__ you are always so naughty .
hey , daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ hey , daddy , today i had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . what had happened ? __eou__ we've learnt the story of zheg he sailing to west ocean . he is a real great navigator . __eou__ did your teacher tell you the route he took ? __eou__ yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the indian ocean , and arrived at the east coast of africa . __eou__ great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? __eou__ of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in ming dynasty . __eou__ good , by the way , do you finish reading the book robinson crusoe i've bought for you ? __eou__ not yet , you know i have a lot of homework to do . __eou__ you should speed up , because the story of robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . __eou__ ok , great daddy , after supper , i'll embark on it . __eou__ that's my boy ! wait , daniel , when is pirates of the caribbean on ? __eou__ is it about captain jack sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? __eou__ exactly , now , tell me the time . __eou__ i won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you .
hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? i can't wait to dive into the water . __eou__ i'm sorry . every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . that's out regulation . __eou__ yeah , i see . you are just doing your job . but i wanna know what the advantages it has . __eou__ ok , lovely boy . try to be patient . do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? __eou__ as far as i know , people will be weak if they swim too long . __eou__ that's right . but the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . __eou__ is it very dangerous ? i'm a little scared . do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? __eou__ yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . __eou__ do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? __eou__ of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly .

look ! mom , that's amazing ! i can't believe the girls have so neat movements . __eou__ yeah , they all received very strict training . a minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . __eou__ and all their movements are so elegant . it seems like dancing in the water . __eou__ exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . __eou__ there you go ! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming . __eou__ that's my boy ! katherine curtis created this activity in 1920 . and in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in olympic games . __eou__ wow , mom is more knowledgeable than dad . i must learn from you . __eou__ my little boy , you should learn more from me . i'm almost thirty years older than you . __eou__ ok , you're the boss . look , mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . __eou__ oh , my god . it's so dangerous . and he might break his leg . you mustn't do anything like that .

thank you for showing me your offices , mr . becker . i can see why washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ why do you say that ? __eou__ the city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ i've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ sometimes that's true , but not usually . most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . it ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ how much do you make ? __eou__ i'm a gs - 15 . that's high on the scale of workers , but even a gs - 1 is paid a living wage .
which church do you attend ? __eou__ i am mormon , so i go to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints . __eou__ what ’ s the difference between this and other churches ? __eou__ mormons believe that , after the death of christ and the death of the apostles 10 , their church christ founded became corrupt and the authority of christ on earth was lost to men . in 1830 , a prophet named joseph smith was brought up by god to restore the church . __eou__ then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? __eou__ that means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . __eou__ do you believe that mormons have all of it ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ why do you really go to church ? __eou__ we gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . we come together and call it church .

a friend of mine is now in the big house . he was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . __eou__ that is a deadly risky business . he should have it coming on him . __eou__ he must be regretting about having done the business . __eou__ i bet he is . he domed his own life .

that was a great party . thanks for staying behind to help me clear up . __eou__ it certainly was a great party . it ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__ i expected that something might get broken . that doesn ’ t bother me . that spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__ i doubt it , i'll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , i ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__ i ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__ afterwards , we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks . __eou__ yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? he told some funny stories too . __eou__ amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party , she was being very serious . __eou__ i think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__ what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__ that ’ s my little secret . did you like the snacks that i prepared ? __eou__ very much . the birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__ that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes , so i think everyone liked it a lot . how ’ s that stain ? __eou__ all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up ?
you know john ? __eou__ which john ? mr.turnbow ’ s son ? __eou__ yes . i ’ ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . __eou__ and he ’ s bright and intelligent . i ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . __eou__ i wish he could too . __eou__ how ’ s your boy , jack ? __eou__ he ’ s a bit tired , you know . it often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . __eou__ poor boys ! they work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? __eou__ good luck to them .
there are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . the city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . __eou__ i like it . it makes the city feel alive . i like all the different colors and i like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . __eou__ i think that there are too many of them . i think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . they should have lower prices instead . then they would see more . __eou__ i see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . i agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . i don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . __eou__ i really hate receiving spam . i also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . __eou__ yes , that annoys me too . with billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . i like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . __eou__ i like that too . i don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . __eou__ that kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . they are always trying to maintain brand loyalty .
what ’ s your working day like ? __eou__ i have a typical 9 to 5 job . actually , i work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__ do you get paid onetime ? __eou__ no , i don ’ t . i get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts i sign with clients . __eou__ do you have any breaks ? __eou__ we have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . my boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__ my boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . i suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ there ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ yes , i do . i don ’ t like it very much . __eou__ i work in a cubicle too , but i i don ’ t mind it .
i ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ it would be very hard work . are you sure ? __eou__ i wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ that ’ s one reason i ’ d like to try it . i ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ you ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . it ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ my uncle owns a farm and i ’ ve spent some time working with him . i love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ well , i ‘ d certainly come and visit you . it would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . i ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while .
what kinds of tv programs do you enjoy watching ? __eou__ i like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . how about you ? __eou__ i like those kinds of programs too . they ’ re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv . __eou__ i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . __eou__ yeah . and that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! __eou__ right . you can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . __eou__ in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . __eou__ that ’ s great idea . but don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__ no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? __eou__ not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . __eou__ some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programs . besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . __eou__ well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
what do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ well , there are several things . of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ so , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ no . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs . __eou__ how can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ you need to invest in some good advertising . you have to know where your potential customers are and target them . it ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . the market is too small . __eou__ what else do you suggest ? __eou__ find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . they think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap .
what ’ s your city like ? __eou__ it ’ s quite an interesting place to live . the best thing to do in my city is go shopping . there are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ not really . cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . the public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ what about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ there are restaurants with food from all over the world . we have a small china-town near the city centre . there are many indian , thai , and italian restaurants all over the city centre . there are many sports events in my city . we have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey . __eou__ is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? __eou__ there are several good clubs near the city centre . many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . __eou__ it sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__ it is . i hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . you really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors .
aren ’ t you interested in watching the olympics ? there have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . __eou__ i just don ’ t find it very interesting . __eou__ i think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . __eou__ i think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . __eou__ i think the olympics help to promote world peace . __eou__ i ’ m not sure about that . we still have many wars in the world . i think that the idea behind the olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the olympics countries compete . there ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . __eou__ you are so pessimistic ! the olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . most people hope to see someone from their country win , but i think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete . __eou__ well . i think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the paralympics . __eou__ now there we are in agreement !
when i was at school , i was quite good at track and field events . i was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . __eou__ really ? i was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . __eou__ i wish that i were good at the discus , but i could rarely throw it in the right direction ! i was awful . with the hurdles , i could never jump over them ! __eou__ i thought you were good at the high jump ! __eou__ no , i was good at the long jump . i liked the sprints best . __eou__ did you ever win any competitions ? __eou__ i was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . i usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but i couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . how about you ? __eou__ i came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but i never won . did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? __eou__ yes , i did , but i didn ’ t do very well . i made the final in both events , but came last . at least i made the final . i was very pleased with that .
do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? i want to check the results from the world athletics championship . __eou__ yes , i ‘ m just reading them myself . it ’ s been a great competition . we got gold medals in three events . __eou__ yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . i watched that on tv . what other events did we win ? __eou__ we won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . __eou__ that ’ s great . those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . they must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . __eou__ the woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . __eou__ that ’ s amazing ! were any other records broken ? __eou__ a russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . __eou__ did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? it was very exciting . one competitor made two false starts . __eou__ was he disqualified ? __eou__ yes , he was . i imagine he must be very angry with himself for that .
i was just watching a documentary on tv about how people use dogs for various purpose . it was very interesting . __eou__ i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . __eou__ the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . __eou__ horses are useful to people too . we use them for sports and recreation . __eou__ don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . __eou__ can you ride a horse ? __eou__ yes , i can . i don ’ t ride regularly though . how about you ? __eou__ i can ride too . perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? __eou__ what a good idea !
what are you doing ? __eou__ i ’ m just looking at this map of the world . i ’ m preparing for a geography class . __eou__ there are no countries marked on the map . __eou__ no , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . look at the himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . __eou__ the thing that i find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . __eou__ i find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . __eou__ rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon . __eou__ the oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . __eou__ it ’ s all so interesting . i ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . or perhaps i should try and attend your geography class .
both our countries are quite small . how would you describe the landscape in your country ? __eou__ my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country . __eou__ is it really completely flat ? __eou__ pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . __eou__ yes , there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . __eou__ the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . __eou__ that doesn ’ t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs , then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . there are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . __eou__ there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . __eou__ we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water .
what do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ i think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . when we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ perhaps people should stop eating animals . we could grow more crops . __eou__ what would you do with all the animals ? you couldn ’ t just let them go . besides , some people would still hunt them . meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ that ’ s true . i think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . i think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ i agree . i ’ m an adult and i love going to the zoo . i don ’ t like animals experiments though . i believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ i read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ that ’ s good news . the good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ yes , i have . they do an excellent job .
i watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . it was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__ really ? tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__ well . there was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__ is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__ no , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because i ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__ so would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__ they showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . the insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . other insects cannot get it . of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another . __eou__ that ’ s very specialized . so , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__ that ’ s right . that ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__ i see . the plants that fascinate me most are cacti . i find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__ according to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__ that ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss .
your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . the flowers are really colorful . __eou__ thank you . i have roses , tulips , and daffodils . do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? __eou__ yes , i do . those are violets , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ yes , they are . this afternoon , i ’ m going to prune the hedge . __eou__ the lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . would you like me to cut them off for you ? __eou__ thank you ! that would be very kind of you . i have a saw in the garden shed . __eou__ when the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . __eou__ tomorrow , i ’ ll cut the grass . then the garden will look perfect . __eou__ just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers .
good morning . i ’ m from the new york book review . could i ask you some questions about your latest book ? __eou__ sure . take a seat ... what would you like to know ? __eou__ first , i ’ ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . __eou__ that ’ s correct . it ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . the main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . __eou__ how do you research your books ? __eou__ i always visit the places that i use as setting for stories . readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! i usually base my characters on people i have met . most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . __eou__ i really like your books . i ’ ve just finished this one . i read it from cover to cover in a single day . congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! __eou__ thank you . let met sign it for you ... there you go . __eou__ oh ! thank you very much . i heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . what are the stories about ? __eou__ there ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . i haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . if you give me your business card , i ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review . __eou__ thanks very much . i ’ m sure it will sell well . i can ’ t wait to read it . here ’ s my card . thank you for you time .
which countries have you been to ? __eou__ i ’ ve been to most of the countries in europe , several countries in asia , china , japan , korea , and thailand , and to the united states and canada . __eou__ i thought you had been to australia too . __eou__ no , but i ’ m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ’ ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ’ ve been to ? __eou__ i think i'd say norway . it has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ well , the north of norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ i ’ ve been to other scandinavian countries , but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
ok . let ’ s look at our short presentation on china . what do we need to include ? __eou__ we need to talk about the size of the country and its population . __eou__ ok . china is about the same size as canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . __eou__ it says here that most of the people are han chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . __eou__ we need to say something about the geography and climate of china . is there any way to divide the country into sections ? __eou__ we could divide into five parts . there ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . the rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . one is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . then , in the south it is hot most of the year . __eou__ that sounds very general . __eou__ it is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . we can select cities from each part and give data for each one . __eou__ one from each part ? lhasa , urumqi , harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . the capital city is beijing , right ? __eou__ yes . the other large cities are chengdu , dalian , wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , chongqing . hongkong and guangzhou . __eou__ we should take a large map and highlight those cities . what is each of them famous for ?
hi , mark ! long time no see ! __eou__ hi , alex ! __eou__ where have you been ? __eou__ i just got back from london . __eou__ how was your flight ? __eou__ it was ok . there was a lot of turbulence , though . __eou__ that ’ s too bad . how long was the flight ? __eou__ it was 10 hours . __eou__ did you have a layover ? __eou__ yes , in paris , france . __eou__ did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? __eou__ yes . i bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! __eou__ oh , you didn ’ t have to ... __eou__ it was nothing .
what ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? __eou__ those tow games are quite different . first , there ’ s the size of the teams . in football , a team has 11 players . in rugby there are 15 players on each team . the biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . in rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . __eou__ in rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? __eou__ that ’ s right . however , players can only pass the ball backwards . they cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . that ’ s a foul . __eou__ i know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? __eou__ if a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . a team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . __eou__ there ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? __eou__ yes . players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . this is called ” tackling ” , as in football . __eou__ the ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ yes . it ’ s not perfectly round like a football . a rugby ball is oval in shape . there ’ s a match on tv this afternoon . why don ’ t you watch it with me ? i ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . __eou__ ok .
hello . nice to see you again . i heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . i hope everything ’ s ok . __eou__ yes , fine . i had something wrong with my stomach . i won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious . __eou__ i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . __eou__ i think most people are a little nervous about it . i was really very , very nervous just before i had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing i remember was waking up after the operation . __eou__ it must have really hurt afterwards . __eou__ well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . i wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . that was the worse thing . __eou__ i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . __eou__ i certainly was ! however , the doctor gave me a list of food i couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! __eou__ is there any pain now ? __eou__ no , not at all . i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . __eou__ did they take good care of you in the hospital ? __eou__ oh , yes . the nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what i could drink . in the end , i just drank water and nothing else . everyone was very professional and i actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .
how do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ i think that the public transport system could be made simpler . i never know where the bus routes actually go . the routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . __eou__ i think we just need to build more roads . then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . __eou__ if we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . i think we should discourage people from using their cars . __eou__ how would you do that ? __eou__ i think we should do a few things at once . improving public transport would encourage people to use that . if we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . __eou__ i don ’ t know . i think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . they already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . __eou__ i think that they should pay more tax . look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . __eou__ the air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . the problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . it well be unpopular . __eou__ that ’ s a good point . car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it .
did you hear about car accident on spring road yesterday ? __eou__ yes , i did . i heard that they took both drivers to hospital . one needed surgery . __eou__ yes . i heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems . __eou__ the second driver was luckier . he had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . __eou__ yes . he was released from hospital yesterday evening . the other man could be there for weeks . __eou__ i understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . his condition can ’ t be very good . __eou__ the hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . what does that mean ? __eou__ it means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive . __eou__ his family will be pleased to hear that . they must have been so worried .
is your city a historical place ? __eou__ not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . __eou__ how did it grow into such a large place ? __eou__ large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . __eou__ as the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . __eou__ yes , it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . __eou__ i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? __eou__ oh , yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . __eou__ really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
what ’ s your favourite ball sport ? __eou__ i like basketball . i really enjoy watching the nba games on tv . __eou__ who ’ s your favourite player ? __eou__ i don ’ t really have one but i support huston . __eou__ do they have a good team ? __eou__ i think they do , but i ’ m biased . they have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__ i can ’ t keep up with the game . the players play so quickly that i can hardly see what they are doing . __eou__ i have the same problem . the players are really very skilful . i wish i could play that well . __eou__ you play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , i do . we ’ re doing pretty well this season . we ’ ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . __eou__ how many more games are there this season ? __eou__ we ’ ve got four more games . i hope we can win all of them .
hello ! how are you . __eou__ not too well ! i ’ m just to the doctor . i haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days . __eou__ what have you got ? a cough ? a cold ? __eou__ that ’ s the funny thing . i don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . i just feel exhausted . __eou__ perhaps you ’ ve been working too hard . you do have a high-pressure job . __eou__ maybe . i haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . that ’ s unusual . __eou__ well . i ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . dr . jameson is very good . __eou__ yes , he is . i ’ ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so i ’ d better move along . __eou__ ok . hope you feel better soon . you should take it easy . i ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know .
i would like to watch the oscars on tv tonight . how about you ? __eou__ yes , i'd love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . __eou__ i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ i'm really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ you ’ re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ you might think this strange , but i like the category for “ best foreign language film " . __eou__ it ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the “ best actor and actress ” .
you ’ re a big fan of andy lau , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , i ’ ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he ’ s my idol . __eou__ how come you don ’ t have all of his films on dvd ? __eou__ some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . __eou__ i see . i ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him . __eou__ yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . __eou__ are you a member of his fan club ? __eou__ i was , but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so i ’ m not a member now . __eou__ did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? __eou__ of course ! i bought two copies . __eou__ two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ?
i think that show biz stars have a really easy life . they have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . they ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . __eou__ i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it . __eou__ i bet they love it really . sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films . __eou__ no way ! they want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . __eou__ show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that ’ s why they need so much money . they need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . i bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . __eou__ i don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . __eou__ i think you should give them some credit . they ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . __eou__ come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。
hi ! i see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . __eou__ there ’ s so much i want to do . i ’ ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . i just ran a search for music to download . __eou__ i can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . __eou__ thanks . that would be very helpful . i ’ ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . there ’ s too much information on the net . __eou__ when you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? __eou__ yes , i did . there ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so i ’ m sure i haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . __eou__ when you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . if you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things . __eou__ that ’ s good advice . i should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . __eou__ that ’ s right . another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . __eou__ how do i do that ? __eou__ take this web page for example . press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . there you are . it has been added to you favourites list . if you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again . __eou__ that ’ s useful to know . thanks . i ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .
i would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . __eou__ really ? i ’ m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__ i love being photographed ! if i were famous , i ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__ i wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . __eou__ no-one really believes gossip columnists . __eou__ i think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines . __eou__ i think you ’ re right about that . i ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . i could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . __eou__ that ’ s a great idea . which charities would you support ? __eou__ i love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__ you ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . anyway , i ’ d be the first to buy your posters and i ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography . __eou__ thanks , but actually i was hoping i could ask you to write my biography .
hi ! is that the new laptop you brought last week ? it looks very nice . __eou__ yes , it is . thanks . i ’ m just surfing on the internet . __eou__ here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ? __eou__ this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i ’ m here . of course , i have to buy a cup of coffee ! __eou__ that ’ s great . can you do it anywhere ? __eou__ no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . __eou__ so , what programs do you have on your laptop ? __eou__ i ’ ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs . __eou__ i know you are keen on photography . it ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! __eou__ it ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? would you like to see some photos that i look recently ?
do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? __eou__ yes , i do . i also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . there are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very careful and keep you computer clean . __eou__ how often do you run your anti-virus program ? __eou__ i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time . __eou__ which anti-virus program would you recommend ? __eou__ how you tried this one ? it ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free . __eou__ that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ? __eou__ just a minute ... go to this one . i ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated . __eou__ what do you use your computer for ? __eou__ i use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . i don ’ t play many games on my computer , but i do a lot of work with photographs . using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . you can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones . __eou__ computers are great , aren ’ t they ? i should download some program and learn how to use them .
how often do you use the internet ? __eou__ i use it almost every day , but i usually only use it to check my email . i don ’ t often surf the net . you use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes . i use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . it can be frustrating when the connection is poor . __eou__ so , you ’ re online eight hours a day . __eou__ yes , i like the job though . sometimes , i help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . __eou__ how useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? __eou__ i think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . first , a lot of the information you find online is false . second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . __eou__ how do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? __eou__ what i do is find the website of shops . then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable .
what do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ i ’ d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end . __eou__ how do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ i don ’ t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . __eou__ so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive . __eou__ the problem is that many poor people might suffer .
it ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . the air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ would you like to live in the country ? i ’ m not sure i ’ d like it . __eou__ i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ well , i hate the noise in the city , but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the two just don ’ t go together . __eou__ i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city , but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ people can ’ t have it both ways . if you live in the country , it is often less convenient . if you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . __eou__ i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there ’ s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful . __eou__ just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . there ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . there ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ you ’ re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
do you believe in god ? __eou__ not at all . i ’ m an agnostic . do you ? __eou__ i ’ m not sure . why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? __eou__ i think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . __eou__ i basically believe in science over theology . i mean , i believe in evolution for example . however , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . __eou__ i ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . __eou__ yes . such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
i can ’ t believe my english teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! __eou__ why not ! it ’ s a classic . in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . __eou__ but it ’ s so old . __eou__ don ’ t judge a book by its cover . do you kwon what it ’ s about ? __eou__ no , not at all . __eou__ first of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . __eou__ i didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . what ’ s the main storyline ? __eou__ it ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . __eou__ why does he want to do that ? __eou__ since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . that way , all of his daughters will be cared for . __eou__ won ’ t they get his inheritance ? __eou__ no , that ’ s the problem . though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . so , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . __eou__ i see . this sounds interesting ! maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . __eou__ so , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? __eou__ there ’ s movie ? my teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! __eou__ that ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . __eou__ it would take a lot less time ... __eou__ how about this . when you finish the book . i ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . __eou__ ok . that sounds like a deal .
do you think children watch too much tv ? __eou__ i only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . i don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . i think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . __eou__ perhaps i should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . they don ’ t do much else in their free time . at least they always do their homework first . __eou__ if you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . if you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . __eou__ they could go out and play with their friends . __eou__ sure . you could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . __eou__ perhaps i could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . he watches too much tv too . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit .
hi ! what are you watching ? __eou__ it ’ s a program about islam . it ’ s very interesting . __eou__ wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” . __eou__ why do they go there ? __eou__ muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ when muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ that ’ s right . unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ that ’ s right . that ’ s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ yes . in england , christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ i think that place is lourdes . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . i don ’ t think place is magical in any way .
what ’ s the plot of your new movie ? __eou__ it ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . it ’ s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes , but i hope audience won ’ t be too scared to go to the movie theatres ! __eou__ did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . __eou__ i have had disagreement with every director . i ’ ve worked with . we ’ ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don ’ t know where rumours of my disagreement with rachel kelly come from . we got on very well and i hope to work with her again . i enjoyed making the movie very much . __eou__ critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ ve made recently . does that bother you ? __eou__ not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think . __eou__ did you do you own stunts in the movie ? __eou__ i wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . all of my stunts were done by a stuntman . as you know , i used to do my own stunts , but i ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . __eou__ thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__ my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__ yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you , i was very impressed with rachel ’ s performance in the movie . she ’ s going to be a star .
which language do you speak ? __eou__ well , i studied french at school , but i ’ ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes . do you speak japanese at home with your parents ? __eou__ yes , i do . i ’ m learning chinese now on the internet . __eou__ how do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ it ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ i bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both chinese and japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ so , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ yes . how are the spanish classes going ? __eou__ in a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning chinese . some spanish words are very similar to english ones . but i need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself .
hi , charlie ! what are you reading ? __eou__ hi , bob . i ’ m reading a biography ? __eou__ who ’ s it about ? __eou__ it ’ s about bob dylan . __eou__ who is he ? __eou__ he ’ s a famous american musician . __eou__ who ’ s the author ? __eou__ it was written by howard sounds . __eou__ what do you think about it ? __eou__ it ’ s great ! i ’ ve learned a lot from reading it . __eou__ can i read it when you ’ re done ? __eou__ sure , bob ! i ’ m on chapter 12 now , so i ’ m almost finished . __eou__ how many chapters does the book have ? __eou__ there are 15 chapters in total . __eou__ when do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? __eou__ i should be done by friday . i ’ ll give it to you in class then . __eou__ thanks . charlie ! __eou__ no problem . bob .
shall we go to cinema this evening ? the new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . it ’ s supposed to be really good . __eou__ what kind of movie is it ? i don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . __eou__ it ’ s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead . __eou__ i like thrillers and i like julia roberts , so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . __eou__ what did the critic say ? __eou__ he didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . __eou__ the movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . __eou__ good . dinner is nearly ready and i ’ d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results . __eou__ i won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
what are you reading ? __eou__ it ’ s an article about language . it talks about the idea of having a single global language . __eou__ it seems that english already is the main global language . does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like esperanto as the world language . __eou__ actually , it suggest english . the main argument is that english is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , india , mexico , nigeria , pakistan , and japan . so beginning again with a language like esperanto would be wasteful . the second argument is that english is used in modern technology far more that any other language . most emails are sent in english and the vast majority of website use english . __eou__ does the article say anything about other language ? how will they survive in an english-speaking world ? __eou__ the article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if english continues to be the dominant language . __eou__ right . all the people who speak chinese . hindi , french and spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . __eou__ exactly . the article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers . __eou__ in that case , i shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages .
are you an art aficionado ? __eou__ not really . i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . i hardly know anything about art or sculpture . you are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ i love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . __eou__ i never understand the meaning of those painting . they are too abstract for me . i didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . __eou__ art isn ’ t for everyone . i ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . it ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . __eou__ i like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or greece . what time are you thinking of going ? i ’ d love to go with you . __eou__ i thought i ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . does that sound ok to you ? bus 51 goes directly there . __eou__ that sounds fine . what time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__ let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .
how many people are in your family ? __eou__ as you know , china has a single-child policy . therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and i . what about in your family ? __eou__ i have one daughter and one son . then there ’ s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ? __eou__ not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ? __eou__ my parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ? __eou__ no , i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ? __eou__ i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters . __eou__ how long have you been married ? __eou__ about seven years now . and you ? __eou__ i've been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ? __eou__ it ’ s becoming more and more common . however , i don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ? __eou__ if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , i would get a divorce . __eou__ if that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! __eou__ ( ha ha ) i ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . __eou__ of course not !
the art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . he says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . __eou__ really ? i thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . what did you think of it ? __eou__ i liked it . i didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__ i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . he doesn ’ t seem to like anything . which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? __eou__ i like landscapes and still life . you prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , i do . i like painters who use will rather than watercolors . the colors appear richer . what do you think ? __eou__ i agree . i prefer oils too . i collect landscapes , but i only have a small collection . you have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes . good artwork is very expensive nowadays . when i was in china , i bought some calligraphy by famous artists . you should come and see it sometime . __eou__ that would be nice . can you read the characters ? __eou__ i know what the characters on the paintings mean . i think chinese characters look very artistic . it ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__ i think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts .
i ’ m going to the beauty parlor . do you want to come too ? __eou__ sure . let ’ s go . what are you going to have done ? __eou__ i want to have a foot massage and haircut . __eou__ a foot massage sounds like a great idea . they are very relaxing . i ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . it ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . __eou__ good idea . we should also pedicures and manicures . __eou__ this could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour ! __eou__ i think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . don ’ t you agree ? __eou__ oh , i agree . we both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . __eou__ maybe we should try a thai massage too . __eou__ what ’ s special about a thai massage ? __eou__ that ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet . __eou__ sounds painful !
are you interested in history ? __eou__ yes , i am . i enjoyed studying it at school , though i had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__ i love history , but i ’ ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__ i wish you had been my history teacher ! i might have got better marks ! __eou__ some people say that history repeats itself . __eou__ what does that mean ? the same events never happen twice , do they ? __eou__ the idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . __eou__ i see . i think i ’ d agree with that statement . people often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
who is cindy ’ s husband ? __eou__ cindy ’ s husband is ron . __eou__ how many children do cindy and ron have ? __eou__ they have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . __eou__ do they have any grandchildren ? __eou__ yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . __eou__ does their daughters get along well with her in-laws ? __eou__ yes , she gets along with them quite well . __eou__ do they have a large family ? __eou__ their family is very similar to cindy and ron ’ s family .
when you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? __eou__ i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ? __eou__ i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill . __eou__ that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . __eou__ that ’ s what i thought . i just thought i ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? __eou__ well , it was a warm evening , so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually , several other people had the same idea . i saw bill . __eou__ did you ? how is he these days ? __eou__ he seemed ok . we didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other . __eou__ i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ? __eou__ of course . what do you want to move first ? __eou__ let ’ s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ’ ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
do you like barry ? __eou__ no , not very much . he ’ s too ambitious and dishonest . __eou__ i agree . i like his brother , paul . they are not alike . __eou__ yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . __eou__ what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ i think i ’ m polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ oh , i don ’ t think you ’ re shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ well , yes , but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first . perhaps i ’ m not as shy as i think . anyway , you ’ re certainly not shy ! __eou__ you ’ re right . i love going out and making new friends . __eou__ so , you ’ ll be at my birthday party on friday ? __eou__ of course !
how old is keith ? __eou__ he ’ s 21 . how old is james ? __eou__ he ’ s a year older than keith , but he looks younger . __eou__ how ’ s your father ? __eou__ he ’ s fine . he retired last week . it ’ s turning going in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__ he can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__ oh , i don ’ t think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__ so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea ! __eou__ how do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__ in the same way , probably .
how do you think people get their personalities ? __eou__ i think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . __eou__ don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? __eou__ no , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . __eou__ so why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . __eou__ maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . __eou__ you might be right . i guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . you know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . __eou__ do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? __eou__ maybe some of it . i think a lot of people blame tv and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . __eou__ parents have a difficult job . they have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . __eou__ yes , that ’ s true . your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ yes , he is . he ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . after dinner , he goes out with his friends . __eou__ so , he ’ s not a bookworm ? it ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . some kids are very quiet and introverted . you wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them .
i've heard you're going to america tomorrow . i want to see you off at the airport . __eou__ oh , thanks a lot . __eou__ what time are you leaving ? __eou__ 1 thirty p . m . but i've got to check in at 12 thirty p . m . __eou__ what airline and what flight ? __eou__ pan american airlines . flight 282 . __eou__ i'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty p . m . __eou__ ok . see you tomorrow .
that girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? __eou__ do you think so ? i don ’ t like girls who look like that . i like girls who aren ’ t too slim . if you like her , go and talk to her . __eou__ i ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . he ’ s very broad-shouldered . __eou__ he ’ s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . __eou__ do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? __eou__ i don ’ t mind , but i like girls with long hair . __eou__ we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls - probably because i ’ m so tall myself . __eou__ have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? __eou__ no , never . i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ? __eou__ yes , i have . perhaps i should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . __eou__ i'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ’ ll go with you .

london is such a historical city ! there ’ s history everywhere you look . there ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . he won the battle of trafalgar in 1805 . __eou__ i ’ m looking forward to seeing westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like isaac newton , the great mathematician and winston churchill , the great wartime leader . __eou__ nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of boadicea . she fought the romans when they invaded britain . __eou__ women have often played an important role in british history . queen elizabeth i built a navy strong enough to fight off the spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s . __eou__ she was a very controversial leader . are we going to visit the famous tower of london later ? __eou__ there ’ s a lot to see there . perhaps we should go tomorrow . __eou__ i ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . i really want to see the crown jewels too . __eou__ i ’ ve seen them before . they ’ re quite incredible . if you want to see historical figures in london , there ’ s one place you have to go . __eou__ where ’ s that ? oh , i know ! madame tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . __eou__ there you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . __eou__ sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !
hi ! how are you going ? __eou__ fine , thank you . how are you doing this morning ? __eou__ not bad . how about you ? haven't seen you for a long time . __eou__ yes . i've been to new york . i got back only yesterday . __eou__ did you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ very much . new york is such a nice place . shall i show you some photographs ? __eou__ thanks , i like looking at photographs . how nice ! oh , i'm afraid i must be going now . i've got an appointment . have a good day . __eou__ you too . i hope to see you soon . goodbye . __eou__ goodbye .

is everything ready for billy ’ s birthday party ? __eou__ yes . i ’ ve finished making the birthday cake and i ’ ve put all the things on the table . did you find the party hats ? __eou__ yes , i did . i ’ ve put one on the table for each child . i put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too . __eou__ thanks . do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ? __eou__ i ’ m sure of that . there ’ s enough food here to feed an army ! __eou__ that birthday cake looks wonderful , but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet . __eou__ thanks for reminding me . i ’ ve prepared some party games for the children too . __eou__ i ’ ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . __eou__ hopefully , that will keep everyone happy .
how do you celebrate national day in your country ? __eou__ there are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . __eou__ what kinds of parades are there ? __eou__ the parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . what do you do on national day in your country ? __eou__ we don ’ t have a national day . __eou__ really ? that ’ s unusual . __eou__ i guess it is . most countries have on , but we don ’ t . __eou__ actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . in the evening , many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day .
what kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? __eou__ as in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . young people are attracted to that field in particular . there ’ s also been a big growth in education . __eou__ there ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . a lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . __eou__ the interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . they are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . __eou__ i noticed that too . what are the people learning ? __eou__ in my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . __eou__ i think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . __eou__ that trend has already begun in my country . in particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? __eou__ those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . __eou__ yes . my country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . however , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . __eou__ they are well known for high quality , that ’ s why .

hello mike ! would you like a drink ? __eou__ no , thank you . i had too much to drink yesterday evening . i had a bad hangover this morning . my head felt terrible . __eou__ were you celebrating something ? __eou__ yes . it was a friend ’ s birthday party . we drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . after midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! __eou__ it ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . you should stick with one for the whole evening . __eou__ i know , but it was a celebration , you kwon ? i don ’ t think i ’ ve see you drunk . __eou__ i usually only drink beer and i rarely drink more than a few pints . __eou__ you are a sensible drinker . anyway , i ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . i don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover . __eou__ let me buy you a soft drink then . how about a coke ? __eou__ yeah . that ’ s a good idea . i heard that coke was first used as a medicine . __eou__ rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . here ’ s the money . __eou__ are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ? __eou__ yes . i thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... __eou__ ... and taste a few ! there will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not . __eou__ yes . i ’ m looking forward to it .

dalian is a beautiful city . do you agree ? __eou__ i suppose i do . __eou__ the climate here is pleasant . __eou__ they use said it __eou__ this city is really comfortable to living . __eou__ it sure is __eou__ no other city can match it . it's heaven . __eou__ well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . __eou__ maybe . __eou__ that's for sure .
i can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . __eou__ well , if i were you , i'd go on studying . __eou__ but i don't even know what to study . __eou__ if i had chance again , i'd major in english . you're good at language . __eou__ that's what my parents want me to do . __eou__ you should take their advice . they know what's best for you . __eou__ but my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while i spend all my time doing reading and writing . __eou__ but if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . __eou__ hm , what you say makes sense . but you know , i still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and i hate to do so at this age . __eou__ and if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . __eou__ you're right . thank you for the advice .
are you feeling better today , bill ? __eou__ well , it's hard to say . i cough a lot in the evening . __eou__ you'd better give up smoking . it's bad for your health . __eou__ you're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . __eou__ but you should make up your mind first . __eou__ you know , i often have to work till late at night . i need something to keep me awake . __eou__ why don't you go to bed and get up early ? you'll have the same time for work . __eou__ thank you for your advice ! i'll try it .
what ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ i ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ? __eou__ about 70 , i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ did she ? that ’ s great . however , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ how ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ oh , he ’ s fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ he ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ i had mine when i was 24 . that ’ s a little young . i ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ yes , i think you ’ re right . i ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ yes , there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life . parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ it ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict , kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient , they might go wild .
have you heard of paul ? __eou__ no , what ? __eou__ he's got a promotion . __eou__ you're kidding . __eou__ no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . __eou__ oh , i don't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years . __eou__ well , it's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul . __eou__ well . good for him .

you honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? __eou__ yes , i do . i think that science is making us wiser . what do you think ? __eou__ i don ’ t think you ’ re right there . __eou__ i believe industry is making us wealthier . __eou__ i don ’ t believe that . __eou__ and in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . __eou__ i agree with you in the sense . but we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ i don ’ t agree with you . i maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . __eou__ that ’ s your opinion not mine .
i ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . __eou__ yes . i dare say it will be . __eou__ it will be sunday so i expected everything will be closed . __eou__ no . i don ’ t think that ’ s possible . some places are sure to be open . __eou__ but the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money . __eou__ mmm , you may be right . __eou__ do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? __eou__ no . we couldn ’ t possibly . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ it will be summer . so it will be hot . __eou__ is that very likely in england ? __eou__ yes . it could happen .

sam , what shall i do with my stocks ? will i lose money ? __eou__ there ’ s a possibility . __eou__ what do you mean by that ? __eou__ i mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . __eou__ is that so ? __eou__ absolutely . take my word for it .
hi , how ’ re you doing ? __eou__ terrible . __eou__ oh , what ’ s the matter ? __eou__ i ’ ve got a fever and really a bad headache . __eou__ oh , that ’ s too bad . why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? __eou__ i ’ ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . __eou__ well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . __eou__ yeah , i guess i should . __eou__ well , you ’ d better get some rest . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ bye .
lisa , i ’ ve been thinking of something . __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ well . i ’ ve done a lot of business for my company . and now i feel like going into business for myself . __eou__ do you mean you want to sell up your company of your own ? __eou__ there ’ s a possibility . what do you say ? __eou__ that ’ s not a bad idea . bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee .
post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . __eou__ nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . take mailing for example . do you send something first class or second class or do you use ems ? __eou__ i save money in a post office saving account . there used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . they each have different conditions and interest rates . __eou__ you can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . you can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and christmas cards ... __eou__ post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . the queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . __eou__ my son likes going to the main post office . they have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . __eou__ do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? __eou__ i think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . __eou__ i like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . it means that i don ’ t need to go to two places
how did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? i hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . __eou__ oh , it was great . we had seafood buffet . they do one every friday . the waiters and waitresses are very good . they are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . __eou__ i like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because i don ’ t feel extremely hungry . i like the wine list there too . __eou__ yes , so do i . they have wines from all over the world . there is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . we ordered some australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . __eou__ some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? __eou__ they had almost every kind of seafood . there were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . i ate a lot of smoked salmon . __eou__ did they have lobster ? __eou__ no , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . i think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . __eou__ yes , it probably is . i don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . you never know whether they are fresh . __eou__ i know . i didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . __eou__ when you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? __eou__ not usually . i usually just order a main course and have a dessert if i ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__ oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? __eou__ no , i might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day .
i ’ ve just take out an insurance policy . are you insured ? __eou__ yes , i am . i have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . __eou__ i took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . you are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job . __eou__ i need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if i die . __eou__ i can terminate my life insurance policy when i retire and use the money as a pension . __eou__ that ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too . it covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . __eou__ did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ? __eou__ yes , i did . it was one of the conditions of the insurance policy . the insurance company need to assess the risk .
look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like versacci , calvin klein , and vivienne westwood . what do you think of them ? __eou__ well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . i mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? __eou__ i know what you mean . people would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . i suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . __eou__ maybe . i ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . hardly anyone will buy those clothes . the clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . it seems like a waste of money . __eou__ i think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . first , it ’ s just like a big party . they can meet each other and network . the other thing is that it is great advertising . all the journalists and photographers are there . thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . __eou__ you meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? __eou__ yes . i think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . in a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . wear what you like ! ’ . __eou__ very philosophical . i think they design these clothes more for publicity . they try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . __eou__ come on . all this fashion has reminded me that i want to buy some clothes .
which service offered by your bank do you use most ? __eou__ i use several services . of course , i deposit and withdraw money quite often . i often use my atm card to take money out of my current account . i use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . i often travel abroad , you see . __eou__ do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? they are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ i sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes i travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? i use direct debit . __eou__ yes , i do . it save me a lot of time . i also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ that ’ s good idea . you don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . i suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ yes . my bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . there ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ i have a deposit account with my bank . there are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ i don ’ t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service . it ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ that ’ s great . but i prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain .
do you think i still fashionable in this dress ? __eou__ i think so . blue is still very fashionable at the moment . __eou__ this style came out last year , though . i like the dress , but i ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . __eou__ i think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . people don ’ t change fashions every year . it would be too expensive . __eou__ yes . only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . __eou__ there are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . __eou__ i wish i could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . i have to limit the amount of money i spend on clothes otherwise i would go on a shopping frenzy . __eou__ i know what you mean . the situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children . the we ’ ll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes !
what ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ? __eou__ i look at myself in the mirror . sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if i have been out late the late before . __eou__ do you usually shower or take a bath ? __eou__ i usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so i just take a shower . sometimes i need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes i need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and i need to warm up . __eou__ do you shave every morning ? __eou__ i shave every workday , but i only shave at weekends if i ’ m going out somewhere . if i ’ m staying at home , i don ’ t shave . __eou__ do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend ? __eou__ yes . i brush my teeth in the morning , just before i go to work . it ’ s actually the last thing i do before leaving . then i brush again before bed . __eou__ your dentist must be proud of you !
so , you friend ’ s getting married on saturday . what have you bought her as a wedding gift . i find is so hard to choose the right gift . __eou__ my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . they have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . the picture are of things they want . people sign their name by the item they will buy . __eou__ that ’ s clever ! then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . what things were in the notebook ? __eou__ most of the things were household appliance . you know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . i think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . __eou__ so , what did you get them ? __eou__ i bought a sewing machine . i know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with it ? __eou__ she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . when she uses it , it makes a funny noise . __eou__ household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . __eou__ i think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most .
i had a big argument with david yesterday . i hope he ’ s not still mad at me . __eou__ what did you argue about ? __eou__ he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn ’ t have the money yet . __eou__ well , he should pay you back . it ’ s only fair . __eou__ yes , but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__ did you lend him a lot of money ? __eou__ not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill , so i needed the money back . __eou__ well , talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it ’ s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? __eou__ no , we didn ’ t . i guess you ’ re right . we should patch things up . __eou__ of course you should . you wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on friday evening ? __eou__ i wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! it ’ s sure to be fun . she ’ s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? __eou__ if everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze , but a few people said that they couldn ’ t go , so i think it should be ok ? __eou__ are you taking anything ? __eou__ i ’ ve got her a birthday present and i ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much . __eou__ helen gets on very well with her neighbours . i wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . __eou__ i ’ m ready looking forward to it . this party is going to be a blast ! __eou__ well , don ’ t be late . i ’ ll see you on friday at helen ’ s .

my goodness ! you ’ re kidding ! __eou__ no . i ’ m serious . i ’ m going to quit my job . __eou__ that ’ s amazing ! you got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? __eou__ it ’ s true . but i can ’ t show my abilities . __eou__ come on ! don ’ t be silly ! __eou__ your present job is something better . why do you change ? __eou__ well . how do you know ?
what's the matter with you ? you look so upset and tired . __eou__ my father failed in business . __eou__ oh , that's really tough . __eou__ maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ i can understand . by the way , is there anyway i can help ? __eou__ no , not now . i have found a part-time job . so perhaps i can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__ oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , i'll always be there . __eou__ thank you .

do you like traveling , kathy ? __eou__ i like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . but i don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... __eou__ or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . __eou__ exactly .

what's that book you have under your arm ? __eou__ it's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . __eou__ how in the world did you get a copy ? i've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i'm still waiting my turn . __eou__ i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day . __eou__ is it really worth paying for ? __eou__ i can't tell yet . i haven't got beyond the first chapter . __eou__ if it's any good , i'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
do you know much about computers ? __eou__ not a great deal . __eou__ i've just been reading an article about them . they'll be used for all sorts of things now . __eou__ for accounting system and things like that , you mean ? __eou__ yes , but they are used for other things , too . do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to paris . __eou__ yes ? __eou__ the man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . a few moment later , he gave us two tickets . __eou__ of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . __eou__ that's right .
well , known , jim , i'm ... i'm pretty much in favour of your computers , i think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . __eou__ but i ... i don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ they can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets . __eou__ that's not the gadgets . creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . it engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
um , which of them is the better typist ? __eou__ well , mary types faster than jones . but i think jones types more carefully . __eou__ is there any difference in their short hand ? __eou__ jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . __eou__ how about languages ? __eou__ both of them speak excellent french . but i think mary speaks german more fluently than jones does . __eou__ um . that doesn ’ t really matter . because we have more french visitors than german .
i ’ ve got a new boss . __eou__ oh , what ’ s he like ? __eou__ well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . __eou__ yes . __eou__ and a white sports car . __eou__ um , that ’ s good . __eou__ yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well .
would you like to come to our party ? __eou__ i'd like to . but i'm not myself today . __eou__ what happened ? you look so pale . __eou__ it's the end of the world for me . __eou__ what makes you say that ? __eou__ today , i'm told i failed three courses . __eou__ oh , that's too bad . work harder next term . __eou__ i'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me . __eou__ don't loose heart . everything will be fine . __eou__ i hope so .
jenny , are you having fun here ? __eou__ yes , of course . this is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . __eou__ i ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . __eou__ thank you for the invitation . __eou__ it ’ s my pleasure . would you like another glass of champagne ? __eou__ yes , please . thank you for everything .
would you like to come out with me tonight ? __eou__ sorry , i can ’ t . __eou__ tomorrow night , then ? __eou__ i ’ d like to . but i ’ m afraid i can ’ t . __eou__ i ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . __eou__ that ’ s sounds great . __eou__ ok . how about give me a ring , then ? __eou__ no . i ’ d better not . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ because i don ’ t think my husband would like it . thank you for inviting me anyway .
is this your new teacher ? __eou__ yes , it is . __eou__ is she short ? __eou__ no , she ’ s average . __eou__ what color are her eyes ? __eou__ they ’ re dark gray . __eou__ what color is her hair ? __eou__ it ’ s blond . __eou__ and how old is she ? __eou__ i don ’ t know .
kate , what do you like to do tonight ? do you often go to the movies ? __eou__ of course . i often go to the movies . __eou__ there ’ s a good movie called summer in beijing . __eou__ i heard it ’ s a very good movie . __eou__ let ’ s find out what time it starts . __eou__ let ’ s look at the newspaper . __eou__ here it is . it starts at 8 o'clock . __eou__ wonderful . i ’ m so excited .
would you like any toast , dear ? __eou__ um ? __eou__ toast , dear ? __eou__ as you like . __eou__ would you like any tea , dear ? __eou__ it doesn ’ t make any difference to me . __eou__ oh , you ’ re not listening to me . __eou__ leave me alone .
alison , would you like to have some more ? __eou__ no thanks . i have had enough . __eou__ actually you haven't have much . __eou__ to tell you the truth , i am on the diet . __eou__ that sounds ridiculous . why ? __eou__ well , i am gaining weight these days , and i have to watch my calories .
i work so hard that i do not have the energy to exercise . __eou__ that is just an excuse . you can always find some time to exercise . __eou__ but i work hard all the time for long hours . often i have no time for lunch . yet , i am still getting fatter . __eou__ bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . and skipping meals will not help you lose weight . in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . __eou__ i know you're right , but what can i do ? __eou__ how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? __eou__ but i'll miss the news . it's important in my business to keep up with events in china . __eou__ i know , i know . have you got a portable radio ? you can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . __eou__ that's a good idea !
how can i lose weight , doctor ? i seem to get fatter even when i just look at food ? __eou__ well , jim . it is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . __eou__ i never eat breakfast though . __eou__ that's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . you will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . __eou__ i never thought about it that way . __eou__ i bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch tv or read a book . then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . __eou__ oh doctor , i feel so foolish . __eou__ well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . __eou__ i know doctor , thank you so much .
ahh ... what a fine day ! i do feel like an outdoor exercise . __eou__ how about taking a walk in the park ? __eou__ ok . it's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . __eou__ oh , it's so quiet here . we have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! __eou__ don't you see many people over there ? just on your left . __eou__ oh , i see them . some are doing taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the chinese wushu . __eou__ a growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over china .
hi bill , i saw your grandma yesterday . __eou__ oh where was that ? __eou__ i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . __eou__ grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . she is always making us kids eat the proper foods . __eou__ well , it pays off for her . how old is she anyway ? __eou__ she will be 86 next month . __eou__ that is truly amazing !
i'm so glad that the spring festival is near at hand . __eou__ me too . i like the festival best of all . __eou__ think of the big face down the eve , hmm . __eou__ and special tv programs , fire crackers and the games to play . __eou__ hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? __eou__ such as ? __eou__ you know why fire crackers are set off in festival . __eou__ why ? to welcome the new year of course ? __eou__ and also to frighten away evil spirits . __eou__ really ? __eou__ and my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . __eou__ oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . they always try to avoid tears and quarrels .
tell me something about your valentine's day . __eou__ ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return . __eou__ so romantic . young people must have lot of fun . __eou__ yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ?
going to the gym tonight , mary ? __eou__ yes , sally . i want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . __eou__ that sounds like fun . would you mind some company ? __eou__ i'd love it . working out is more fun with a friend . __eou__ i'll get my things and meet you there . __eou__ good . if you happen to see jim and bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong .
say , jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ you know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ what do you mean ? it will help us to relax . __eou__ do you really think so ? i don't . it will just make us fat and act silly . remember last time ? __eou__ i guess you are right . but what shall we do ? i don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ i suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ that's a good idea . i hear mary and sally often go there to play singsong . perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ sounds great to me ! if they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . that is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ good . let's go now . __eou__ all right .
hi charles , i want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian . __eou__ you did ? that is great ! __eou__ yeah , i am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? __eou__ no i am free , i will be there , what time the thing starting ? __eou__ around seven . __eou__ ok , great , should i bring anything ? __eou__ no , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? i am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? __eou__ sure , i will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? __eou__ don't worry , i will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty . __eou__ got it .
good morning mike ! __eou__ morning sally ! what's up ? you seem many hurry ! __eou__ i am having an exam at 9 o'clock , it's already 8 thirty . __eou__ don't worry , i'll drive you . __eou__ thank you very much ! __eou__ how are your cases coming along ? __eou__ very well , thanks , i will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , i have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . i can fill in . __eou__ wow , good for you . it sounds like a lot of work . i'm proud of you ! is this the red of building ? __eou__ yes , it's only 8 forty . thanks so much ! __eou__ you're welcome . good luck , bye ! __eou__ have a nice day , bye !
yeah , i ’ ve just moved here , and i ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and i ’ m not sure if i should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan . __eou__ i see . well , can i have a look at your phone ? unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the us , it ’ s not compatible with our 3g network . __eou__ what ? really ? i don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone . __eou__ well , you ’ re in luck ! you see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free . __eou__ really ? what ’ s the catch ? __eou__ there ’ s no catch ! you just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ re giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value forty dollar plan . __eou__ so what does this plan include ? __eou__ well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other tel-mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . oh , and we also offer a rollover option . __eou__ wow , all this for forty dollars per month ? __eou__ that ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ...
do you have any plans for veteran ’ s day ? __eou__ you mean armistice day . __eou__ well , as you know , on november 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the germans , also known as the armistice treaty . this marked the end of wwi and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as remembers ’ day . in poland it ’ s their independence day ! there ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . __eou__ wow , i didn ’ t know ! probably because i flunked history in school .

how do you know ? i thought taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . __eou__ you're right . we're not really into used stuff . __eou__ well , i've grown to like second-hand things . i wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! __eou__ there aren't many places that sell used things in taiwan , besides auction websites . __eou__ i use those sites . hey ! let's go check out a flea market later . __eou__ great ! i can teach you men a thing or two about shopping !
what do you think of this one ? __eou__ eh , so so . __eou__ and this one ? too flashy ? __eou__ nah , not too flashy . __eou__ hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn ’ t it hideous ? __eou__ i guess . __eou__ are you even listening ? i ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . __eou__ and i ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! __eou__ well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon ! __eou__ well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it ’ s the third quarter and you ’ ve been blabbering on since the first ! __eou__ oh , your precious game . you watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! __eou__ oh no you didn ’ t . you didn ’ t just insult the sals-bury seals , did you ? why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? __eou__ i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
excuse me , is this seat taken ? __eou__ no , please feel free . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ do you work in shanghai ? __eou__ yes i do . how about you ? __eou__ no , i'm a tourist . this place is amazing ! it's much bigger than i imagined , and much more exciting ! there's so much to see here . __eou__ you can say that again ! it's much more modern than people imagine . where are you from ? __eou__ um , well let's see ... i'm from kansas originally . a much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure ! __eou__ uh huh ...

here's copellini's , my cousin's store . __eou__ sounds like an italian name with an “ i ” at the end . __eou__ admit it . you just think of mussolini . __eou__ no , i'm an art lover , so i think more of bellini and botticelli ! __eou__ ah , yes . the italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . __eou__ don't we all ... hey ! your cousin sells gift items ? __eou__ yeah-all from italy . see all the saints ? they're important to roman catholics .
welcome ! welcome to little italy . we're the most italian family here ! __eou__ so i've heard . that's why i'm having such a great time . __eou__ if i hadn't married an italian man , i probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . and maybe i could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! __eou__ huh ? um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . __eou__ it is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . ha-ha ... have this . it's from italy !
thank you so much . i can't take this . __eou__ she will insist . it's a rosary . she has millions of them . take it . __eou__ what did she mean just now about raising pigs ? __eou__ oh ! my grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” __eou__ ha-ha . i get it . that's funny . your cousin's a real sarcastic lady . __eou__ she likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly .
holly , i just heard some terrible news . __eou__ me , too . i overheard someone say taylor has a brain tumor . __eou__ what ? no , i heard that he has stomach cancer . his ex-girlfriend said it . __eou__ that could explain all his stomachaches . he's trying to hide it from us . __eou__ maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . have you seen him ? __eou__ no , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . follow me !
is that true ? __eou__ i guess so . now anna's got four kids and another on the way . __eou__ wow . she looks good for having had that many kids . she's pregnant and wearing prada ! __eou__ that's anna for you . she keeps up the image of the stylish italian woman . here she comes . __eou__ she's glowing . it must be the pregnancy . __eou__ yeah , or the expensive italian facial treatments .
who's that ? __eou__ saint jude-he's the saint of lost causes . like my cousin , anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . she's a lost cause . __eou__ is that your cousin in the back ? __eou__ yep . she's always got a bun in the oven . she was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the catholic church . __eou__ what about birth control pills ? don't they work on italians ? __eou__ ha-ha . birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . __eou__ and i heard that italian men have very active libidos .
harry , do you like the opera ? __eou__ no , not really . __eou__ why is that ? it is called real art . __eou__ well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . that kind of gets on my nerves . __eou__ yeah , that makes sense .
what are you two doing in here ? __eou__ we heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . __eou__ i was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . __eou__ who , femi ? yeah , yi-jun saw her inside . __eou__ all these memories of prom night came back to me . i had to be alone . you remember that night ? __eou__ i remember someone spiked my punch . you sat with me in the girl's bathroom ...
i just meant that she's got different taste . __eou__ what kind of girl is she ? __eou__ she's pretty conservative . __eou__ is her fiance taiwanese ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ how old is he ? __eou__ about 30 . he's really outgoing . but why do you ask ?
is it true that rice is the staple food in most of southeast asia ? __eou__ i'm not an expert , but that's the impression i have . __eou__ is rice your staple food , too ? __eou__ needless to say , as a westerner , it's bread .
our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! it's your first chinese new year in taiwan--you must be excited ! __eou__ excited ? what's there to be excited about ? it's just another company dinner , right ? __eou__ you have no idea ! there's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it ! __eou__ really ? what kind of prizes ? __eou__ well , i heard that last year vivian from accounting won a new car ! __eou__ a new car ! you're kidding ! __eou__ no , really ! and she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! __eou__ wear red underwear ? ! does that really work ? are you going to try it ? __eou__ of course ! i'm not only going to wear red underwear , but i'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt , too ! __eou__ gee , i don't think i own any red underwear , but i can buy some !
hey , guys ! __eou__ hi ! nicole ! __eou__ how's business ? __eou__ great . we can't keep up with the demand . __eou__ wow ! i'm impressed ! __eou__ how about you ? __eou__ i quit my job as a food critic . __eou__ then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate .
hey , mary , nice to see you again . i heard you're going back home to the u . s .. __eou__ yes . i'm leaving tomorrow . i came here just because i want to say good-bye to you . __eou__ you're so thoughtful . wish you a good trip home . and we'll miss you . __eou__ i'll miss you too , my friends .
what's going on here ? __eou__ we're waiting in line to get one of master li's chinese couplets . i got one last year and i had good luck all year ! __eou__ master li ? who's that ? __eou__ he's taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! quick ! get in line ! __eou__ i will ! i could use some good luck !
everything is now . i'm kind of sick of it . __eou__ each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band . __eou__ oooh ! one for each of the zeros in 2000 ! wow ! __eou__ stop making fun of me . __eou__ so find a guy to marry and you can get one ! __eou__ i don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring ! __eou__ oh , i see . you're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .
hah ! for three hours while you threw up . and femi dumped me for that . i really loved her . __eou__ i'm so sorry , taylor . go talk to her . i'm sure she'd be happy to see you . __eou__ she probably wouldn't even recognize me . she's probably married . __eou__ yi-jun said femi was talking about you . so get out there , tiger ! __eou__ was she really ? so you're telling me there's a chance ? __eou__ can't hurt to try . carpe diem . who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ?
i'd love that . i'm so glad i quit . it's time for a change . __eou__ does that mean you're going to take my advice ? __eou__ yes . i'm looking for a position as a chef . __eou__ i might be able to help ... __eou__ i'm sure you have great connections . __eou__ we'd like to open another restaurant ... with you as the head chef and manager ... __eou__ really ? you have that much faith in me ? and giovanni agreed to it ? does he know who i am ? __eou__ yes . but you know him . he's just worried that you're not italian ... __eou__ he's prejudiced , isn't he ? __eou__ no . he's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did . __eou__ ah ! i know a way to convince him that americans can make good italian food ! __eou__ how's that ? __eou__ you'll see next week . i'll come by one day at lunchtime .
do you want to hang out tomorrow ? __eou__ oh , i can't . i have a date ! __eou__ really ? wow with who ? __eou__ this girl i've been chatting with for the past couple of months . she's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . __eou__ wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? __eou__ yeah ! i signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! you fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . __eou__ that is kind of weird ! what if she is a psycho or something like that ? __eou__ it's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! i am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! i think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . __eou__ i guess it does seem logical . i'll have to check it out !
congratulations , vivian . you won the grand prize , again . __eou__ isn't it just great ! i just knew i'd win ! __eou__ you did ? how ? did you wear red underwear again this year ? __eou__ not only that ! __eou__ tell me ! tell me ! what's your secret ? ! __eou__ ok , ok . i'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! __eou__ what ? ! you did that ? ? ! ! !
oh , honey . you came . i'm so glad ! why are you wearing a bonnet ? __eou__ uh , just for fun . happy easter , mom . we got you these easter lilies . __eou__ they're beautiful . taylor , you're so pale and skinny ! __eou__ of course i'm pale . it's just now the beginning of spring . i don't have my summer tan yet . __eou__ i guess . are you sure you're taking care of yourself ? __eou__ i'm fine , mom . remember holly ? this is her roommate , yi-jun ..
that's brilliant ! we can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . __eou__ mr . mechanic , i'd like a nice venezuelan blend this morning . __eou__ i think the saudi arabian will hit the spot today . __eou__ but really , maybe this can work . everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . __eou__ a match made in heaven .
i can't believe mr . fro didn't buy it . who does that guy think he is anyway ? bill gates ? __eou__ he had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . __eou__ time to order . balista , today i want a skinny triple latte . __eou__ when did you start worrying about your weight ? __eou__ i'm not . i just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . why ? do you think i'm fat ? __eou__ no , jess , chill out !
balista , pull me a ristretto . __eou__ what ? you're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? what's a ristretto anyway ? __eou__ it's basically a very strong espresso . half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . pure coffee essence . __eou__ sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . i want one of those instead ! __eou__ you fiend . it's about the flavor , not the fix . why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ?
boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . __eou__ easter's a good day for reunions . the family goes to church together . __eou__ and after church they come here for lunch ? __eou__ yup , a big potluck buffet . and then-notice there are no children around ? __eou__ yeah , what's up with that ? __eou__ the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . hide away , yi-jun !
i think i need a new notebook ... __eou__ why ? is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? __eou__ you bet there is . feast your eyes on this puppy ! __eou__ that's a notebook ? __eou__ believe it ! __eou__ it looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase !
hey , lily ! you won't believe what happened in class today ! __eou__ what ? __eou__ a man sent miss smith flowers , and bryan got kicked out of class ! __eou__ cool ! i wish i could have been there ! __eou__ me , too . i miss you . are you any better ? __eou__ yes . but if i have any more soup , i think i'll die .
hide me , yi-jun ! the kids all think i'm the real easter bunny ! __eou__ aw , that's sweet ! i knew your costume would be a success . __eou__ it's a success all right . the kids keep trying to catch me . __eou__ yeah , i saw that . i thought you were playing a game with them . __eou__ some game ! you try being tackled by ten kids at once ! __eou__ um , holly ? look behind you . they're coming this way .
and lots of " dear abby " sob stories ... __eou__ hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! __eou__ no wonder you're such a wacko ... __eou__ whatever ... smell ! perfume samples ! __eou__ nice . hey , i like the layout of this page ... __eou__ you mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... hello ?

mrs . schmidt ! what's happening ! __eou__ you'll never guess what happened today ! i went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... __eou__ and the doctor told you to start listening to bach ? __eou__ no ... he told me i'm pregnant ! __eou__ congratulations ! __eou__ and so i bought all these books on having kids and ... __eou__ and they said you should play classical music ? __eou__ how did you know ! they say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter !
are you ready to go shopping ? __eou__ not yet . i'm not finished with my research yet . __eou__ what research ? __eou__ reading my fashion magazines ! how do you think i know so much about all the latest trends ? __eou__ but they're just ads ... __eou__ duh ... that's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what's in . plus , there are articles on new trends ...
these things are always oooo boring . heard any gossip ? anybody making the big bucks ? __eou__ rich struck it rich in advertising . and he and cath got married and just had a child . __eou__ that's no news . those two were high school sweethearts anyway . __eou__ teresa jones got a boob job . __eou__ uh , i can see that . and erica falls has lost a lot of weight . __eou__ i've got something . you saw taylor smith ? looks terrible , doesn't he ? i heard he ...
look ! there's even a built-in handle to carry it with . __eou__ but it's so thin . there's no way that it comes with a cd-rom . __eou__ oh , yes , it does . look , here it says that the cd-rom is built-in ! __eou__ what other features are listed ? __eou__ it says that it comes in teal and tangerine . __eou__ totally cool colors ! __eou__ and it says that it sleeps .
and the cover is great ! the colors are brilliant ! __eou__ give me a break . you don't care about the colors . you just like the hot babe on the cover . __eou__ ok , you got me . so , do you have a subscription ? __eou__ of course . i'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines . __eou__ so what do you do with all the out-dated issues ? __eou__ i guess i'm lending them to you ...
... i knew it . i always knew you were a lesbian ! __eou__ she's my roommate , not my date . the d-man , as in dork . __eou__ haha . still got that great sense of humor , i see . here's my card . i sell used cars . a car from us is a car you can trust ! __eou__ alrighty then . didn't you use to date sheryl ? __eou__ sweet little lassie . yep , broke her heart when the d-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . __eou__ oh ? i heard she dumped you . anyway , she's right over there . oh , sheryl !
where are we headed now ? __eou__ to a historic coffeehouse . it's got a little mafia story to it . __eou__ awesome . was someone killed there ? __eou__ oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous don . __eou__ cool ! is it safe for us to eat there though ? __eou__ sure . in fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than italians . there are mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat .
are you sure it was him ? __eou__ i used to date him . of course it was him . __eou__ you're a nurse at new york general hospital ? __eou__ yes , on the cancer ward . and taylor was there . he walked right by me and didn't even see me . __eou__ maybe he was just visiting someone . __eou__ but you saw how skinny and pale he looks . he has " cancer patient " written all over his face .
the weekend's finally here ! __eou__ and it's a long one . i have monday off . it's memorial day or something like that . __eou__ yep . it's the kickoff of the barbecue season . we're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow . __eou__ sounds good . what do we need to bring ? __eou__ we need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and i'm making potato salad . __eou__ i'll dig out the frisbee and my kite from taiwan .
taylor , you're sweating up a storm ! __eou__ your boyfriend , bryan , wanted to toss the football . i think he wore me out . __eou__ yeah , you look a little shaky . and pale . you seriously need some time in the sun . __eou__ you're like the tenth person to say that . __eou__ we're just worried about you , taylor . __eou__ whatever . i wish people would just leave me alone !
welcome ! sophia told us you were coming ! __eou__ um ... it's wonderful to be here . uh ... this place looks really cozy . __eou__ thank you ! your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! are you shy ? __eou__ maybe ... __eou__ some of my grappa will cure your shyness . __eou__ is that a kind of alcohol ? __eou__ it's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . you will love it ! __eou__ great . my face will turn even redder !
now the coals are just right . i can start grilling . __eou__ here you go . i made up the burger patties for you . __eou__ thanks . smell the hickory chips ? they give the meat a nice , smoky flavor . __eou__ i'll take over for a while to give you a break . __eou__ sorry . this is a one-man job . i've got the grill just how i like it , and i've made up my own special sauce . __eou__ then i'll tell folks the food's ready . come and get it ! i've always wanted to say that !
does anyone need a drink ? __eou__ i'll take one . how's the cooler situation ? __eou__ it's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . here you are-cheers ! __eou__ cheers . you guys didn't drive , did you ? __eou__ no , we walked . why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? __eou__ no , it's just that it's a holiday . with everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving .
are you going to watch the indy five hundred on tv this weekend ? __eou__ i'm not really into racecar driving . __eou__ you were when we were in high school . that , and baseball . __eou__ yeah , well , times change . look at you-you're a father now . you can't say that you haven't changed . __eou__ true , but i still have to watch my baseball . the season's in full swing now . __eou__ i mean , i know spring training's over , but i'm just not into all that . __eou__ hello ? is the real taylor in there ?
hey , the pool's open now ! __eou__ as of today it is . memorial day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . __eou__ so it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... __eou__ ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . __eou__ not this taiwanese girl . we don't like to get suntans . __eou__ that's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . hey , there's everybody ! we made it !
ok , guys . here's the plan . get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from rich and taylor ! __eou__ why ? are they good ? __eou__ they played ball at school . here we go . yi-jun , go out for a pass ! __eou__ i'm ready ! whoa , what a hard throw ! i can't get that ! __eou__ catch it , yi-jun ! run to the ball ! uh-oh ! slow down , you're going to hit ... __eou__ ummmph !
ok , everyone . gather around . here are the rules . no tackling . no pushing . __eou__ you shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . that's a foul . __eou__ play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . __eou__ you can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . __eou__ the touchdown lines are there and there . ok , let's play ! __eou__ before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
hi , mr . smith . are you enjoying the cookout ? you don't look too happy . __eou__ i spent the morning at the cemetery . i put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies . __eou__ is that what people usually do on memorial day ? __eou__ they should . this holiday is about remembering our war dead . but people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that . thank you for telling me a little more about it .
oh , no . it looks like my computer really has caught a virus . __eou__ why ? did you open an attachment ? __eou__ yes , something called “ george w . bush . ” an hour later , all i see are pictures of george w . bush in women's clothes . __eou__ i kind of like it . he looks better that way , doesn't he ? more presidential . __eou__ i preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys . __eou__ yeah , their expressions were exactly the same !
hey , guys ! did you see that sign ? __eou__ no . what did it say ? __eou__ there's a garage sale around the corner . __eou__ a garage sale ... that's where people check out cars , right ? __eou__ what ? cars ? are you serious ? __eou__ i'm pulling your leg , paul . i'm a shopping queen , remember ? so of course i know what a garage sale is all about !
that's good to know . we'll watch for crazy drivers . __eou__ hey , guys . ready for a pick-up game of touch football ? __eou__ football ? sounds dangerous . maybe i'll just be a cheerleader . __eou__ c'mon , yi-jun . it's lots of fun . you've seen football played on tv . __eou__ uh , yeah . and i've seen guys in pads tackled . we have no pads . i don't want to be tackled . __eou__ there's barely any contact in touch football . people just tag you to stop the play . __eou__ ok , but they better tag lightly !
what a letdown . i wanted to experience some mafia culture firsthand . __eou__ it's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! the five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . __eou__ such a thing exists ? __eou__ fortunately , yes . you're blushing ! __eou__ am i ? um ... my face gets red when i walk too fast . __eou__ you're embarrassed , aren't you ? you gotta loosen up in little italy . the lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ...
he's only interested in harassing you . how can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? __eou__ i almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . __eou__ as obnoxious as bean is , we should still try to finish this case . __eou__ true-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? __eou__ yeah ! remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth ?
wanna chill out and watch cable ? __eou__ wow ! besides the cosby show , i've never seen a black sitcom . what's this program ? __eou__ it's a drama called soul food . this channel is bet-black entertainment television . it has black shows , news and commercials . __eou__ this show is like a black friends . __eou__ bet has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white tv . __eou__ that's cool . i've heard la has an all-asian channel on cable .
here's some dancing . see those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? they're practicing step-dancing . __eou__ it sounds cool . the rhythms look really difficult . __eou__ they basically turn their bodies into drums . there's a national step competition every year . __eou__ well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . __eou__ wen ! that's only a stereotype . like all asians are supposed to be math geniuses . i'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . __eou__ ha-ha ! you got me there !
don't open any of my forwards ! i got a virus ! __eou__ don't tell me you got the dreaded bush virus . i've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world . __eou__ yes , that's exactly the bug i got . though , i do kind of like the pictures . __eou__ those clothes do suit him better . __eou__ wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ? __eou__ probably not . it's off the internet . what difference does it make ?
i've never met anyone like clyde before . __eou__ he's such a buppie-a black yuppie . black people come in all shapes and sizes . just check out the party . __eou__ wow ! there are so many different people here . i expected mostly athletes and rappers . __eou__ you'll find some of those here , too . but not if you don't shake it up ! there's an african saying , “ if you can talk , you can sing ! if you can walk , you can dance ! ” __eou__ then i'll just shut up and sit down !
what have you been up to , johnny ? __eou__ you know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... __eou__ wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? __eou__ you got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . __eou__ you have all the fun , don't you ? __eou__ listen , i'd better get back to the grindstone . __eou__ sure thing , johnny . watch out for dishpan hands there , kid !
oh dear , miss , you are soaked ! wow , it's really raining heavily outside . __eou__ yes , it sure is . i had to run here from work ! i need to rush as i'm on my lunch break . __eou__ well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? i'm in no hurry . __eou__ oh , that's so nice of you ! thank you very much . __eou__ my pleasure miss . actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? i've never been here before . __eou__ sure . well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . personally , i think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . i usually get that . also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! __eou__ well , thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ oh , don't mention it .
i can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard i try and i have been here for 2 years already ! __eou__ well , have you thought of getting an mba ? i heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . __eou__ an mba , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . __eou__ nonsense ! the business schools measure your ability through a test called gmat . __eou__ gmat ? what does that stand for and what will the test contain ? __eou__ graduate management admission test , it contains three parts __eou__ okay , this sounds a little tough , how am i supposed to practice for this ? __eou__ up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . going to church might help as well ! __eou__ no matter what i do , i'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat ! __eou__ umm . . . that's the spirit !
hi , michelle . do you need to use the photocopier ? __eou__ oh , hi jeremy . no please , go ahead . so how are you , jeremy ? i was talking to linda about you only last week . __eou__ oh , i'm fine , thanks . i'm super busy with work actually . did you hear about the lawson contract ? __eou__ no , tell me more . __eou__ well , i was discussing the contract with bill and he said that they met the head of lawsons last week . __eou__ and . __eou__ and hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on wednesday , fingers crossed . __eou__ that's great news , jeremy . congratulations ! anyway , i must get back , but give my regards to your wife monica . __eou__ i will , michelle . speak to you soon .
let ' s got out tomorrow night . we can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . __eou__ i don ' t think that ' s a good idea . i am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . __eou__ maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . __eou__ pick-up lines don ' t work ! __eou__ come on ! you can just walk up to a girl and say “ if you were a booger i \ ' d pick you first . ” __eou__ what ? come on ! that ’ s just lame ! no girl would fall for that ! __eou__ fine , then you can say , “ so there you are ! i ' ve been looking all over for you , the woman of my dreams ! ” __eou__ that ' s a good one ! i think that ' s pretty funny . __eou__ yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . __eou__ ok , how does this sound , “ i was so enchanted by your beauty that i ran into that wall over there . so i am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” __eou__ nice ! let ' s go !
you want to go to the movies tonight ? __eou__ sure ! what ' s playing ? __eou__ the new twilight movie ! __eou__ twilight ? as in the vampire movies ? no way , i am watching that , but i don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . it doesn ' t make sense . __eou__ of course it does . it ' s like a modern tale of romeo and juliet . you can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . and in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . __eou__ i don ' t buy into that . i think it ' s just a fad . pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies !
i have made up my mind . i am getting a tattoo . __eou__ really ? are you sure ? __eou__ yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that , i have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ really ? __eou__ of course ! they use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ oh , i didn ’ t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
are you excited about your trip next month ? __eou__ yes and no . i can ' t wait to go to europe , but at the same time i am terrified . __eou__ why ? __eou__ well , i have acrophobia . i have a chronic fear of flying . __eou__ oh really ? i have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . it ' s not that bad though , i mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . i actually have arachnophobia . __eou__ you ' re scared of spiders ? i actually have two more phobias . acrophobia and glossophobia . __eou__ i guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . __eou__ are you kidding ? when i get on stage , my palms start to sweat , i get really nervous and i can hardly speak . __eou__ well , i must confess i am a bit claustrophobic . i hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . __eou__ we are such weirdos right ?
the air conditioning is not working ! we need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! __eou__ dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . __eou__ that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it ’ s really annoying ! __eou__ yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__ i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
hey nick , what are you up to ? __eou__ not much , just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ? __eou__ seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don ’ t know man . __eou__ yeah , it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim . __eou__ yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__ whoa , take it easy there rambo . don ’ t get carried away . these weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . for example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! __eou__ wow , i didn ’ t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! __eou__ the reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ? __eou__ let ’ s do it !
hey lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ i ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that i will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ what are you talking about ? let me see that ... what are horoscopes ? __eou__ it ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th , so i ’ m an aries . when were you born ? __eou__ january 5th . __eou__ let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ that ’ s bogus . i don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ no , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ? __eou__ a capricorn is serious-minded and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
let ’ s play a game ! __eou__ ok ! how about scrabble ? __eou__ no , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! __eou__ ok ! __eou__ let ’ s see . he has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! __eou__ our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok , my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ your future husband ! __eou__ not funny .
what are you doing ? __eou__ what am i doing ? what am i doing ? don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__ mumm . no . __eou__ it ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . __eou__ what ? __eou__ the world cup ! the first match is today ! it ’ s mexico vs . south africa ! it ’ s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . __eou__ i have no idea what you ’ re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl . __eou__ this is bigger than the super bowl , man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . the top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . __eou__ sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . so far brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! __eou__ all i know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ whatever dude , i ’ m going to go watch the opening match .
hey ! how was your first day of class ? i ’ m in level two and i ’ m loving my class this semester ! it ’ s great being in a class of international students ! __eou__ mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks english . i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester . __eou__ that ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . it ’ s the united nations in my class ! we have people from all over the world ! there are three germans , a pole , a scottish , two french , an american , a brazilian , a chilean , a new zealander , though he prefers to call himself a kiwi . who else do we have ? oh , we also have a moroccan , a togolese , a pakistani , and two indonesians ! __eou__ that ’ s quite the array of nationalities . everyone in my class is from asia , except me . there are a few south koreans , several japanese , malaysian , thai , singaporean , filipino , kazakhstan , and one russian . __eou__ well , i think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . you ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture . __eou__ i guess so , but i think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . i think i might change classes . __eou__ don ’ t ! stay the course ! your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful . i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . __eou__ i highly doubt it . your girlfriend is chinese . __eou__ well , there is that , yes .
oh , george , what a beautiful day it is today ! the sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! what a perfect day to be at the beach ! the kids are going to have so much fun ! and we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . __eou__ it does seem like the perfect day ! i ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up camp . here , mary , help me lay down these beach towels . __eou__ there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect . __eou__ ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a frisbee , a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . don ’ t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . __eou__ and stay in the shallow area . i don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ you ’ re back already ? the water was too cold , huh ? i ’ ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ’ ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . __eou__ what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy , put that down right now ! it could sting you ! __eou__ ah ! not on me ! ow !
trina , will you marry me ? __eou__ yes ! yes ! and yes ! jared , of course i ’ ll marry you ! __eou__ oh , babe , i can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! i can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . i can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . __eou__ oh , jared ! i can ’ t wait for our wedding ! i hope you don ’ t mind , but i ’ ve already chosen a date ! six months from now in the summer ! melissa saw you buying the ring last month so i ’ ve had plenty of time to start planning ! __eou__ she what ? __eou__ oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , i didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . it was still a nice surprise ! as i was saying , i ’ ve got it all planned out . there ’ s almost nothing left to do ! i wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . __eou__ four hundred ? __eou__ no need to sweat it . my parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . so roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at northwoods heights will be our reception venue . i thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . we ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . the music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . my step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . my cousin will be the official photographer . i thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? __eou__ ah ... __eou__ and then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the youth group to serve us . i was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . or we could hire a dj . your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? i was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like aquamarine . and there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! what do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? who else am i missing ? oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! __eou__ wow . __eou__ see ? it ’ s going to be wonderful ! oh this wedding is going to be everything i ever dreamed of . __eou__ if i survive the next six months .
joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? __eou__ fine with me . i just want to get this over with . it ’ s important we make a clean break . i should have signed a pre-nup . __eou__ what was that ? __eou__ nothing ! anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . my lawyer tells me you ’ ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-i keep the cat and you get the dog . so that ’ s done ... finally . __eou__ let ’ s not go there , joanne ! ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , i ’ ll take the albums i contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . __eou__ fine , but i ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . __eou__ i believe that was a wedding present to both of us , joanne . and you hardly ever use it ! __eou__ he ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__ whatever ! alright , i ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that i get the silver tea set . __eou__ how typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? fine ! i don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . what ’ s next ? what about these old photographs ? __eou__ which ones ? let me have a look . wow , look at that ! that brings back memories ... that ? __eou__ our trip to italy ! i remember that day . we were going to visit the trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... __eou__ ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . i had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... __eou__ oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__ oh , joanne , are we making a big mistake ? i know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? i still love you . __eou__ oh jeff ! i love you too ! i ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__ the motorcycle ? but that ’ s mine !
woo hoo ! this just might be the start of the rest of my life ! __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ i ’ m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . i ’ ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so i can address the letters personally . and you know i can be charming in interviews . goodbye my penniless days ! hello salary and a career ! __eou__ ben , we ’ re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . __eou__ uh-huh . __eou__ but i ’ m just in it for the money , right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides , i love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ?
now that it ’ s the new year , i ’ ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ you got it ! i have a new job , i ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life . __eou__ so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ? __eou__ well , first of all , i ’ ve decided to stop smoking . it ’ s not that i ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that i ’ ve been smoking since i was sixteen , and i think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ i ’ m with you on that one . anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ one last thing , i ’ ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ it ’ s about time !
bill . bill ! you gotta help me ! __eou__ what ’ s wrong ? slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ tomorrow is christmas and i haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! i ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ take it easy ! let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ that ’ s just it ! i don ’ t know what to get her ! last year i got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! i suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ that ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! you can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! especially with clothes or jewelry . on top of that , i think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . at the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ yeah , you ’ re right . when it comes down to it , i can be pretty tacky . __eou__ yeah , tell me about it . i know ! your mom is trying to learn spanish , right ? why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website i saw called spanishpod . __eou__ now that ’ s a great idea !
i ’ ve had it ! i ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! __eou__ so what are you gonna do ? just quit ? __eou__ that ’ s exactly what i am going to do ! i ’ ve decided to create my own company ! i ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! __eou__ have you ever written up a business plan before ? __eou__ well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? __eou__ you couldn ’ t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . __eou__ well , that seems easy enough . __eou__ wait , there ’ s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? then comes the hard part , a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has ! all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . __eou__ geez . is that all ? __eou__ almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . after all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! __eou__ umm . i think i ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? __eou__ what ? why do we have to do that ? __eou__ well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__ i see . that ’ s convenient ! i never understood things like this , such as gmt . i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__ that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ? well , then we were in china standard time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of greenwich ! __eou__ that ’ s why it was so weird traveling from beijing to la ! because of the huge time difference , even though we left beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in la the same day at noon ! it ’ s like we went back in time !
mark . where have you been ? i ’ ve been calling you all morning . __eou__ i ’ ve been playing computer games . __eou__ what ? so you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? what game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? what are you playing ? __eou__ it ’ s called counter strike . it ’ s a first person shooter game . it ’ s awesome . it ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . __eou__ you ’ ve been wasting your time on this ? i can ’ t believe it ! it doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! __eou__ my laptop is on my bed . if you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . __eou__ fine ! __eou__ damp it ! how are you killing me with a single shot ? it ’ s not fair ! i don ’ t want to play anymore ! let ’ s go get something to eat . __eou__ can you bring me something ? i am totally hooked on this game !
hi honey ! you ’ ll never guess what ! my friends julie and alex are getting married ! __eou__ wow that ’ s great news ! they ’ re a great couple ! __eou__ i know ! anyways i just talked to alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party it ’ s gonna be so much fun ! all the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ you aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? i don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ aw come on ! it ’ s just some innocent fun ! you know how these things are ! we are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . nothing too over the top . __eou__ well , i don ’ t know . __eou__ come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! __eou__ good , because my friend wendy is getting married and i ’ m organizing her party !
man , i ’ m freaking out ! you gotta help me ! __eou__ whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! what ’ s going on ? __eou__ i can ’ t go through with this ! i just can ’ t ! i ’ m not ready for marriage ! what was i thinking ? i ’ m only thirty five years old ! i ’ ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! i can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__ what are you talking about ? it wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__ i know . i know ! __eou__ let ’ s think this through . first of all , you cannot leave amy at the altar . not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? second of all , you are just getting cold feet . you know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! __eou__ you ’ re right . i ’ m being crazy ! ok , i ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__ great ! phew ! that was a close one ! you had me going there for a minute i thought i was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
are you ok ? you seem a bit anxious . __eou__ yeah , i'm ok , i have been having a lot of mood swings lately . i think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones . __eou__ so you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? __eou__ yeah , it's weird . for example just this morning i was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . __eou__ well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! __eou__ i hope you are right .
have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! then they are sold on the black market . __eou__ don't tell me you actually believe all that ? don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . they are just stories people make up to scare you . __eou__ well , i was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! can you believe that ? __eou__ you really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? don't be so naive ! __eou__ well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how kfc has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! __eou__ sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ?
oh man ! i ’ ve been starving myself for days now and i haven ’ t lost an ounce ! __eou__ are you trying to lose weight ? __eou__ yeah , my friend is getting married next month and i ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . i have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but i haven ’ t lost any weight ! look at these love handles . __eou__ you don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . i think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . __eou__ why ? if i eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? __eou__ not really . you should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . __eou__ so you are saying that i should eat , but i should just watch what i eat ? __eou__ yes ! you can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . you can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . __eou__ if i do all this do you think i can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? __eou__ don ’ t count on it .
did you read this ? it says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ why would that be funny ? __eou__ well , think about it . we are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ why ? __eou__ we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ i don ’ t agree , but anyways , i think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ what ’ s the point ? we always make a new year ’ s resolution and by february we will have forgotten about it . it ’ s pointless . __eou__ well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ what about you ? your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ well , i would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ yeah , yeah , whatever .
it's almost midnight ! we are about to start a brand new year ! __eou__ i know it's so exciting ! a new year is always like a clean slate . fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . __eou__ do you have a new year's resolution ? __eou__ i was thinking about it , but i'm never able to keep my new year's resolution . last year for example i joined a gym and only went twice . __eou__ yeah i know what you mean . that's why this year i am keeping things more simple . maybe like getting together with friends i haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . __eou__ that seems reasonable . we should get together and watch the ball drop in times square . __eou__ sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! __eou__ well , we can't break tradition ! it's bad luck !
what are you doing , awake ? __eou__ i can't sleep ... __eou__ but it's almost midnight ! __eou__ exactly . i'm too excited for christmas morning . also , i thought i heard santa . __eou__ really ? how do you know it was santa ? __eou__ well , i heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so i thought i'd be nice and make santa cookies . i even left out some milk . i heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so i came downstairs ! __eou__ hmm ... well i know that santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! __eou__ really ? __eou__ really ! let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . that way , we can let santa do his job . then when you wake up , it will be christmas already ! __eou__ o-k ... __eou__ hey , honey ! is that you ? don't eat all the cookies — i want some , too !
look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . it says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months ! __eou__ you don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ? __eou__ well , i have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! __eou__ of course it does ! they tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . i think most of the times they are just scam artists . __eou__ well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes . __eou__ all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
hey michelle , jump in quick . it's pouring out there ! __eou__ oh , hi melissa . are you going to the conference too ? i was planning to pick up mr . campbell . __eou__ yes , he told me . we need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference . __eou__ oh i see , okay . so i heard you got married . congratulations ! __eou__ ah thank you ! i'm very excited . we were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . it was wonderful . __eou__ that sounds so romantic ! jack and i were hoping to get married in europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . we just don't have the money ! __eou__ i know what you mean . i think shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ? __eou__ i sure do . in my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home . __eou__ definitely . oh , there's mr . campbell . driver , can you stop here please ?
honey , i ’ ll be right back ! __eou__ where are you going ? __eou__ i told you already ! i ’ m going to get my nails done . __eou__ again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? __eou__ well , first of all , i like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . you should come with me ! __eou__ why ? i don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! __eou__ they don ’ t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! __eou__ yeah , sounds like something i should definitely do .
hey michelle . good to see you . are you at lunch ? __eou__ oh hi jim . no i just got back . i thought you were on vacation now . __eou__ no , i wish i was ! i just got back from spain actually . __eou__ oh wonderful ! have you been there before or was it your first time ? __eou__ my first time . i've traveled around europe a lot , but this was my first time to spain . it was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! no rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... __eou__ i'm so jealous of you . i've never been anywhere in europe . i've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . __eou__ well , i really recommend spain . you really should go . anyway , it's been great to catch up , but i must be going , this is my floor . speak again soon i hope .
ah , michelle , hi . i was hoping to see you . how have you been ? how's the family ? __eou__ oh , hello , mr . campbell . i'm fine and jack's doing well . how are you ? __eou__ i'm fine thanks . i got your report this morning . thank's for that . are you joining the conference today ? __eou__ yes , i'm leaving at four pm . __eou__ good , well we can discuss this more then , but i think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . __eou__ yes , me too . __eou__ i'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . i don't think we should continue with the tv advertising .
so what are you doing for thanksgiving ? __eou__ not much really . it's more of an american tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . in fact , i am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! __eou__ well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! __eou__ yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? __eou__ well , the first settlers of massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from england and king james . once in the new world , they befriended an native named squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . __eou__ and then what did happen ? __eou__ well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 they decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . __eou__ interesting ! i am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! __eou__ come to my house for thanksgiving ! we are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__ count me in !
tom ! how are you ? we missed you at the party last night . are you ok ? __eou__ i don ’ t know . i didn ’ t really feel like going out . i guess i ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__ come on . we ’ ve been through this already ! look , i know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__ i was . it ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and i won ’ t be able to home because i can ’ t afford the airfare . i ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . when i first got here , i ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . i almost let it get to me , but then i started going out , keeping myself busy and before i knew it , i was used to to it . __eou__ i see what you mean , but i ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ ok . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . i hear that an awesome dj is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! __eou__ you know , i could really go for that . you don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? __eou__ not at all ! it be fun ! it will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... __eou__ great ! i must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture !
this is the good life ! we have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__ yeah of course ! although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ well , sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ like for example , if i hadn ’ t studied architecture , i would have become an artist like i wanted to . __eou__ i see . yeah now that i think of it , i wouldn ’ t have gotten married if i hadn ’ t moved to this town and met sally . __eou__ you see ! everything happens for a reason ! we wouldn ’ t even have met if i hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__ well , i have no regrets ! __eou__ i ’ ll drink to that !
did you hear ? the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me . __eou__ what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ? __eou__ well , to begin with , gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ geez ! now that i think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! although , i have been to las vegas , and i didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me , i have a protest rally to organize !
you should have seen the t . v . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ do you really believe in that ? if they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ i understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . if so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ you can ’ t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ well , you are right on that point . this is the reason that i don ’ t buy leather and i try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ at least you ’ re doing your part . my contribution is to have a pet in the house that i treat like a member of the family . __eou__ as long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine .
i ’ m forming a music band . __eou__ do you already know how to play an instrument ? __eou__ uh ... yeah ! i ’ ve told you a thousand times that i ’ m learning to play the drums . now that i know how to play well , i would like to form a rock band . __eou__ aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? __eou__ we have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . you told me that you had some musical talent , right ? __eou__ yes , i ’ m a singer . __eou__ perfect . so you can audition this weekend here at my house . __eou__ great ! wait here ? you don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! by the way where do you keep them or practice ?
ok ... i ’ ll talk to you later . bye __eou__ carrie , are you ok ? you seem a bit down . __eou__ i just got off the phone with my boyfriend . he is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . it ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . __eou__ maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . he does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . __eou__ yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . i try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . __eou__ men are like that you know.they can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . __eou__ i guess you are right . what do you think i should do ? he wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... __eou__ talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , i say get rid of him and get a new one ! __eou__ you are something else you know that ?
tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or-treating ? __eou__ what are you talking about ? where is your halloween spirit ? didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? __eou__ of course , i did , but when i was ten ! trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , i ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids ncp at night . __eou__ whatever , i ’ m going next door i heard mrs . robinson is giving out big bags of m & ms !
wow , that terrible movie is finally over . next time i ’ m picking the film , because i don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . __eou__ well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . __eou__ not everything , just this film . even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that i ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . __eou__ i ’ m thinking of taking you back home . i thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . __eou__ i ’ m only complaining about a movie that i could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . __eou__ you see , that ’ s what i ’ m talking about , i can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore . __eou__ next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . __eou__ well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . __eou__ love stories ? more like one-night-stands . __eou__ don ’ t criticize mario or else i ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints . __eou__ my friends ? fat ? what about those whales you call friends ? __eou__ you ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , i ’ m leaving .
honey , do you have a second ? __eou__ sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried.what ’ s on your mind ? __eou__ we need to talk . __eou__ okay ... __eou__ i ’ ve been thinking , and well , i think we need to start seeing other people . __eou__ what ? why ? i mean , we ’ ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ that ’ s just it , i ’ m not happy anymore , tim . it ’ s not you , it ’ s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! __eou__ so , what are you saying ? you ’ re breaking up with me because i ’ m perfect ? __eou__ tim , you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh , i could say that i ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . i know i ’ d only hurt you , i know i ’ d only make you cry . __eou__ baby , come on . don ’ t do this to me ! whatever it is , we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! don ’ t leave me . __eou__ i can ’ t , tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i ’ m only doing this for you . i don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do . __eou__ laura ... __eou__ here are your keys . i ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i ’ m sorry , tim . i wish you all the best , and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ’ ll always love you . goodbye .
hey man ! how ’ s it hanging ? __eou__ hey man ! everything is just groovy baby ! __eou__ did you go to the roller rink on saturday ? i heard it was far out , man ! __eou__ i wanted to , but i ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! i was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . __eou__ right on , right on ! well , jim went to the rink with sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! he was low on bread , but sherry paid for everything . __eou__ gravy ! jim is such a jive turkey man . he is always hitting me up for cash . anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? __eou__ yeah man , i ’ m starving !
alright everyone settle down . let ’ s get started.as you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . it is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . this brings me to our topic for today . does anyone know what we celebrate on may first ? __eou__ cinct de mayo ? __eou__ no , that ’ s may fifth in spanish , james , no wonder you are failing my spanish class . no , may first is international workers ’ day . __eou__ do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ no ! it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the us , but in other countries it is . __eou__ www , man ! __eou__ in the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by april 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the may day movement . previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . they passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . and , on may first 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__ cool ! is that why we only work eight hours now ? __eou__ yes ! but the happy ending came at a high price.on may third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the mccormick reaper works factory , killing four and wounding many . a mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . __eou__ and then what happened ? __eou__ well , as we say , the rest is history ...
okay , next question . if eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? __eou__ duh ! i would say yes ! eric is the most popular kid in school ! okay , my turn . what would you do if you won the lottery ? __eou__ let ’ s see ... if i won the lottery , i would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . __eou__ if you buy me a ticket i will go with you for sure ! __eou__ my dad will freak out if i even mention a trip like that ! __eou__ alright this is a good one . what would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? __eou__ if i told her that , she would faint and have me committed !
what ’ s up ? you don ’ t look too good . __eou__ yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . i ’ ve been in physics class all day . it ’ s killer ! __eou__ i liked physics . it ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ a physics class about the creation of the universe ? that ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . sounds more religious to me . __eou__ it ’ s all religion . take the theory of the big bang.how is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? that ’ s no better than atlas carrying the globe on his back or african myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ turtles ? whatever ... look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . at least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ math , sheath . what ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ there is evidence ! you know edwin hubble ? he ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . what would it be expanding from ? well , the big bang ... duh ! __eou__ anyway , it ’ s just a theory . why do people go around touting theories ? where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ dude , don ’ t equivocate . a theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . you slept through class , didn ’ t you ?
where to , miss ? __eou__ hi ! crenshaw and hawthorne , at the holiday inn that is on that corner . __eou__ sure thing . so , where are you flying in from ? __eou__ from china . __eou__ really ? you don ’ t look very chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . __eou__ it ’ s fine . i am actually from mexico . i was in china on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . __eou__ wow sounds interesting ! excuse me if i am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? __eou__ don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? __eou__ don ’ t get me wrong ! it ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! __eou__ well thank you ! in that case , i am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? __eou__ i am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old u . s of a , although i have some colombian heritage . __eou__ really ? that ’ s great ! do you speak some spanish ? __eou__ uh ... yeah .. of course ! __eou__ que bien ! sentences poems habeas en espanol !
can we talk ? __eou__ sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ you know what i mean . __eou__ yeah . i know . __eou__ i want to know where this relationship is going . i ’ m in love with you and i need to know ... __eou__ you know , i think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ i ’ m awesome . well , i guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . __eou__ honey ... __eou__ look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ ve had our laughs , but i don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... __eou__ baby , i love you so much . __eou__ you do ? __eou__ i love you . and i think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ oh , i love you too ! __eou__ come on . put the gun down . __eou__ oh baby , i ’ m so sorry .

i heard you were on a date last night ! so , how did it go ? i want all the juicy details ! __eou__ um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . he was ... amazing ! __eou__ okay , now you really have to fill me in . what ’ s he like ? __eou__ he ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... __eou__ he sounds hot ! what does he do for a living ? __eou__ you know what , this is the best part . david is a junior investment banker at fortune bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! __eou__ hold on a sec , his name is david ? __eou__ yeah ? __eou__ that ’ s my brother !
so , did i tell you about my new year ’ s resolution ? i ’ ve decided to go on a diet . __eou__ and you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? __eou__ exactly ! i ’ m going to cut out all that junk i eat , no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . __eou__ i ’ ve heard this one before . __eou__ but this time i ’ m going to stick to it . i really mean it ! trust me , carol , i ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! __eou__ well , i guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . __eou__ thanks , honey , that was a great meal . i ’ m stuffed . do we have any chips left ?
has the game started yet ? __eou__ yeah , about 5 minutes ago . __eou__ who's winning ? __eou__ the bulls , of course ! __eou__ what ! that wasn't a foul ! c ’ mon , ref ! __eou__ don ’ t worry , shan always screws up free throws . __eou__ you were right ! he didn ’ t make the shot ! __eou__ that was a great shot ! a three pointer , yeah ! __eou__ did you see that ? he traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! __eou__ this ref needs glasses . hey ref , open your eyes ! i can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! __eou__ okay ... end of the first quarter ... alright , i ’ m gonna make a beer run .
nick ! how ’ s it going ? __eou__ oh , hey ... __eou__ what are you doing in this neighbourhood ? do you live around here ? __eou__ actually , my office is right around the corner . __eou__ it was great to meet you last week at the conference . i really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . __eou__ yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . you know , i'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . we should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . __eou__ sure , you still have my contact details , right ? __eou__ you know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . can you remind me ? __eou__ sure , my name is ana ferris . don ’ t worry about it , it happens to me all the time . i ’ m terrible with names too .
dad , i ’ d like to borrow some money . __eou__ sure , johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? __eou__ come on , dad , i need thirty thousand . i wanna get into the market . you know , i ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . i look at this as an opportunity . this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__ i don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there ’ s just too much instability . i wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . __eou__ but look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . and anyway , i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . there are emerging markets that promise great returns . look at china , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . __eou__ come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . __eou__ fine , then ! if that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . but you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . i ’ m going to go hit up mum for the cash .
i can ’ t believe that anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__ yeah well it ’ s about time ! he ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__ don ’ t be mean . look here come the bridesmaids ! their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__ who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__ that ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . oh , they look so cute ! __eou__ i just hope the priest makes it quick . i ’ m starving . i hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__ that ’ s all you ever think about , food ! oh , i think the bride ’ s coming now ! she looks gorgeous . wait , what ’ s she doing ? where ’ s she going ? __eou__ oh great ! does this mean that the reception is canceled ?
this is the first time for me to have a chinese guest . i hope you like western cooking . __eou__ yes . i like it very much . __eou__ cooking is a hobby with me . i'm always trying to think up new recipes . i hope you like the soup . it's kind of a specialty of mine , so i hope you enjoy it . __eou__ it's excellent . __eou__ thank you for your compliment . won't you try this fish with white sauce ? i'm rather round of it . __eou__ it's delicious . __eou__ what sort of western food do you like best ? __eou__ i like beefsteak very much . have you tried chinese dishes ? __eou__ i find the chinese dishes wonderful . __eou__ well , it's getting late . i have to get up early tomorrow . so i must say good night . __eou__ it's still early .
good morning , mary ! __eou__ good morning , john ! __eou__ i want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . would you be able to come the next weekend on saturday ? __eou__ i'd be delighted to , john . saturday did you say ? __eou__ yes , if that's all right for you . __eou__ i'm pretty sure i'll be all right . in fact , i'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . what time are you planning to start ? __eou__ oh , good . if you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . __eou__ that sounds fine . i'll be there around seven .
i've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ i fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . i'm really sorry . __eou__ don't worry about it . it's not new , it already has a few scratches . did you get hurt ? __eou__ no , thank you . __eou__ that's the most important thing . __eou__ it's kind of you to say . i feel a little stupid . __eou__ forget about it . __eou__ when you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . __eou__ maybe , but really i have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . __eou__ i appreciate that , thank you .
jane , i was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . __eou__ a friend and i are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? __eou__ there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , i was hoping you ' d like to come with me . __eou__ i am afraid i can't i am going to be out all day . __eou__ what about sunday ? __eou__ i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday . __eou__ maybe next week . __eou__ much as i ' d like to , i am afraid i wont be free next week , i have a lot of work . __eou__ sorry to hear that , i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , i really enjoyed our last chat . __eou__ i am really sorry too , maybe i can give you a call sometime .
i heard that ben is forming his own band . __eou__ it will be a rock and roll band probably . he ’ s a very good guitarist . __eou__ can you play a musical instrument ? if you can , he might ask you to join the band . __eou__ i can play drums , but i haven ’ t played for a while . i ’ m not sure i ’ d be good enough to play in a band . __eou__ i wish i could play a musical instrument . i love music . __eou__ nowadays , you can be a dj . you can mix dance music . you don't need to be able to play music instrument or thing . __eou__ i love to try it , but the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice . __eou__ you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . you already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . __eou__ that ’ s a great idea . i ’ ll search for some information on the internet . if it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it .
something wrong ? __eou__ yes . my car is having problems . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ it won't start . __eou__ do you want me to take a look ? __eou__ no , thank you . i think i can handle it . __eou__ well , if you change your mind , let me know . __eou__ i will . thanks . that's sweet of you . __eou__ no problem . __eou__ i might need some tools though . do you know where i can get some ? __eou__ sure . i have all kinds of tools . just ask . i ’ ll be happy to get them for you . __eou__ thanks . that would be very helpful . __eou__ anything for you . seriously , i don ’ t mind helping . __eou__ ok . if you really insist , i could always use the company .
hello , kevin . i hate to do this , but i have to cancel our appointment . __eou__ oh , no ! why ? i was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . __eou__ yeah , i really wanted to come , too . but something unexpected in shanghai have come up . i have to fly out for a few days , but i'll be back soon . __eou__ no problem . call me when you get back . __eou__ i should have some free time next week . say , next wednesday evening ? __eou__ that's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? i'd really like to see you . __eou__ yeah , i'm expecting to come back on tuesday . __eou__ great ! that's settled then . __eou__ ok .
hi , alice , what are you doing this sunday ? __eou__ nothing really , why , what ' s up ? __eou__ if you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun , you will get to know lots of people . __eou__ sounds great , i'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ? __eou__ around six pm . __eou__ do you need help setting up or anything ? i don't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it's fun and i have a good eye for decorating . __eou__ no . thank you . i can handle it , but thanks for the offer . __eou__ ok , i will see you then . __eou__ great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
hi rose , what are you busy with right now ? __eou__ hi jack , i'm working on these documents . the manager wants them for half an hour . __eou__ well , rose . __eou__ is there something any need ? __eou__ are your free this weekend ? __eou__ yes , i have nothing to do . __eou__ great , is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? __eou__ i beg your pardon ? __eou__ i'd like to call on you this weekend . i just want to a drop in for a chat . __eou__ really ? well , ok , you're welcome . __eou__ is 5 pm . saturday a good time for you ? __eou__ hmm , how about seven ? i can treat you to dinner . __eou__ sure , that would be great . i'll bring the wine . __eou__ ok . then i'll be expecting you . __eou__ i'll be there on time .
what kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ i like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . you know , i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it's too loud though . you prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , i do . i find it very relaxing . i often listen to mozart or bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ i must admit that i like several pieces of classical music . it ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . research suggest that it makes your brain more active . students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ really ? perhaps i should listen to classical music often . i heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ yes . that ’ s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ i ’ ve got a few classical music cd ’ s . i should follow your lead and increase my brian power . __eou__ you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . you can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ that ’ s true . there ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character .
are you ready to go to the bank ? __eou__ sure , what do you need to do there ? __eou__ there ’ s problem with my bank statement . there ’ s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money some the atm . __eou__ i have to exchange some money . __eou__ that ’ s right . you ’ re going away next week . __eou__ i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week . __eou__ i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__ their interest rates are usually quite high . it ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
i heard that janet has got a new job . she ’ s working for the united investment group . i heard that they pay very well . __eou__ i heard that too . she must be making a pocket . well , good for her . __eou__ now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . __eou__ yes , she will . at the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . __eou__ you ’ re right . by the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? __eou__ really ? i thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__ they did . he inherited the money from an uncle . i hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__ dying can be very expensive nowadays ! what ’ s he going to do with it ? __eou__ he said that he would probably invest most of it . he ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . he just wants some extra money available for when he retires . __eou__ i had some good financial news yesterday too . __eou__ really ? have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__ no , but i got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work i ’ ve put in recently . i think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . __eou__ it certainly was ! so , what are you going to do with your windfall ?
hello ! what are you reading about in the newspaper ? __eou__ hello ! i was exhausted some studying , so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately , the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i ’ m shocked that the police haven ’ t caught the killer yet . __eou__ people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . __eou__ you mean “ if ” they catch the murderer . i ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . __eou__ there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . __eou__ well , there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? __eou__ yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . __eou__ well , they ’ ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . __eou__ i ’ m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that . __eou__ i ’ m sure they are . oh , and a local man won the lottery . i ’ m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i ’ m amazed that i haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . it ’ s so unfair ! __eou__ don ’ t be moody ! i hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ ve been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties .
hello ! let me introduce myself . my name is nancy . __eou__ nice to meet you , i'am seven . i don't think i ' ve seen you around before . __eou__ no , i just started working here at ibm , i am assigned sale department . __eou__ what do you do there ? __eou__ i main market reasearch , and you ? __eou__ i ' ve beaning worked ibm for years . i am vested personnel file system , he is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , i like working for him . __eou__ really ? i don't believe i would met him , is he here now ? __eou__ yes , that's him over there-the taller , handsome one . would you let me introduce you ? __eou__ thanks , that's would be lovely . you'r right , he is kind and nice looking .
how do you do . i ’ m mark rancor . __eou__ nice to meet you . __eou__ may i know your name , please ? __eou__ i ’ m rose teller . i think i ’ ve seen you somewhere before ? __eou__ ah , yes . i remember now . were you mr . john ’ s dinner partner last month ? __eou__ yes , i was . you work for 3m , right ? __eou__ i did but now i ’ m for microsoft . how are things with you ? __eou__ good . __eou__ may i know what you do ? __eou__ i ’ m a fashion designer . next month , i have a fashion show . i ’ d love it if come . i can get you a couple of tickets . so you can bring a friend if you like . __eou__ sure . that would be great . good luck . __eou__ thank you .
oh , god . it ’ s late . i ’ m afraid i have to leave . __eou__ but you just got here . can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? __eou__ that ’ s very kind of you . but if i don ’ t go now i ’ ll miss the last bus . __eou__ that ’ s too bad . __eou__ thank you for your hospitality . __eou__ thanks for coming . __eou__ how about next time we meet at my place ? and i ’ ll treat you to chinese food . i know how much you like it . we can order in and watch video too . anything you like , i promise . __eou__ great idea . i ’ m looking forward to it . see you then . __eou__ well . i really do have to go . __eou__ good night then . __eou__ see you tomorrow .
hi , martin . i ’ ve been looking for you all morning . __eou__ what ’ s up ? __eou__ i want to say goodbye . i ’ m leaving for america tomorrow . __eou__ america ? did you get admit to mit ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ congratulations ! susan . i ’ m so happy for you . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ really going to miss you . __eou__ me too . i ’ ll write to you once i get settled . but i have so much to do . you might have to wait a while . but i really will write to you . i love to write letters . i think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call . __eou__ ok . take care . have a nice journey . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ look after yourself . bye . __eou__ bye .
i want to say goodbye to everyone . __eou__ you ’ re leaving so soon . when are you off ? __eou__ i ’ m catching the 9 fifteen train tomorrow morning . __eou__ how about i come and see you off ? __eou__ you really don ’ t need to . __eou__ ok . i ’ ll miss you . i hope we can see each other again soon . __eou__ i hope so , too . thank you , lily . thank you for everything . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . __eou__ please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . __eou__ ok . take care . i hope you have a good journey . __eou__ thank you . remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in washington . __eou__ of course . i will . __eou__ goodbye , then . thanks again for everything .
what ’ s “ pi ” ? __eou__ that ’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , i think . __eou__ i see . what is that ratio exactly ? __eou__ it ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . what ’ s the diameter of your circle ? __eou__ it ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters . __eou__ ok . my next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . what ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ? __eou__ according to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound . __eou__ that means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars . __eou__ what ’ s the next question . __eou__ fractions . what ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? that ’ s three-eights . easy . the next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” . __eou__ i can help you there . those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together . __eou__ so , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 . __eou__ exactly . anything else ? __eou__ how many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether . __eou__ you ’ ll be a mathematician one day .
what ’ s the area of your country ? __eou__ it ’ s not very big . it ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . __eou__ that sounds quite big ! how many people live there ? __eou__ there are about 30 million people in my country . most of them live in the north . __eou__ what ’ s the average income ? __eou__ that ’ s the really hard to say . i think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ so your country is fairly rich . __eou__ i think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western europe . our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . it has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ unemployment in my country is a fraction of that .
i really should be on my way . __eou__ oh , don ’ t go yet . let ’ s at least have one more . __eou__ no , thank you . i can ’ t . __eou__ it ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . __eou__ thank you very much . i had a really good time . __eou__ thanks for coming ! we should meet again sometime soon . __eou__ that would be great ! actually , can i get your phone number , ella ? that ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if i call you sometime . __eou__ anytime . you can reach me 5558929 . __eou__ ok , got it . i ’ ll call you sometime next week . __eou__ fine . __eou__ it ’ s time to go and i hope we can get together again soon . __eou__ i hope so , too . bye ! ben .
hello , ann ! is that you ? __eou__ yes , it is . hi , tom ! it's a real surprise to see you here . __eou__ it's been a long time ! what's new ? __eou__ nothing much . what about you ? is everything going well ? __eou__ not bad i guess . i just got back from hawaii . __eou__ how was it ? __eou__ i had a good time . you seem to be in a hurry . don't let me hold you up . __eou__ sorry , i've got a meeting in half an hour . __eou__ ok , i won't keep you then . __eou__ great ! it's good to see you . goodbye ! __eou__ yes , stay in touch . bye ! __eou__ give me your email , would you ? __eou__ sure ! it's txyb@gmail.com .
is there a lot of crime in your city ? __eou__ there ’ s some , but i don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . there ’ s very little major crime . __eou__ it ’ s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . __eou__ that happens in many places . in my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but i don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate . __eou__ some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach . __eou__ i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . __eou__ that ’ s possible , but i ’ m not sure it would really happen like that .
which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? __eou__ i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets . __eou__ how would you solve the problem ? __eou__ i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . __eou__ it would probably be very expensive . __eou__ i think the government can afford it . besides , there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . __eou__ it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . __eou__ if we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . __eou__ most voters what everything bout ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . __eou__ the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . __eou__ yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly .
there are so many environment problems in the world today . do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ i hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but i doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . there ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . __eou__ everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . it ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . countries and companies just want the wood . they ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . we should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . __eou__ in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow enough food . __eou__ it also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? you could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ i think i ’ d like to do that . i could take the things i learn here back to my country when i have finished my studies .
i went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . __eou__ yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue . __eou__ so did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon . it was raining cats and dogs . __eou__ i know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm . it was pouring with rain all afternoon . __eou__ we really have some movable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . __eou__ if it was sunning all year round there would be drought . you probably would not like it either . __eou__ i guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . __eou__ the weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like . our weather is so changeable .
is the environment a big issues in your country ? it is in mine . __eou__ it is in mine too . the biggest issue is water . the climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__ what methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__ water is rationed . we can only use a certain amount each month . it means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . they use too much water . __eou__ i see . i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ i think you ’ re right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
what are the seasons like in your city ? __eou__ summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . i love the summers in my city , but i hate the wintertime . __eou__ does it ever rain in summer ? __eou__ we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . __eou__ what are spring and autumn like ? __eou__ i like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . in spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . it ’ s usually windy with some rain . autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . what are the seasons like in you city ? __eou__ well , i live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . we get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . in winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . summers are warm , but not hot . spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each . the weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city . __eou__ do you usually go on a summer holiday ? __eou__ no , i don ’ t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm . __eou__ i usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . i try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .
what's the weather like in your city ? __eou__ in the summer it gets very hot . the temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . when it is hot we often get rains . the winters are drier . __eou__ the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . the rain falls mostly in the winter . and we often get snow . __eou__ what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . __eou__ in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . the streets are often icing in the morning . with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . __eou__ yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? __eou__ we do have a few fog days in winter . but i would not say we have a lot of fogs . the sky are usually clearly in your city , are they ? __eou__ yes , they are like i said we have thunderstorms . but each one usually last a few hours . then the skys are clear again . __eou__ have you ever had snow in your city ? __eou__ my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . but my parents and i never see it outside of my city . __eou__ the river in my city sometime freeze over . people go ice-skating on it . in summer people go boating on the river . but few people go swimming because it is not very clean . __eou__ as you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean . but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning .
what book is that ? __eou__ i just bought a new atlas . i ’ m looking this map of the world . look at russia ! that ’ s a vast country . __eou__ canada , china , and the usa are huge too . __eou__ there are several tiny countries in the world too . countries like monaco are smaller than many cities . __eou__ those small countries are microscopic compared to russia . european countries are relatively small . france looks quite big in europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . __eou__ britain is half the size of france , but great britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . __eou__ the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest .
that looks like an interesting book . __eou__ it is . it ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . __eou__ there are the pymeids . it ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . __eou__ they don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . there ’ s picture of the pentagon in the united states . it ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . __eou__ look at that cylindrical office building . i ’ ve never been seen one that shape before . __eou__ yes . usually only towers are cylindrical in shape . __eou__ tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . they ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . __eou__ this is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . it ’ s a massive oval . __eou__ what sports do they play there ? __eou__ it says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . __eou__ is that building a perfect cube ? __eou__ according to the book , it is . i ’ ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . look at the building . from the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . what kind of building is it ? __eou__ is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in brussels . see ? it consists of several connected by cylinders . i believe you can go up and down inside it .
what do you do in summer ? __eou__ i love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . i love being out in the fresh summer air . how about you ? __eou__ i don ’ t often go for walks , but i either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__ what do you do in winter ? __eou__ well , i play sports indoors quite often . if i ’ m feeling lazy , i just watch a film at home . i prefer summer to winter . __eou__ i think most people do . i like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . it ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . __eou__ yes . i like wearing shorts in summer . my legs would freeze ! __eou__ do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__ thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever !
how do you usually spend your time , now that you ’ ve retired ? __eou__ well , i nearly always get up at dawn . i don ’ t like sleeping in late . the days are longer in summer than in winter , so i get up in summer . i usually do some exercise when i get up . __eou__ what do you have for breakfast ? __eou__ i usually have cereal , but sometimes i cook a traditional english breakfast . __eou__ that sounds nice . how do you spend your mornings ? __eou__ i usually do housework in mornings . i go shopping occasionally . i like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . i always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . it takes about 20 minutes to drive there . __eou__ how do you spend your afternoons ? __eou__ i usually meet some friends and we play sports together or i might spend some time alone on my hobbies . i spend winter evening watching tv , but i spend summer evening at cultural events if i have time .
do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? __eou__ it could be . there are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . __eou__ it seems that the climate in this country is changing . __eou__ the summers are hotter . the last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . there have also been stronger winds . __eou__ i think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . __eou__ i think you ’ re right . climate change naturally over time , but i think that human activities are speeding up the change . i wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . __eou__ me too . if we don ’ t do something soon , it might be too late .
are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? __eou__ there are a few stories about natural disasters . there is a massive forest fire in australia . it covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . __eou__ was it caused accidentally or naturally ? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa . __eou__ nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . the drought in africa is causing starvation . millions of people have migrated to try and find food . __eou__ what is the international community doing to help ? __eou__ the european union has sent several plants with relief supplies . several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . refugee camps have been set up across the region . __eou__ how many countries have been affected ? __eou__ six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . __eou__ i saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran . __eou__ yes . there have been a few there recently . they say that this one was not a big quake . the iranians are dealing with it on their own . they have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . __eou__ does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? __eou__ so far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital .
is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ? __eou__ there is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . the oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ yes , it is . my country is famous for having that natural resources . we also have a lot of natural gas . __eou__ we have some too . do you have a lot of coal ? __eou__ no coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . we don ’ t have many metal deposits . __eou__ there are a few in my country . we have deposit of gold , but they are very small . __eou__ when i traveled around your country , i bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . the jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . the gold was found in mountain steams . __eou__ that ’ s right . a few people go panning for gold in rivers . __eou__ you have many trees in your country . that ’ s another natural resources . __eou__ it ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . government policy is to conserve those forests . __eou__ i see . that ’ s probably a good idea . too many forest are being destroyed . __eou__ is your country ’ s environment being damaged by the oil industry ? __eou__ we have some inspections , but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil . there has been some damage , but it is under control .
does your country export a lot of natural resources ? __eou__ we export some coal to european countries , but our biggest exports is copper , which we export to europe , north america , and china . __eou__ which resources do you have to import ? __eou__ we import a little oil from venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . we import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries . __eou__ i heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone . __eou__ yes , that ’ s right . so far , only small deposits have been found . engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . the government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country . __eou__ if your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent . __eou__ yes . we need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones .
how long will it take us to drive to london ? __eou__ i think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . __eou__ that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours . __eou__ you ’ re right . we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up area . __eou__ so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? __eou__ ok . you haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ? __eou__ no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car . __eou__ i think it ’ s over five meters long . i can ’ t remember exactly . it has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . __eou__ wow ! that ’ s fast ! i don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . __eou__ we can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
which sports are popular in your country ? __eou__ most people like football . more boys like football than girls . a few girls play it really well . some people like playing basketball . __eou__ do many people like tennis ? __eou__ more and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__ in my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . a few people like extreme sports , but i think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__ extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . no one i know plays golf . __eou__ i know loads of people who play it regularly . there are plenty of golf courses around the country . in the past , only a tiny number of people played . __eou__ a great deal of people follow rugby in my country . __eou__ there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
how are the children doing at sport ? __eou__ i ’ m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__ he ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__ he ’ s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again , that ’ s fine for someone his age . __eou__ two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__ the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__ how are they at swimming ? __eou__ they ’ re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ i ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ i think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__ it seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .

everyone wants to be financial lose kill . you must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . i ’ m thinking about buying stocks . it can be a good investment if i can manage well . what do you say ? __eou__ i partly agree with you . buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . anyway , people like us need help with investing . why not do some online research ? there are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . in addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . __eou__ wow , you sound very professional . __eou__ i just watched the investment tv program last weekend . it has become a very hot topic these days . actually i am not even a beginner .
when it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ? __eou__ maybe it is right since everything is possible . you know the market changes quickly these days . but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__ but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__ if you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . __eou__ i will think about it .
shakespeare was born in 1867 . __eou__ no , it sounds wrong . he was born in the 16th century . __eou__ are you sure ? can you make it more exact ? __eou__ 1564 .
i am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? __eou__ fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__ how did that happen ? __eou__ a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face . __eou__ sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
i think we should accept his plan . __eou__ i'm afraid i can't agree with you . __eou__ why ? __eou__ simply because it's not practical at all .
i think this one will do . __eou__ i'm sorry . i don't think so . __eou__ why ? what's wrong with it ? __eou__ it's much too hard for his age .
which season do you like best ? __eou__ i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ? __eou__ i prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for ice-cream . __eou__ how do you get through the stuffy daytime ? __eou__ well , i have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time .
what's up ? you look depressed . __eou__ i just had a quarrel with him . __eou__ would you rather i taught him a lesson for you ? __eou__ no , thanks .
how do mark and jones compare , in your opinion ? __eou__ generally speaking , mark's personality is much more agreeable than jones __eou__ may i venture to ask if you've decided to employ mark ? __eou__ possibly .
do you have any plan for your future ? __eou__ i'd prefer to go abroad , if possible . __eou__ many people are striving for going abroad nowadays.it seems to be a trend . __eou__ i'm one of them .
so , monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? __eou__ actually , i had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . i woke up this morning and found it was sunny . so i called lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . we were going to look for a new purse . now it turned out to be like this . neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . __eou__ that ’ s too bad . i hate sand storms too . it can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with climate ? anyway , i think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__ it is not an easy job . the government is working on it . lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . but of course , it will not work overnight . so , have you come out with a new plan for today ? __eou__ my new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .
good lord ! look at that man . __eou__ yes ? __eou__ he's swimming in the cold sea . he must be very strong . __eou__ sure he is . winter swimming does good to health , i hear .
how have you been ? __eou__ fine , thank you . __eou__ and how's everyone in your family ? __eou__ very well , thank you . i'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.would you care to join us ? __eou__ i'd love to , but i'm afraid i can't .
where would you like to have your dinner ? __eou__ i don't care as long as it's a chinese restaurant . __eou__ you don't like western food ? __eou__ i really find chinese dishes more to my taste .
how about the hiking ? it was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? __eou__ can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . we had a lot of fun there . there was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . we arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__ you had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? __eou__ of course not ! we built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . we went sliding on the nice hill . it was a real work out . at noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . you must come with us next time . i bet you will love it . __eou__ well . you know i hate walking , but i can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video .
hi , monica , i got big news . __eou__ you got a raise ? __eou__ not really , just take a wild guess . __eou__ you got promoted ? __eou__ well , it is not going to happen so soon , i guess . __eou__ you won a lottery ? don ’ t beat around the bush , just tell me , please . __eou__ ok , i lost 5 pounds .

i feel confused by all the diet options out there . i don ’ t know which one actually works . __eou__ most of them are not so practical . it will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . i think making an exercise plan can be more effective . __eou__ maybe you ’ re right . it is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . i ’ d better join in a fitness club . __eou__ you don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . __eou__ i bought an exercise dress yesterday and i found it was hard to dress it up .
have you ever played making ? __eou__ not really , but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game . __eou__ yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . __eou__ typical francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ it is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active .
would you like to go skiing with me ? i heard the new ski area is great . they have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . i think it suits you best . __eou__ sounds not bad ! you know , the only thing i worried about is the safety . i ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . __eou__ well , then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . there ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . __eou__ i will think about it . __eou__ come on ! it is really a fun game .
japanese is easy to learn . __eou__ you're mistaken about it . as a matter of fact , it's very hard . __eou__ i don't think so.there ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like chinese . __eou__ you're quite right.but many japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes .
i am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices . __eou__ the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ actually , i ’ m interested in all of them . the more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ toss a coin to decide then .
which is more interesting to you , flying kites or going roller-skating ? __eou__ well , flying kites is more fun to me . __eou__ i've got no kite . do you have one ? __eou__ let's go and buy one .
have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? __eou__ yes , i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . __eou__ volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ? __eou__ i will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . i ’ m very excited about it now . __eou__ it must be a unique experience . i ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__ ok , i will bring you photos as many as possible .
i wonder if you agree that money is not happiness . __eou__ i don't entirely agree with you . __eou__ then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ? __eou__ well , that's a thing .
let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at mall cinema.betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and i shouldn't miss it . __eou__ oh , goodness , please not again.that ' s what we did last week . __eou__ no , we didn't . last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . __eou__ right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? besides , this is the last week for the third movie in destroyer series and i want to see that on a big screen . action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . __eou__ oh , yeah , and i did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.but you liked that movie , didn't you ? __eou__ oh , sure , it was great . i had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . __eou__ it wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.we went to an excellent restaurant . __eou__ that place doesn't have a single meat dish.just fish and shellfish and you know i don't like fish that much . __eou__ and i don't like meat that much.the only meat i eat is chicken . __eou__ but when i pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . i always respect your food preferences . __eou__ well , i suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . __eou__ now you're talking , we can see that love story next time .
who's your favorite film star ? __eou__ tom hanks is always my favorite film star . __eou__ what films feature him ? __eou__ many !

i'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys . __eou__ but you promised to play chess with me this afternoon . __eou__ yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team . __eou__ so what ? __eou__ you know how much i want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.if i don't go to practise today.they ' ll get someone else and i'll miss my chance . __eou__ i don't care about baseball.you know i need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if i washed the dishes for you last sunday , and i did . __eou__ i know , and i will . __eou__ when ? __eou__ after baseball practice . __eou__ and then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your show is on.you are going to break your promise . __eou__ no , i won't . i'm going to skip tv tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you . __eou__ well , i'd rather do it the way we set up.but if you promise to give me your best game , it's ok with me . __eou__ no problem , i'll play as hard as i can and give you an extra game to say thanks .

what's the name of the series just showed ? __eou__ doctor butcher . __eou__ what a horrible name ! is it full of suspense ? __eou__ no , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit .
do you like watching tv ? __eou__ yes i do , usually . __eou__ what do you exactly mean by usually ? __eou__ i don't like spending time on commercials.there ' re too many commercials on tv .
look at this headline - elvis baby born on spacecraft . where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? __eou__ i ’ ve often wondered the same thing . i also wonder who reads them . then i realize that i ’ m standing here reading them myself . __eou__ it looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . __eou__ i think we picked the right line . this one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . __eou__ maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . __eou__ i ’ m glad . we have only about twenty things here , and i ’ m in a hurry to get home .
what's your favorite tv program ? __eou__ i like variety shows . __eou__ i also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . __eou__ i prefer a variety show without a host .
i went to visit a customer in ivs company the other day . their offices were very impressive , especially their company logo which is all over the place . there are logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . they are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . it is really decorated identity . __eou__ it is just too much . don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? __eou__ not at all ! i like the design so much . the designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . __eou__ wow , i doubt that .
do you take a bus to and from work ? __eou__ yeah , everyday . and there ’ s only one choice.all the other buses are going the other direction . __eou__ hmm . i have the same problem . when i leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.so the buses are always crowded . __eou__ oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . i will tell you the funniest thing i have seen in china . it ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . __eou__ that sounds terrible the way you describe it . but you know , not long ago i really suffered on the bus . __eou__ what happened ? were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? __eou__ you just can ’ t imagine ! i waited for the first bus but it was too full , so i waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . then i decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . it was so full that i had to stand on one foot ! no kidding ! __eou__ hmm . good exercise , uh ? __eou__ yeah , absolutely ! __eou__ and it ’ s so much fun . one day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . i was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . __eou__ you were so happy , weren ’ t you ? __eou__ what do you think ? i ’ m a good boy .
you have been here for how long ? four months now ? __eou__ yeah , about . __eou__ do you know chinese better now ? __eou__ oh , definitely . i remember , when i first arrived in guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . __eou__ oh , yeah . many chinese like to bargain . it happens almost everywhere . __eou__ i mean , i understand that . but the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . my perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . the truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . __eou__ a shouting match ? you ’ re so funny . you must be exaggerating . i don ’ t believe it . __eou__ i am not exaggerating at all . i ’ m telling you the truth . that was how i felt at that time . __eou__ yes , perhaps . chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . __eou__ yes , absolutely true .
excuse me , sir , do you know what time it is ? __eou__ oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . the rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ yeah . i was in a hurry and i forgot my umbrella today . __eou__ i have one . we could share it . which way are you going ? __eou__ oh , that ’ s very kind of you . i am going to the garden hotel . __eou__ i am going there , too . we can walk together . __eou__ sure .
you are married to a foreigner , huh ? so what ’ s it like ? __eou__ well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . the things that are important to me are not important to him . we had a lot of conflicts . __eou__ yeah , i know what you mean . the first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . __eou__ and now we have a two-year-old boy . we ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . __eou__ oh , so he ’ s half chinese and half american . that ’ s unusual . what languages does he speak , then ? __eou__ right now he speaks mostly chinese , and he can say a few english words . but he will learn . __eou__ what does he look like ? can people tell ? __eou__ yes , people surely can . he ’ s whiter than the chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . my husband says his eyes are very chinese though .
i hear you're being sent to madrid for the annual conference . is that right ? __eou__ yes , it would be my first trip overseas . actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country . __eou__ are you serious ? you haven't even been anywhere on vacation ? __eou__ no , i have never vacationed anywhere exotic . but even if i don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least i can travel on company time ! __eou__ well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? __eou__ yes , it wasn't too hard to get . all i had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee . __eou__ you leave next tuesday , right ? what time is your flight ? __eou__ my flight departs at 7 am . i have everything except for my luggage ready . __eou__ if your flight is leaving so early , i can take you to the airport and see you off . i'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 . __eou__ that would be great ! thanks a lot !
would you recommend some places for sightseeing ? __eou__ how about great canyon ? __eou__ is it worth seeing ? __eou__ of course ! it's the most wonderful natural works .
did you see the way that brian came to work yesterday ? ever since he came back from that conference in silicon valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . it's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . i don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ he was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . i guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in california . it comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ it's not as bad as that ... we are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . besides , didn't you hear what brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . that's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable .
even if our company didn't have a dress code , i still think people would wear formal clothing to work . __eou__ i wouldn't be so sure ... people want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . __eou__ maybe that's true for some positions , but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . they dress for success ! you can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . it's just not respectful to you client . __eou__ i think what you wear is so overrated . i would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . __eou__ it's not as simple as that . people judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . so dressing professional is being professional . the image that you portray to others is so important in business . it's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . __eou__ maybe you're right , but i'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
i'm really fed up with larry ! he's the biggest airhead i've ever met.he always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . __eou__ you shouldn't be so negative.you ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.but if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody . __eou__ you only say that because you don't have to work with him.the people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.take mary for example.she ' s smart and enthusiastic . i've never met anyone as cheery as she is . __eou__ everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.even larry.he might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.she always leaves at 5pm sharp . __eou__ isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker ? what about bob ? everybody loves bob.even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co-worker . __eou__ you're right.he ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.the only thing he's lacking in is experience . __eou__ maybe that's why he's so nice !
do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? __eou__ from my own experience as a career woman , i would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . __eou__ do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? or are there more issues coming into play ? __eou__ i think it's a very complicated issue . a part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . __eou__ what about affirmative action ? hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? __eou__ affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world .
hi there , i'm steve saunders.what ' s your name ? __eou__ i'm patti whitney.isn ' t this convention great ? __eou__ yes it is , better than i expected it would be.the presenters have been first rate.is this the first conference you've been to ? __eou__ no , i've been coming for the last 3 years.each year keeps getting better.where are you from ? __eou__ i'm from long island , new york.what about yourself ? __eou__ i'm from the other side of the coast--los angeles . __eou__ wow . i really like california ... the weather there is much better than the east coast . __eou__ have you been to california ? __eou__ just once.quite a few years ago we took the kids to disneyland on our vacation.they had a blast . __eou__ how many kids do you have ? __eou__ two , a boy and a girl.they ’ re already grown now . __eou__ well , california ’ s changed over the last little while.you should come back out sometime .
can i get you something to drink ? __eou__ no , that's okay , i already have a coke.why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day . __eou__ i guess i could take a break.so , how do you like denver ? __eou__ it's great ! the mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.have you been here for a long time ? __eou__ about six years ... __eou__ what do you do for a living ? __eou__ i manage one of the ski lodges.it ' s a great job , i can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and i also get to ski for free all season . __eou__ wow , talk about job perks ! that's great . i would like to do something exciting like that.but i am only an accountant.not too much excitement there.huh ? __eou__ that's okay.if it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing !
did your company go union ? i heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so it's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . mostly people are pretty happy about it ... i guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , i'd guess . i don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . the only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog .
did you hear what's going on downtown today ? all the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . __eou__ wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . what gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? __eou__ i think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . i mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . __eou__ so what kind of demands do they have ? what are they asking for specifically ? __eou__ they want raises and medical insurance , and i think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . that's probably the most important issue .
for our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? __eou__ usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . but to be on the safe side , i'll order a table for half-past twelve . will that suit your schedule ? __eou__ i've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . can you make the reservation a little earlier ? if we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . __eou__ are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? __eou__ yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . __eou__ that'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? __eou__ as along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . __eou__ with your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . __eou__ we can make some special arrangement if we need to . after all , it's the company who is footing the bill .
do you have the day off today ? how come you're not at work now ? __eou__ i don't have the day off . our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . __eou__ are you serious ? why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? i'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... __eou__ it happens quite often , actually.whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ...
the company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . did you put your name in for it ? __eou__ no , i don't really care too much for seminars ... i find them to be either boring ot useless . i mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? __eou__ it's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . you can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . the social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . __eou__ i'm still not too jazzed about going ... i feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . __eou__ well , what if i told you the seminar is going to be held in hawaii ? does that perk your interest ? __eou__ now you're talking .
what did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? do you think it was worth the investment to go ? __eou__ yeah , i really got a lot of the session . the workshop topic was resolving personal problems . it was led by a professional human resources director . the teacher had a lot of experience , and i think we were all given a really good base to start with . __eou__ the workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? __eou__ it depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . we learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . __eou__ sounds like you really learned a lot . __eou__ i did ... i just hope i can implement all these great ideas that we shared .
what did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? do you think it did much good ? __eou__ well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . i don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time . __eou__ i think that's an important part of it all ... we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss ... we can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . i really think it helped our team jell together better . __eou__ yeah , i guess you're right . i think the trust game was my favorite . i think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more . __eou__ the trust game was your favorite , huh ? my favorite part was the personality tests . i think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team.also , when you know the personality strengths of your colleagues , it helps you understand them better .
management is going through a big turnover these days . with bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . they've been dropping like flies ... __eou__ isn't that a good thing ? having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? __eou__ actually , i don't think so . supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . they are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . if there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . you know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . __eou__ you're right , we do need leadership . but what we don't need is too many people to lead us . you know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough indians ... __eou__ alright ... i get your point .
at their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with blycore . all the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... i don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... __eou__ if they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . you'd think it might be our ceo or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . __eou__ is it really that simple ? it doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... __eou__ it might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . the stockholders are our investors . they own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . __eou__ i guess i'd buy that ...
where's bill ? the ambassador is already here . the meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ he's late again . traffic is probably holding him up . you know , he commutes from the suburbs . it's not easy commuting every day . we should cut him some slack . __eou__ even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , i don't think it's heavy traffic that makes bill late . he takes the train , remember ? __eou__ oh , that's right . well , the train shouldn't be late . that means there is only one explanation ... bill must have overslept . __eou__ well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . he must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ that's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . in all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ it's too difficult to park your car in the city . also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare .
so who does he think he is , anyway , i can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , i mean , it's now like he is the ceo , or anything . __eou__ um ... actually i am guessing you didn't get the memo . your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the ceo slot . he actually is the ceo now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . __eou__ yikes ! you are joking , right ? i can't believe it . no wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . i thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . what big shoes to fill ! __eou__ no kidding ! when the last ceo left , we were worried about the future of the company . __eou__ what does a ceo do anyway ? i know the ceo makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? __eou__ he is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . he or she must give leadership to all company officers , as ceo is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . __eou__ must be one smart guy .
how were things in the tokyo branch when you were there ? __eou__ good ! they have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . it's nice to see some improvement for a change . __eou__ do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? __eou__ yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to japan . the only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here . __eou__ why would you say that ? __eou__ they aren't too familiar with doing business outside of japan . there are a lot of cultural differences to account for . __eou__ i'll say ! sometimes they just do things really differently . but one thing i can say , they are really hospitable . __eou__ have you ever been to japan ? __eou__ sure ! i just got back yesterday . i'm still suffering from jet lag .
how can i tell her about this ? __eou__ don't worry , you'll find a way . __eou__ there is no need to be so frustrated . __eou__ how can you live without job in the future ? __eou__ don't worry , you'll find a way .
why are you in such a hurry ? __eou__ i should finish it as soon as possible . __eou__ don't worry , do it step by step __eou__ why can i learn it ? __eou__ don't worry , do it step by step . __eou__ i feel i really stupid .
is that girl your girlfriend ? __eou__ no , it's not . __eou__ she doesn't look like our classmate . __eou__ don't mistake her as somebody . she ' s my older sister . __eou__ really , she's so pretty .
come on , tara . let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . the movie is starting in a few minutes . __eou__ we can ’ t break into the line . don ’ t be so impatient . we ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . __eou__ two tickets , please . how much are they ? __eou__ oh no , ari . i didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when i invited you to go tonight . let ’ s go dutch . i ’ ll pay my own way . i insist . __eou__ i ’ m looking forward to this film . i read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . __eou__ me , too . it will be great to see something light and funny for a change . i ’ m tired of heavy drama . __eou__ are these seats okay ? __eou__ they ’ re fine , but i can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn .
how are you getting along with your wife now ? __eou__ what can you expect ? not that good . __eou__ what are you going to do then ? __eou__ just let it go . __eou__ how are your work now ? __eou__ not bad , just let it go .
did you tip the bellboy ? __eou__ yes , but i don ’ t think it was enough . he looked disappointed . i gave him three dollars . __eou__ that sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . if they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more . __eou__ it ’ s the same in balloon . but i definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . the fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . that ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! too much ! __eou__ i disagree . he was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . one should reward good service . __eou__ i ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.let ’ s see.the bill is one hundred dollars . that seems reasonable . how much tip should i leave ? __eou__ remember last month when we were in europe ? maybe californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra .
well , i can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . __eou__ john , they are old-fashioned people from the chinese countryside . that ’ s their custom . __eou__ i know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . __eou__ don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? __eou__ yes , but americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . __eou__ i think that maybe chinese families are closer than your families . __eou__ i think you ’ re right !
frank , i want your advice on something . some scientists i met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . actually , they called it an informal get-together . __eou__ and what ’ s the problem ? __eou__ when i asked how people were going to dress , dr . lite said it was casual . __eou__ and you want to know what to wear ? __eou__ well , last night i went out with some journalists for a casual party , but i was overdressed . i wore what i consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . __eou__ that sounds just right to me . what was wrong with it ? __eou__ everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . several of the women had on running shoes . i felt out of place . so i have no idea what to wear tonight . __eou__ my guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party .
sally , i ’ m tired of this western food . i really miss my mother ’ s sichuan cooking . __eou__ i ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . but can ’ t you try to get used to western food ? __eou__ i have tried . but americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . __eou__ i suppose you ’ re right , lee . maybe that ’ s why so many westerners are overweight . __eou__ it ’ s interesting that americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . __eou__ you see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening .
thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . i was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . is that common ? __eou__ well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . __eou__ your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . __eou__ it wasn't . it was birdseed . we don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . __eou__ oh , i didn't think of that . well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in china . plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . __eou__ wait until you see what happens next ! the bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . let's go over and watch . __eou__ she ’ s got quite a crowd around her . oh , look ! that little girl caught it ! __eou__ she ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . i guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time .
hi , cindy . i thought i ’ d missed you . __eou__ oh , i am very sorry , hans . thank you for waiting for me . you must have been here a long time already . __eou__ it ’ s all right . __eou__ i was caught in the heavy rain , or i would have come earlier . i am sorry i kept you waiting . __eou__ i was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . i am happy to see you . did the rain hold you up long ? __eou__ yes . when i came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . and i forgot my umbrella . so i had to wait for the rain to let up . __eou__ i totally understand .
come in , come in ! __eou__ hi , gary , what happened ? i was waiting for you at the theater . why didn ’ t you meet me there ? __eou__ i thought we were supposed to meet here . __eou__ don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . __eou__ i ’ m sorry . we must have misunderstood each other . __eou__ why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? __eou__ you ’ re right . i am sorry . let ’ s go and watch the movie . __eou__ it ’ s okay . i don ’ t want to go now . we ’ ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . i don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
darling , i have news for you . bobby and his wife , evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . __eou__ really ? i thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . __eou__ actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . __eou__ oh , what a coincidence ! i bet bobby must be very happy about it . he likes children and always wants a child of his own . __eou__ in fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is american and the other one is chinese . __eou__ oh , right . now i know why they would want to see our boy . it ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! are they expecting a boy or a girl ? __eou__ it ’ s still a mystery . because evelyn is only three-month pregnant . but she begins to take her maternity leave now . __eou__ oh ! you mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? it ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ?
so chris , i've heard that you're from a big family . how many people ? __eou__ nine total . seven children and my parents . __eou__ seven children ? that's a lot . why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . my father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ jeez , seven children . that must have a lot of problems . we have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ it can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ like what ? i assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ that's one . another is the lack of personal property . everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . especially clothes . three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ and the age gap is also annoying . there's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . we have nothing in common . __eou__ same problem here . there's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . the last child was born just as the oldest was going to college .
thanks for offering to give me a lift . i ’ m looking forward to this party , but i didn ’ t want to go alone . __eou__ don ’ t mention it . it ’ s my pleasure . have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to new haven ? __eou__ no , this is my first.last week i went to a cookout for new professors at dean barksdale ’ s home . i took a taxi because i didn ’ t want to be late.but i was the first one __eou__ cookouts often start slowly . a two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . __eou__ thanks for telling me this . __eou__ i was late getting back from the mall , but i ’ m hurrying . __eou__ why are you in such a hurry ? they said , dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . i don ’ t want to be the first one there again . __eou__ don ’ t worry . we won ’ t be the first .
merry christmas ! __eou__ huh ? __eou__ i said merry christmas ! don ’ t you know that christmas is almost here ? __eou__ it is ? oh , that ’ s nice . __eou__ huh ? didn ’ t you know ? aren ’ t you excited ? __eou__ actually , i ’ d forgotten about it . __eou__ forgotten about it ? how could you ? __eou__ because i ’ m not christian , i ’ m jewish . __eou__ oh , i ’ m sorry . i didn ’ t know . __eou__ it ’ s all right . there are so many christians in america that everybody takes it for granted that i ’ m christian . __eou__ i guess so . so what do you do around this time of year ? __eou__ well , i ’ ll celebrate hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as christmas is to you . mainly i ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . __eou__ well , would you be horribly offended if i invited you to a christmas party at my house ? __eou__ not at all . a party is a party . i ’ ll be happy to come .
thank you for showing me your offices , mr . becker . i can see why washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . __eou__ why do you say that ? __eou__ the city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . __eou__ many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . government service can be a rewarding and secure career . __eou__ do you mean financially rewarding ? __eou__ well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . __eou__ i ’ ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . __eou__ sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . it ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . __eou__ how much do you make ? __eou__ i ’ m a gs - 15 . that ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a gs - 1 is paid a living wage .
hi , anna . i haven ’ t seen you for ages . where have you been ? __eou__ i ’ ve been away on holidays for sometime . __eou__ no wonder i haven ’ t seen you recently . where did you spend your holidays ? __eou__ i went with my husband . our first stop was bangkok . we stayed there for 5 days . then we flew to hong kong , stopover for 3 days . our last stop was china . we visited the great wall . __eou__ you must have a wonderful time . __eou__ yes . we enjoyed ourselves very much . have you traveled much , luke ? __eou__ no , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . we haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . the first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . we spent our honeymoon in the alps .
hi , my name is ted , what ’ s yours ? __eou__ what ? __eou__ i said , i ’ m ted , who are you ? __eou__ huh ? oh , my name is laura . __eou__ do you somewhere often , laura ? __eou__ huh ? i can ’ t hear you , the music ’ s too loud . __eou__ let ’ s go outside and talk . so laura , do you come here often ? __eou__ hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? __eou__ i asked if you come here often . __eou__ sometimes , usually once every few weeks . do you ? __eou__ no , this is my first time here . __eou__ i usually come with a group of friends . we dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . __eou__ yeah , that ’ s why i ’ m here . my friends dragged me here , because they think i spend too much time studying . __eou__ that ’ s good . it ’ s good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . __eou__ i guess so . but the music is too loud . i don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people , but next time i ’ ll do it in a park .
anita , i ’ ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already . __eou__ just for a few weeks . i need this vacation . you ’ ll be all right . you know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . don ’ t worry . i ’ ll be back as soon as i spend or gamble all my money . __eou__ gambling ? where ? __eou__ las vegas . i find gambling relaxing . i don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . besides , i love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . the casinos never close , you know . __eou__ if you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days .
do you have much experience with kids ? __eou__ yes . i have three sons . actually i also have a grandson . __eou__ to tell you the truth , sometimes i regret having a baby so early . i have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . __eou__ i understand . i was in your position before . at that time i couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . my husband seldom stayed at home . __eou__ what about your mother ? did she help you ? __eou__ yes , she did a little . but you see , americans are different from chinese . you can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . she could baby-sit only once or twice a week . that ’ s it . i had to care for them most of the time . __eou__ i see . so if my little family goes to america , i would end up taking care of my child all the time . my husband would have to make the bread for us . i just don ’ t know how i would get some education and be able to get a job some day . __eou__ don ’ t worry . you can take night classes . i did that when i had kids . and soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . then you could find a job and work . __eou__ sounds not so easy to me . when that happens , i will be too old to learn . __eou__ no . you see , i went back to school to get my master ’ s degree when i was in my thirties . you won ’ t be older than that .
so , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? __eou__ oh , i ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in thailand . __eou__ you have a girlfriend in thailand ? interesting . how come i have never heard of that ? __eou__ actually it will be my first time to meet her . __eou__ you mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? then , how could she be your girlfriend ? maybe you don ’ t even know her . __eou__ that ’ s true . but we have known each other over the internet for a few months now . actually we are on an intimate level . we even plan to be engaged next month . __eou__ congratulations ! it ’ s good to follow your heart . but i just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . __eou__ the internet is making interaction much faster . people are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . __eou__ probably you ’ re right .
lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! __eou__ george , how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . __eou__ well , lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me , it won ’ t cost much . __eou__ where will we sleep , then ? __eou__ in the van . __eou__ what about other expenses ? __eou__ let ’ s see . gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . come on . don ’ t hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? __eou__ maybe you ’ re right . when do you plan to go ? __eou__ the sooner the better ! i can ’ t wait ! __eou__ oh , i don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . __eou__ as long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food , so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time . __eou__ let ’ s go to chicago.we can have lunch in chinatown.then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field ! __eou__ you have such good ideas !
how is your job search going , janet ? __eou__ i found the ideal position . i ’ m working for a plumbing company . __eou__ are you serious ? you studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! __eou__ plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . i love this job . __eou__ i can see that . but i didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . __eou__ i didn ’ t , but i applied for an apprenticeship , and since i studied math , and i have a good attitude , my application was accepted . __eou__ congratulations ! you do have the right attitude .
i can ’ t wait to retire . __eou__ and then what ? __eou__ and then i ’ m moving to florida where i can play golf all day , every day ! __eou__ that sounds boring to me . __eou__ what do you plan on doing after you retire ? __eou__ yes , i think i will do something new . i ’ ve always wanted to be a teacher . i ’ m willing to begin studying to teach . __eou__ i admire your energy , ruth . you are young at heart .
how good are you at sports , bill ? __eou__ are you kidding ? i ’ m terrible ! but i love to watch sports . i go to football or baseball games a lot . and i read sports magazines every week . __eou__ wow ! __eou__ do you like sports , janice ? __eou__ oh , yes . i like to exercise . but i don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . i don ’ t have much time to do those things . __eou__ oh , i see . you know , we spend time doing different sports . how much time do you spend exercising ? __eou__ well , i guess i exercise about two hours a day . i do aerobics three times a week , and the other days i play badminton 1 with my husband . i always feel good afterward . __eou__ that ’ s great ! i ’ ve heard people say that before . __eou__ well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? it ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . __eou__ oh , i ’ m too lazy to play sports , and i ’ m not good at anything either . it hardly excites me .
so do you believe in palmistry ? __eou__ palmistry ? what is that ? __eou__ it's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . __eou__ oh , you mean palm reading 5 . i've seen that before , but i don't believe in it . __eou__ are you sure ? i've read a lot about palmistry and i've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . do you want me to take a look at your hand ? __eou__ really ? you've read books about it ? ok , then . but only if you want to . __eou__ ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... __eou__ what else do you see ? will i be successful ? will i make a lot of money ? __eou__ hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... __eou__ what ? what is it ? what's the matter ? __eou__ you seem to have a large gullibility line . you believe everything that you're told . __eou__ hey !
so , jack , do you believe in ghosts ? __eou__ no , not really . why do you ask ? __eou__ because i want to tell you about the time that i saw a ghost . __eou__ you saw a ghost ? when ? __eou__ it was many years ago , when i was a little child . it was the middle of the night , and i went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . i walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... __eou__ so that's where you saw the ghost ? in your house ? what did it look like ? was it hideous ? __eou__ it was a big , green thing that looked like a person . it was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... __eou__ so what did you do ? __eou__ i hid so that it couldn't see me . slowly it got closer and closer , until ... __eou__ until what ? what happened ? did you see it clearly ? did it attack you ? __eou__ it moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and i could hear its approaching footsteps . when it finally got to the top of the stairs , i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . he had gone to get a late night snack .
what's the matter , lisa ? you don't look too good . __eou__ i just found out that my husband is cheating on me . __eou__ you mean mark ? he seems like such an honest guy . __eou__ that's what i thought . it seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . __eou__ two months ? how did you find out ? __eou__ i asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . i picked it up and a girl asked to talk to mark . she then asked if i was his sister , and i said no , i was his wife . she hung up immediately . __eou__ so you asked him about the girl who called ? __eou__ yeah , he first said it was someone from work . he gave me a lame excuse , and so i pressed him on it . __eou__ what'd he do ? __eou__ he kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . __eou__ indiscretion ? how can an indiscretion last two months ? i mean , you two have been married for two years ! how can he do that to you ? __eou__ i told him i would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her . __eou__ good . i totally agree with what you did .
i don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . it seems like you ’ ve got good news everyday . __eou__ really ? do i look happy all the time ? __eou__ all i know is you look quite differently from other teachers . __eou__ oh , do you know why ? actually , it ’ s easy . because i always exercise . my exercise , i think , is very hard . i often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . i feel alive ! __eou__ oh , i know . i saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you . __eou__ yeah , they are doing it for fun . seldom would people like my exercise . it ’ s difficult and boring . __eou__ it ’ s true . many students do the exercise when they have to . we have p . e . once a week . __eou__ but i think chinese students need to exercise more . besides exercise will help them learn new things better . don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? __eou__ of course . i didn ’ t know that . i only know exercise makes bodies stronger . i should take some exercise then . do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ well , do what you like to do . it can be anything . jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . absolutely anything . doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . but remember to do some stretches first . __eou__ oh , i know . thank you .
hey , what's new ? __eou__ not much . just sitting here eating some chinese food . is that the paper ? why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? __eou__ ok , wait a minute ... let's see . i'm a taurus , and it says , mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse venus . i don't know what that means , but then it says , your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . remember to be positive . sounds good to me . __eou__ what about gemini ? what's the prediction ? __eou__ since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter , your fortunes are falling . bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . be careful . __eou__ that sounds bad ! i'm really worried , what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day . __eou__ but we have a date tonight ! you can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? __eou__ well , we have the thompsons , the greens , and the anderson , about twelve people total . __eou__ don't forget my friend andy from the office . he has nothing to do on friday , so i invited him over . __eou__ but that makes thirteen people ! we can't have thirteen people for dinner on friday ! __eou__ why can't we ? __eou__ it's an old superstition . if we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . can andy bring a date ? __eou__ i'm not sure . he just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and i don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . __eou__ but we can't have thirteen for dinner ! __eou__ i think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . it's only a superstition . it really doesn't mean anything . __eou__ absolutely not ! i refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on friday ! __eou__ ok , ok . i'll ask my sister to come . that way we'll have fourteen for dinner . __eou__ that's better .
i ’ m not a christian . i just want to know why americans believe that sort of thing . __eou__ believe what ? __eou__ you know ... like , say god is the creator of the universe , the bible , and jesus christ ... __eou__ you don ’ t believe that ? everyone interprets the bible in a different way . to some people , the gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . __eou__ what do you believe , john ? are you christian ? __eou__ to tell you the truth , i don ’ t know if i ’ m a christian or not . christians don ’ t often share the same belief . but i believe that we all possess , by the grace of god , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . __eou__ do you believe that one religion is better than another ? __eou__ no , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . __eou__ do you go to church regularly ? __eou__ when i ’ m home in the states , i go , but not in china .
how is the college search going ? __eou__ it's a huge headache . i have no idea what i want to do . __eou__ but don't you want to study music ? shouldn't it be easy ? __eou__ it should be , but there are too many options . my grades are good enough that i have a lot of choices , but after that ... __eou__ i know . you have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... __eou__ yup , you understand . and my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a catholic college . they both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . and the tuition 3 is usually pretty low . __eou__ i see . well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . he usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.he gave me some information , and next week i'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . __eou__ thanks for the information . and good luck in your college search .
alice , your father is amazing . he ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . __eou__ i know . he doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . my dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! __eou__ that sounds like my grandmother . she was always stubbornly independent . __eou__ it seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . __eou__ they see their independence as a kind of character strength . __eou__ sometimes they are too independent .
i saw an interesting program on tv last night . it was about elderly people . __eou__ and what did the program say ? __eou__ it said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . __eou__ i think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea . __eou__ and the tv program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . __eou__ and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . my father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day .
so , fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? __eou__ well , i ’ ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . __eou__ that ’ s cool . have you already found an apartment to live in ? __eou__ i ’ m planning on living with my parents . won ’ t you ? __eou__ i couldn ’ t even if i wanted to . my parents told me that if i went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . __eou__ you mean they ’ re kicking you out ? __eou__ not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . my older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . __eou__ well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . they said that it ’ s ok if i move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . __eou__ my parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . they think that it ’ s important that i should learn how to live on my own . __eou__ i know i need to learn that myself , but i just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place .
hey , sandy , what's new ? interested in a movie tonight ? __eou__ i wish i could , but i'm busy . i'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . __eou__ soup kitchen ? is that a new restaurant or something ? __eou__ nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . __eou__ how did you get involved in something like that ? __eou__ well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . i thought i'd try it once , and if i didn't like it i'd stop . __eou__ so what do you do there ? __eou__ it's simple . all we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . __eou__ yeah , it sounds easy . how long does it take ? __eou__ only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . why don't you give it a try ? __eou__ i don't know . i mean , i like helping the community and all that , but i don't know if i have the time ... __eou__ come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . why don't you come with me tonight ?
so it is hard to be a black student on campus ? __eou__ yes , in many ways it is . there are many stereotypes i have to deal with in my daily life . __eou__ stereotypes ? like what ? __eou__ well , like since i'm black , i must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . __eou__ i do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . i ’ ve seen you play basketball . __eou__ hey ! but that's not the only problem . there's also the affirmative action stigma . __eou__ you mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? that's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . __eou__ i know that , but some people don't think like that . and i get problems from teachers as well . __eou__ teachers ? i didn't think that they would be racist at all . __eou__ racist ? not exactly . it's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if i can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . suddenly i become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . __eou__ i see . it looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the us .
hi ! tom . fancy seeing you here it's a nice party isn't it ? __eou__ yeah . well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.how is everything going ? __eou__ quite well . i got my ma degree two weeks ago . __eou__ congratulations !
come in and have some coffee , anna . the kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . __eou__ i saw a lot of teenagers when alan and i were there yesterday . __eou__ they spend hours there , especially on weekends . __eou__ speaking of that trip , alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? __eou__ i know several . but wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? __eou__ isn ’ t that complicated ? __eou__ no , it ’ s easy . we ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . they ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . __eou__ we ? do you want to go with me ? __eou__ sure . i love going to the mall . __eou__ what do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ?
do you hear what happened to sally ? __eou__ no , what ? __eou__ she had to go to the hospital . __eou__ why ? __eou__ she passed out in class . seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . __eou__ why on earth would she do that ? you mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? that's crazy ! __eou__ yeah , but that's what she did . __eou__ i can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . and all for a certain look . __eou__ well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . it's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , it's in to be thin . it's hard for them not to listen . __eou__ true , but there are limits . being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . no one forces them to do this .
hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage ! __eou__ huh ? me ? __eou__ yeah , you . i just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . can't you read the no littering sign ? it's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . __eou__ why should i do that ? it's only a piece of garbage . why should you care ? __eou__ because this is a public place , and i want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage . __eou__ listen , i really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . it's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . it's not like there's garbage everywhere . besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another . __eou__ it's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . it's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . if everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! the cleaners can't be everywhere ! __eou__ ok , whatever . see , i'm putting it in the garbage can . __eou__ hold on , that's an item . you should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan .
hi , mr . zhang . what ’ s wrong ? you don ’ t look so happy . how was your date ? __eou__ i was turned down again . it ’ s frustrating . i guess you ’ ve got to teach me some skills . __eou__ me ? i ’ m even less experienced than you are . __eou__ at least you know what american women generally like in a man . __eou__ believe it or not , i guess american women like a man in good shape , which chinese women may not care about so much . that ’ s my honest opinion . i know you have been trying very hard . __eou__ american men are naturally taller than chinese men . so even if i exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . __eou__ no , that ’ s not true . i ’ ve met two american women who were married to chinese . but those chinese look very strong and healthy . so if you exercise more often , i bet it will surely be easier for you to date american girls . how old is jacky chan ? he ’ s small and short . but i bet he can have any american woman he wants . __eou__ you know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . because i never exercise . __eou__ why don ’ t you try then ? even if it doesn ’ t help you find an american girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . you won ’ t lose anything by doing that .
hi , my name ’ s karl . my wife and i are moving in next door . __eou__ hello , karl . i ’ m chuck jones . we ’ re going to be neighbors . __eou__ i ’ m happy to meet you . it seems everyone in town is so friendly . __eou__ this is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . we know everyone who lives around here . __eou__ well , i ’ m from chicago . there few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . __eou__ so , tell me , karl , hyoid you come all the way to minnesota to live ? __eou__ we wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in chicago !
what do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ in summer i go hiking , and in winter i ski . __eou__ do you mind if i come along sometime ? __eou__ no , not at all . glad to have you .
hey , frank . i heard you got a new job . __eou__ yeah , judy . i will be working for the post office . it ’ s not a bad job . __eou__ is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? __eou__ that ’ s right . i report to work at 5am everyday , and i only get 45 minutes for lunch . __eou__ so , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? __eou__ well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . __eou__ oh , i see . and can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? __eou__ yeah , that ’ s the best part . all of my children can get free medical care . __eou__ that ’ s a great employment benefit ! __eou__ now you know why i wanted to work for the post office !
susan , i am inviting you and frank to our house warming party this weekend . __eou__ a house warming party ? __eou__ yes , deborah and i are going to buy a new home in woodlawn . __eou__ congratulations ! that ’ s wonderful . i bet both of you are quite happy . __eou__ well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive . __eou__ i understand . that ’ s why christopher and i want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . __eou__ i agree . that ’ s why christopher is already looking for a job in maine , or wisconsin .
can you believe the headlines ? __eou__ what are you reading ? __eou__ i ’ m reading about michael milliken , the bond king . __eou__ didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? he got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ he got arrested all right . __eou__ if i remember , he got off with a light sentence . something like three years in a minimum-security prison . __eou__ yup , that ’ s him . he made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . __eou__ i think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . he ’ s still a millionaire . __eou__ that ’ s the kind of thing in america that gets me mad . some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . __eou__ i know . and some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years .
hi , kate . __eou__ hi , don . what a surprise ! __eou__ yeah , i saw someone walking like you , but i wasn ’ t sure . we haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? almost three months ? but you look quite different now . __eou__ have you noticed what has changed ? __eou__ oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . what have you been taking ? are you on a diet ? __eou__ yes . i ’ m on a diet , but i ’ ve not taken anything . i just eat less and exercise more . and it really worked in the past three months . i ’ ve lost twelve pounds . __eou__ wow ! that ’ s great . i sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . also you know , old habits are hard to break . __eou__ what kind of exercise do you think i do ? i just go to dance everyday after work . i ’ m taking an amateur dance class . i dance two hours everyday . __eou__ dance ? you only go dancing ? that ’ s not hard . i can do that . __eou__ sure . join my class next week .
i can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in new york city . __eou__ oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? __eou__ of course i had heard about that , but now i know how expensive it is to rent a place here . __eou__ i don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in new york . __eou__ why ? you pay so much for such a tiny space to live . __eou__ yeah , but so what ! i ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . and , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too .

do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__ of course ! it is the no . 1 stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it . __eou__ totally agree . what is your solution ? __eou__ well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy . __eou__ you seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__ it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__ but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__ i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ yes , at first i felt very awkward . after bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! i mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . and then i was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ did they mutiny ? __eou__ thankful , no . i guess everyone understands the opportunity i had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . i'm really moving up the ladder now that i'm considered a supervisor . after a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ it is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ...
mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . it seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . that is great news . what does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor .

i am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices . __eou__ the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ actually , i ’ m interested in all of them . the more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ toss a coin to decide then .
ella , it's been such a long week . i'm ready to go out and party . hey , let's go out for a night on the town . __eou__ gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . let's go out and get crazy tonight . __eou__ let's go to the new club on west street . __eou__ sure , but what do i wear ? __eou__ you can wear that pretty red dress .
should we ask jason to play ? he's always watching movies on hbo . __eou__ i guess we should invite him . i just hope he doesn't start talking about sylvester stallone and arnold schwarzenegger again . __eou__ oh , come on ! the game is better with three people . anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . __eou__ yeah , you're right . we'll never hear the end of it .
hi , francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ it was a nightmare . __eou__ what ’ s up ? __eou__ actually , the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then i lost my carry on bag when i was tackling with the officers in charge . i left the airport three hours later than i expected and then i was caught in a traffic jam . when i finally got home , i was totally exhausted . but i found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ this is really a sad story . did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ i am still waiting for their call . __eou__ take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
the new computer software is driving me crazy ! i really need a break ! __eou__ i know what you mean , carol . i ’ ve had nothing but trouble with it . they say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! __eou__ that ’ s what i ’ ve heard . but as far as i ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . can you pass the sugar , please ? __eou__ sure . why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? you haven ’ t taken a rest all morning .
did you see the information on sales for last year ? the sales review was made at our last board meeting . there's a great news for our shareholders . __eou__ yeah , i went over the figures this morning . we're finally started making money again ! __eou__ we've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . we have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . our strategy is working ! __eou__ not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . after a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . __eou__ the company's performance has improved since wallace became president . he's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . products are selling like hotcakes . __eou__ i think our success is partly because of wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . __eou__ let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . i hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . __eou__ let's hope it is !
spring festival is the most important festival in china , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , that's true . __eou__ how long is the holiday ? __eou__ it depends.but usually it's about 15 days . __eou__ do you eat any special food for the festival ? __eou__ yes , dumpling is a must.there is also other food.for example , people eat chicken for good luck . __eou__ that's interesting . i'm told the chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , it's really wonderful ! __eou__ oh , great ! i hope i can spend this spring festival with you here in beijing . __eou__ i'm sure you'll have a good time .
i've got an idea . let's make this game even more interesting . __eou__ how ? do you want to play strip-trivia or something ? __eou__ well , if you want to ! seriously , though , let's make a bet . __eou__ why don't we just make it a friendly game ? __eou__ don't be such a chicken ! whoever loses has to treat everyone to a movie .
is there anything worth watching on another channel ? __eou__ i think there ’ s a western on . __eou__ do you mind if we watch it . i ’ d really like to see it . __eou__ well , i really wanted to see the football game . __eou__ football game ? ok , and you know what comes on next ? __eou__ i believe there ’ s a sitcom . __eou__ are you interested in watching it ? __eou__ let me look in the tv guide first . __eou__ oh , i am sorry . what's on channel 2 at 10 pm ? __eou__ if i remember correctly , it's a quiz show . __eou__ do you want to watch it ? __eou__ let's watch it together .
jason , it's your turn . __eou__ i hope i get an easy question like you did . __eou__ you rolled a four . let's see ... you landed on foreign films . __eou__ oh , great . that's just my luck ! i hate those arty movies . __eou__ well , too bad . so , what foreign film won an oscar in 1993 ? __eou__ oh , please ! i have no idea . __eou__ the answer is belle opaque . it's a spanish movie , and the title means the age of beauty in english .
great ! i landed on classic movies . __eou__ i didn't know you liked old movies . __eou__ i love them , especially the all-time greats like gone with the wind . __eou__ you're so right ! today's movies are just too commercial ! __eou__ sometimes i think oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money .
we're in big trouble , jason . nick is beating us by a long shot . __eou__ impossible ! well , i'm not giving up yet . it's not over till the fat lady sings ! __eou__ ok , comeback kid . here's you last question.how many times did robin williams win the oscar for best actor ? __eou__ hmm . let's see ... there was good morning , vietnam , dead poet's society , the fisher king ... three , right ? __eou__ nope , sorry ! actually , robin williams has never won an oscar for best actor--only for best supporting actor !
i suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? __eou__ yes , i do . the look of a picture is very important . __eou__ i think sound is even more important ! guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! __eou__ you wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . __eou__ in my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . __eou__ enough ! if we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight !
i can't believe it ! i lost . __eou__ it looks like you have to buy tickets for us , jason . and we're not going to see an action movie ! __eou__ that's not fair , you got all the easy questions . __eou__ i guess that's just the luck of the draw . __eou__ i want a rematch . let's play again . __eou__ sorry , not tonight !
ok , nick . here's the question , what movie and its sequel both won an oscar for best picture ? __eou__ the godfather and the godfather ii , of course . they were both directed by francis ford coppola . __eou__ whew ! i'm impressed ! you really know your stuff ! __eou__ only about old movies , really ...
all right , let's see who's ruining my tv time . __eou__ what are you going to do ? call my boss and chew him out ? __eou__ is your boss named vic ? your pager says , this is vic . here i come ! __eou__ impossible . my pager is really old . it doesn't display messages . __eou__ here , see for yourself . that's really strange ! it's almost the same as when i ... __eou__ gosh , you're right ! it's from some guy named vic . i wonder who he is ...
what's wrong ? you don't like ancient egypt ? __eou__ actually , i don't like history . lately , these shows are always about the pyramids . __eou__ the pyramids are amazing ! millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ... __eou__ and nobody knows who built them , right ? it's a total mystery ! __eou__ you sound like the tv ! you're not going to tell me that aliens built the pyramids , are you ?
what upsets you ? __eou__ my parents called . as usual , they reminded me again that i should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.easier set than done . who should i marry ? i have no time to go on a date . __eou__ it is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ i will find one myself , of course . i ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ you mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , i hate that idea . __eou__ no , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . i know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . you can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ i don ’ t think it makes sense . three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ i think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ anyway , i don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ don ’ t worry . there are many other options using the internet as dating methods . some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . __eou__ of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . but all in all , it is more serious and professional . the chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ i don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . i ’ m not knowing who is reading it .
i'll tell you something that's good about action movies . the special effects are great ! __eou__ but they are so silly ! they're not art ! __eou__ that's just your personal prejudice . do you know who was the director of the movie titanic ? __eou__ james cameron , of course . __eou__ well , did you know he was also the director of the terminator ? __eou__ well , nobody's perfect !
doris , helen mall is having a big sale this weekend . do you wanna go ? __eou__ don't feel like it . i'm broke . __eou__ well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ? __eou__ just look around ? nah , that ’ s boring . __eou__ i'll go by myself then .
i never watch foreign films . they're too boring . __eou__ jason , you have no taste . you think first blood is a good movie . __eou__ hey , it is ! a lot of people like that movie ! __eou__ i'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . the plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written . __eou__ face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob . __eou__ no , i don't like action movies because i'm cultured !
how's your new job going ? __eou__ really well , thanks . __eou__ how are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ she's not bad . she's a bit bossy , but i'm sure i'll get used to her . __eou__ would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ she's far better than my old boss . he didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ how about your new co-workers ? __eou__ they are all pretty easy-going . it's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ of course . i spent so much time at my old workplace that i got to know them all very well . they were like family to me . __eou__ do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ sure . since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ do you like working in teams ? __eou__ i prefer it to working independently . i think most people do .
hi , my name's abby . what's your name ? __eou__ i'm colin . it's nice to meet you . what do you do ? __eou__ i'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ? __eou__ i'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ i'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field . __eou__ have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ? __eou__ no . is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__ not if you are good at net-working . do you like to meet new people ? __eou__ yes . i'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__ do you have experience in the it field ? __eou__ i have some . i worked in the it department at a language school for four years in spain . __eou__ do you speak spanish ? __eou__ yes , but not fluently . __eou__ that's ok . have you sent your cv out to anyone yet ? __eou__ i've sent my cv to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__ did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__ no , because i didn't know what i wanted to do . __eou__ i think you need to update your cv . bring it over to my office tomorrow and i'll help you with it . __eou__ thanks , i will . i'll see you tomorrow then !
ok . i'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . what about you , nick ? __eou__ sure . do you want to go first , sally ? __eou__ why not ! i rolled a five . the category is best pictures . __eou__ ok , here's your question what movie won the 1996 oscar for best picture ? __eou__ i know that , it's the english patient . it was one of the only good american movies of the 90s . __eou__ well , along with jurassic park ! nice going , you got the right answer .
how did your interview go ? __eou__ pretty well . i don't know if i'll get the promotion or not , but i feel good about it . __eou__ if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__ if i get the promotion , i will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__ will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__ whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__ that makes sense . who interviewed you ? __eou__ my boss . __eou__ what kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what i thought a good boss should be . __eou__ the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . what did you tell her ? __eou__ i told her that i'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ those are good answers . how did she react ? __eou__ she told me that even when i become a senior engineer , i'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ what do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ she's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ you're lucky . not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ that's true . she's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ i will do .
hi , ellen . that outfit looks terrific ! __eou__ thanks , jim . i didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . __eou__ no , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! __eou__ well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
jack ! do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? __eou__ sure . i thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! __eou__ well , this is my new baby . he ’ s just as much trouble . that ’ s for sure ! but , he ’ s a lot of fun ! __eou__ i see what you mean . he ’ s really cute . how old is he ?
hi , alex . how are you doing ? __eou__ just fine , karen . i ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! __eou__ i know the feeling . i ’ m calling to let you know about this new italian place i found . it ’ s right around the corner . __eou__ i ’ ll have to try it . you know how i am about italian food ! what ’ s the name ?
melissa ? i ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . __eou__ thanks , frank . i ’ d love to come . when is it ? __eou__ her birthday is on the 9th . we ’ re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . __eou__ sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
you're right--italian ! ha ! ha ! i was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! __eou__ i almost did ! actually , i don't know that much about coffee , even though i sell it . __eou__ i could give you a few pointers if you want . i know a lot about coffee . __eou__ thanks . maybe if things slow down later i'll stop by your table . __eou__ i'm robert , at your service . __eou__ rita . nice to meet you .
how are you , kim ? i haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . __eou__ oh , i was out sick most of last week . i ’ m still not completely over it . you ’ d better not get too close ! __eou__ i ’ m sorry to hear about that . why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? it ’ ll be good for you ! __eou__ sure , why not ? i could use a rest .
my buddha ! ! it's beautiful ! but i thought you were afraid ? __eou__ actually , i was watching your auction all along . i saw you drop out at $ 250 . __eou__ you sneak ! __eou__ i watched buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . i waited until the very last minute and then i jumped in at $ 325 ! i sniped him ! __eou__ but that's a lot of money ! honey !
well , the way you drive , jen ... i still don't think that's a good idea . __eou__ i really love this music . it's a compilation . __eou__ i know . it's a mix of all the latest songs . __eou__ and you got them off the net ? __eou__ no . i recorded these from your cds . __eou__ well , thanks for asking for my permission ... now hand it over and let me record ! __eou__ i knew i shouldn't have shown you my new toy ...
ok , dead man . if this doesn't start your engine , nothing will . __eou__ thank you . hey , do you know how espresso got its name ? __eou__ no , i don't . __eou__ it's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . es-press-o , get it ? __eou__ uh , are you sure about that ? i thought espresso was an italian word .
espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . it's strong . __eou__ ok , ok , this is good . keep talking . what about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? __eou__ cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth . __eou__ froth ? __eou__ if you want something manly , stick with the espresso . __eou__ thanks , hugh . i owe you one .
i think you're being a little naive . __eou__ if i want , i can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until i receive the item . __eou__ that proves my point ! protect yourself or you'll get burned . __eou__ ebay also offers free insurance . you can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase . __eou__ $ 200 ? if they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! i had a friend who ...
who got ripped off ? __eou__ big time ! a hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . you really think it's completely safe ? __eou__ well , maybe not 100 percent . i did hear about some tricks people use . __eou__ now we're getting to the truth . __eou__ there are shills . a shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale . __eou__ see ? and i bet that's easy to do online . everybody's anonymous .
i'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... __eou__ why ? do you have a robot girlfriend ? __eou__ not yet ... i got an mp3 player and a set of stereo headphones . __eou__ so you can download mp3 music from the net and record it onto the mp3 chip ? __eou__ yep ! and take it with me anywhere ! and the music is free ! __eou__ let me see it ! it's so small !
three other people started to bid . one called himself buddhabuyer , so i knew he meant business . i raised my bid twice , but it kept going up . __eou__ how high did the price go ? __eou__ i don't know . i dropped out at $ 250 . __eou__ you didn't watch the end of the auction ? __eou__ no . it wasn't the super bargain i thought it was .
what does this have to do with me ? __eou__ you know all about coffee . i need your advice , so i won't look stupid when i order . __eou__ order tea . isn't that what you like to drink ? __eou__ come on , hugh ! tea is for wimps ! please , i need your help . __eou__ if you want to be macho , order a double shot of espresso . __eou__ now you're talking . that sounds good . what is it ?
i'm more worried about snipers . __eou__ snipers ? __eou__ sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . __eou__ so you're afraid someone is going to snipe your buddha ? __eou__ i heard about a software program called turbid . it automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . __eou__ count me out . i can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders .
i have something really cool to tell you about ! do you know anything about online auctions ? __eou__ not really . __eou__ they're awesome ! i was browsing through the ebay auction today , and i found the cutest fat little copper buddha ! it's over a hundred years old . __eou__ please don't tell me you bought it . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ if you did , you probably got ripped off .
too ... your face is really oily ... perfect ! __eou__ why ? are you planning to stir-fry my face ? __eou__ nope . i'm going to tell your fortune . so ... the oilier , the better . __eou__ you've gone bonkers , jen . __eou__ it's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! it's magical . __eou__ ok . let's see . give me a sheet .
yeah . just pull on this strip . then peel off the back . __eou__ you might make a few enemies this way . __eou__ if they don't think this is fun , they're not meant to be our friends . __eou__ you mean your friends . i think it's cruel . __eou__ yeah . but it's fun . look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ? __eou__ hurry ! get a shot ! ... hand it over ! __eou__ i knew you'd come around ...
look , the aliens are sending a message to mulder . this rocks ! __eou__ whoops . that's my pager . i had to get it for work . __eou__ you have a pager ? ! that's a little high-tech for you , stu . are you sure you know how to use it ? __eou__ well , i know how to turn it off ! __eou__ no , you don't ! it's still beeping ! come on , hand it over and i'll turn it off for you .
you're so witty ... __eou__ so why is the face tilted to the right ? __eou__ this watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . __eou__ so it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? __eou__ it's better for right-handed people like me . see , i don't even have to move my arm to see the time . __eou__ i'm left-handed . you bought that watch so that i won't borrow it ... __eou__ bingo !
well , humans could never make something like that . __eou__ those poor egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! __eou__ be a little more open-minded , stu ! don't believe everything you read in your history books ! __eou__ ok , but don't believe everything you see on the x-files , either ! __eou__ speaking of the x-files , it's on right now !
what are you hiding in your coat pocket ? __eou__ it's a camera . __eou__ you want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ? __eou__ not even funny , billy . this is my new snapshot sticker camera . __eou__ what's that supposed to mean ? __eou__ well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . you can stick them anywhere .
michael johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . __eou__ if i were on as many steroids as he was , i think i ’ d be powerful , too . __eou__ what are you talking about ? ! he ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! __eou__ those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! he probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . __eou__ just because ben johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . __eou__ ok , ok . i ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . let ’ s get something to drink .
hey , look ! they ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 olympics . __eou__ isn ’ t that michael johnson ? i think he set a world record in this race . __eou__ he completed the first 200 / 400 double in olympic history ! __eou__ are you sure ? what about carl lewis ? he won four golds , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . __eou__ i like the way carl runs . he looks more graceful .
are you ready for the big competition today , todd ? the winner gets two tickets to the sydney olympics ! __eou__ steve , i was born ready ! i ’ m going to blow you guys off the treadmill today . __eou__ we ’ ve still got a lot of time before we have to start running . __eou__ let ’ s hit the whirlpool for a bit . it ’ ll help me loosen up . __eou__ you bet . i used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home .
anyone home ? jen ! __eou__ i'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! __eou__ wow ! you're really working up a storm ! __eou__ i know . i've even worked up a sweat . __eou__ you look like a cooking show host--only messier .
what's the matter with you , paul ? __eou__ i'm not feeling well . i think i'm having a cold . __eou__ looks like it.you need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . __eou__ yeah , i will .
do you have cold medicine ? __eou__ yes , but do you have a prescription with you ? __eou__ no , i don't . __eou__ i'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor . __eou__ i have a headache . is there anything i can buy without a prescription ? __eou__ then you can buy aspirin . __eou__ i will take the aspirin then . and have you a small first-aid kit ? __eou__ yes , here this is . __eou__ i'll take it too . __eou__ thank you and take care .
you look pale , paul.what ' s wrong ? __eou__ i've got a headache . __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that.anything i can do for you ? __eou__ no , thank you . i'll take an aspirin and see how it goes .
i can't even imagine you snorkeling ! __eou__ well , you'll see . with this new watch , i can go anywhere , do anything . __eou__ ok , bond . __eou__ no , really . look . it's got a double time zone setting . __eou__ so you can always keep two times at once ? __eou__ yep . i just can't decide what two cities to choose ... __eou__ the only two times you need are i'm late and i'm really late .
you didn't come to work yesterday.what happened ? __eou__ i had to look after my son at home . __eou__ what's wrong with him ? __eou__ he has a fever . __eou__ is he getting better now ? __eou__ i think so.thank you .
i heard you've found a new job . __eou__ yes , i'm now working in a company . __eou__ so you're quite happy with your new job ? __eou__ right . i enjoy what i'm doing .
and what's your vision ? __eou__ 20/350 . __eou__ mine's 20/20 . life just isn't fair , is it ? __eou__ oh , yes , it is . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ you'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom ... __eou__ they don't have toilets at the campground ? __eou__ let's just say i'll have it easy ...
hey , check out this new game i bought today . __eou__ wow ! it's a trivia game all about the academy awards . __eou__ i know you love the oscars . this game has some great questions about all types of movies . __eou__ does it have questions about foreign language films ? there's hardly any american films worth watching . __eou__ yes . in fact , one of the categories is on foreign language films .
isabelle , you know i'm not interested in fame . __eou__ well , you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job , either . __eou__ you know i'm interested in teaching . i'm looking for jazz students ... __eou__ yeah , and every high school student in town is banging on your door , right ? __eou__ i know they're out there . i'll find them . __eou__ you're such a dreamer ! you think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ?
yeah , it's really cute . but why a monkey suit ? is hello kitty having an identity complex ? __eou__ no , she's wearing my chinese zodiac sign . __eou__ you were born in the year of the monkey ? __eou__ yeah , are you surprised ? __eou__ not at all ! that explains everything !
are you ready for the camping trip ? __eou__ all set . i've got my makeup , my cds , and my portable tv set ... __eou__ hello ! we're supposed to be getting back to nature . __eou__ yeah , yeah . anyway ... i'm packed . are you ? __eou__ i've been packed for a week . all my stuff is in this backpack . __eou__ let me see ... two books ... birdseed ? __eou__ that's trail mix ! __eou__ same difference . what's this ?
my disposable contact lenses . they're great for camping ! __eou__ cool ! each contact comes in its own saline solution ? __eou__ yep . they're prescription contacts with uv protection . __eou__ wow ! how high-class ... a new pair for each day ... __eou__ you just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . no cleaning ! __eou__ cool . so are you near-sighted or far-sighted ? __eou__ near sighted .
i met a girl in elevator this morning . she works in a company upstairs . she said she envied the casual way we dress for work . she complained about the dress rule in her company . it requires everyone to wear formal clothes from monday to friday . __eou__ well , i was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . now , i know the answer . __eou__ you know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__ to some extent , it is . anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__ but it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . if they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .
have you signed up to join the company ’ s christmas party ? __eou__ sure , i have . will you join ? __eou__ i will . you know , as a newcomer , i think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . __eou__ you are right . our company ’ s christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . it is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . __eou__ i hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . __eou__ no , it will not be formal at all . it is a fun time . you will love the game show . please dress casually . usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . __eou__ don ’ t worry , i can handle that . and i know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him .
welcome to my birthday party , i am so happy you can come . __eou__ thanks for inviting me . here is the gift for you . happy birthday , francis ! many more happy and healthy years for you ! __eou__ thank you , shall i open it now ? __eou__ yes , please do . __eou__ wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . i really like it . that is so nice of you . __eou__ yeah , i was really struggling whether i should give you this nice little car . it was the last one they had and i really like it so much myself . __eou__ typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . the more i appreciate the gift now .
have you noticed the mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? __eou__ you mean the one with the yellow bricks ? but last time i saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . i saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . is it open now ? __eou__ yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when i passed by this morning.so , let ’ s have a try . my treat . __eou__ great , i like the idea of trying some new food . __eou__ good for you . today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . __eou__ also some traditional chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . i heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . __eou__ for sure all the customers will benefit from this .
i am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . when would you have time ? and what kind of food do you fancy ? __eou__ that would be great . i am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . any special reason for the invitation ? __eou__ to thank you for helping me at work last week . if you would not have been so kind , i would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . you really did me a big favor . thank you so much . __eou__ it was my pleasure . how about this evening ? i feel very hungry now . __eou__ fine , i know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . shall we try that one ? __eou__ ok with me . you are the boss . i will meet you downstairs after work .
have you heard that we will have reorganization ? __eou__ no , really ? __eou__ yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__ who will be there ? __eou__ james is going to be packed off there . __eou__ that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
i heard that james was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . __eou__ that ’ s open secret . __eou__ but mine could be a lie for his job . __eou__ how did you know that ? __eou__ a little bird whispered to me . keep that to yourself .
come on in . i am so glad you are here . we have been expecting you . __eou__ am i late for the party ? looks everyone is already here . hope i didn ’ t miss something interesting . __eou__ no , you are just on time . we haven ’ t really started yet . __eou__ great , here are some flowers for you . i hope you like them . i was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . __eou__ thank you , they ’ re beautiful . you can hang your coat over there . try this new couch , it is so comfortable . you will love it . want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or cola ? __eou__ don ’ t bother . i will help myself . __eou__ make yourself at home . __eou__ it is such a nice place . __eou__ well , i don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen .
are you doing something on saturday evening ? if not , welcome to my new apartment . __eou__ you moved to a new place ? __eou__ yes , i have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . right now , it looks like a home . i would like to have a small celebration party . please do come . __eou__ thank you for inviting me . sounds lovely ! i would like to come . where is your new apartment ? __eou__ it is in the dx community , room 306 , no . 2 building . it is very easy to find . just ask the guard at the entrance . __eou__ who else will come ? __eou__ i invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , paul . he is a very good person . you should meet him . __eou__ ok , i will be there around 6 . is that ok for you ? __eou__ yes , great . i am happy you are coming .
any idea about james ? he ’ s a pain in the neck . __eou__ guess what ? he has just got the sack . __eou__ oh , is that so ? __eou__ exactly .
i am thinking about resigning from my current job . __eou__ have you thought about it seriously ? __eou__ yes , i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday . __eou__ ok , did you find a new company ? __eou__ yes , i will move on to xyz company . __eou__ good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you . __eou__ thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
hi , lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ thank you for saying so . i don ’ t know , probably because i like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . i think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__ sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . people may think you are telling them how to do their work . if they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ that is true . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . for example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . to show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ you are quite right . thank you for sharing your experience with me . i learned a lot . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
i am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . we just made a record sale this season . __eou__ that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say , the r & d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__ it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__ that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers , young people will love it . __eou__ certainly .
i am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? __eou__ well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . there are so many good choices . __eou__ the problem is that i find all of them are full of fun . i just don ’ t know what to do first . __eou__ why not start with the most interesting one ? __eou__ actually , i ’ m interested in all of them . the more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . __eou__ toss a coin to decide then .
i ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . __eou__ it ’ s my pleasure . i enjoyed working with you . __eou__ i wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__ then keep up the good work .
congratulations ! i heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . __eou__ thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__ sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us . __eou__ yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . __eou__ well , good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__ i will do my best .
is the view going to be ok ? __eou__ don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__ i ’ ll do my best . __eou__ that ’ s the way to go .
did you sign up for the picnic party ? __eou__ yes , of course . i love the picnic party . it ’ s really family fun time . __eou__ this time you can bring your daughter with you . __eou__ right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . __eou__ there are times of games planned , should have a grand time .
have you ever been to xi ’ an ? __eou__ yes , i ’ ve been there several times on business trips . but i have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . __eou__ i ’ ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . i really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . of course i won ’ t miss the local food either . you know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . __eou__ i agree . as long as the food is not too bizarre once i saw some people eating insects . that is frightening . __eou__ sure it is . is it convenient to get there by plane ? __eou__ well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .
i wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . they are working very hard these days . maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . __eou__ that is a good idea , i love it . what time do you think is convenient ? __eou__ well , what about this thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? __eou__ ok , i will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . it has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . i am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . __eou__ i hope so . let me know how many will come . then i will book the restaurant .
lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? __eou__ i guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . but i have to be honest . it is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . therefore , i will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . you know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . so i would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . for which i can also save some tax . last of the list , i also consider the safety . __eou__ what about the environmental factors ? __eou__ well , i do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . __eou__ sure they are . some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . some of these green cars have not become standard . so the production costs are still high . but anyway , we should make efforts to start with .
who wants to go first ? allen ? __eou__ uh ... i mostly just like to listen . you're the groom . why don't you go first ? __eou__ ok . put on something by the backstreet boys ! __eou__ how about as long as you love me ! you can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee brooke ! __eou__ i'd better not . brooke hates the backstreet boys !
let ’ s call it a day . __eou__ it ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__ it ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__ sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
how are you feeling , champ ? ready to go ? __eou__ you know , if i can keep up my workouts , i think i have a chance in 2004 . __eou__ in what ? __eou__ in gymnastics . i'm pretty flexible . look ! i can even touch my toes ! __eou__ can you do the vault ? __eou__ i do back flips at the pool all the time .
did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? __eou__ are you sure ? how do you know ? __eou__ well , usually people think i'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say i sound a lot better ! __eou__ well , i heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ...
here we are , ryan ! this is where we're going to celebrate ! __eou__ it's a etv palace ! i'm glad i brought my platinum card . __eou__ you won't need it . stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! __eou__ where is stanley ? it was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a etv , wasn't it ? __eou__ if it were up to stanley , we'd have the wedding in the etv ! he loves to sing . __eou__ then i bet he's really good ! __eou__ well , uh , i'll let you decide that for yourself . he'll be here a little later . here's our room !
i don't know . i think you might be over the hill . __eou__ well , if not gymnastics , then mountain biking . __eou__ mountain biking is an olympic sport ? __eou__ since 1996 it has been . and i bet i'd be pretty good at it . i ride my mountain bike to work almost every day .
how do i look in this new dress ? __eou__ you ’ d better change it . it ’ s ugly . __eou__ how about this one ? __eou__ it ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well .
thanks for the pizza . it was delicious . __eou__ it's okay . __eou__ next time , it's on me . __eou__ don't be silly . __eou__ i'm serious . __eou__ alright . next time , we can try some other flavors . __eou__ certainly . the vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . it must be very delicious . __eou__ definitely . i really like italian food .
i remember you said that you like china because it has cheap beers . __eou__ yes , unbelievably cheap . carlsborg is less than $ 1 . __eou__ why do you drink ? i mean , where does drinking get you ? __eou__ it's fashionable . __eou__ come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . __eou__ mary , it's not about the blind following . what matter is i enjoy in drinking . it's like when you get off of work . you're so tired . you need to get relaxed . you can't just turn on the tv and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . you need to make your after work time more fun . __eou__ how ? by drinking ? __eou__ drinking is just part of it . i mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . you drink and talk . and the more you drink , the more you talk . it makes me so relaxed . __eou__ when did you begin to drink ? __eou__ it's a long time ago . when i first went to a bar to pick up girls there , i saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . then i went up to her and said ' can i buy you a drink ? ' __eou__ and then ? __eou__ then i talked to her and got her number . you know what ? when you don't know what to say ? just drink . __eou__ so you get drunk every day ?
who is it ? __eou__ open the door . it's me . i can't find the key . __eou__ you're always so careless . __eou__ oh , thank you . i am exhausted . will you bring me a cup of tea ? __eou__ okay , but i haven't prepare supper . __eou__ so let's eat out . __eou__ what do you want to eat ? __eou__ noodles . how about you ? __eou__ dumplings .
if i can improve my vertical jump a few more inches , i think beach volleyball might be my ticket . __eou__ but whenever we play , you just sit on the sand , drink beer , and watch the girls ! __eou__ it's a beautiful sport , isn't it ? __eou__ to be honest , i don't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch ! __eou__ ok , ok . enough already . we'd better hustle . the contest starts in five minutes .
you've heard of bruce jenner , haven't you ? __eou__ he won the decathlon in the 1976 olympics , right ? __eou__ i read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . __eou__ i can think of better things to dream about ... __eou__ sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . __eou__ that's crazy .
are you ready , honey ? __eou__ sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party . __eou__ just dress formal . __eou__ how about transom ? __eou__ it is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner . __eou__ oh , i nearly forget it . __eou__ you can put on your white shoes , it fits every occasion .
which season do you like best ? __eou__ i like spring best . it is neither too cold nor too hot . freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . how about you ? __eou__ i prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . when the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . after a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . it is also a best reason for ice-cream . __eou__ how do you get through the stuffy daytime ? __eou__ well , i have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time .
i am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? __eou__ fantastic ! i enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . the only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . once i nearly got burnt by a cigarette . __eou__ how did that happen ? __eou__ a wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . if i had drunk enough and i would have had the bold to punch him in the face . __eou__ sounds cool ! but that is not what a lady should do . people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk .
would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? __eou__ sorry , i have to work overtime . __eou__ you are really career minded . __eou__ my boss promised to pay me double time .
have you ever played making ? __eou__ not really , but i know it is very popular a traditional chinese gambling game . __eou__ yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . i tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . so i went to watch people play yesterday only to find i was even more confused . i think i have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . practice makes the master . __eou__ typical francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . __eou__ it is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active .
so , monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? __eou__ actually , i had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . i woke up this morning and found it was sunny . so i called lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . we were going to look for a new purse . now it turned out to be like this . neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . __eou__ that ’ s too bad . i hate sand storms too . it can be worse than any kind of bad weather . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with climate ? anyway , i think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . can ’ t people do something to stop it ? __eou__ it is not an easy job . the government is working on it . lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . but of course , it will not work overnight . so , have you come out with a new plan for today ? __eou__ my new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .
you didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . what ’ s up ? __eou__ well , i just came in . i worked overtime yesterday . some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . so i stayed to double check them . the boss was aware of my very late work of last night . so before he left office , he told me i could come one hour later this morning . __eou__ but you still look a little bit tired . what time did you leave ? __eou__ it was around one thirty in the morning . i guess i didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . i just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . __eou__ that ’ s normal after a tense work evening . working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . once , i worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . that really broke my rhythm and i got a little sick later . __eou__ working at weekend is something i hate to do most . __eou__ but if the company asks , what else can we do ?
have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? __eou__ yes , i have a very special one . i will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . a friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . i was very interested . so i asked him to get me the application form . lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . __eou__ volunteer in a zoo ? what specific things will you do ? __eou__ i will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . i ’ m very excited about it now . __eou__ it must be a unique experience . i ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . __eou__ ok , i will bring you photos as many as possible .
how about the hiking ? it was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? __eou__ can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . we had a lot of fun there . there was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . we arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . __eou__ you had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? __eou__ of course not ! we built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . we went sliding on the nice hill . it was a real work out . at noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . you must come with us next time . i bet you will love it . __eou__ well . you know i hate walking , but i can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video .
would you like to go skiing with me ? i heard the new ski area is great . they have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . i think it suits you best . __eou__ sounds not bad ! you know , the only thing i worried about is the safety . i ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . __eou__ then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . there ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . __eou__ i will think about it . __eou__ come on ! it is really a fun game .
a friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . he told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . he recommended me to subscribe to it . what do you say ? __eou__ i think it is good if we know enough about career planning . we will make wiser choices . what else did he tell you about it ? __eou__ well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__ sounds practical ! to be honest , sometimes i feel puzzled about my future career . i am not sure if this job suits me the best though i work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . i have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__ making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . it seems that you need this course more than i do . i love my current job . if i take this course , i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . i need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__ ok , then we can sign up for it together .
look at this survey conducted by a website . a quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . hi , francis , what about you ? __eou__ well , i just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . anyway , i have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , i don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ but it is lucky for us . the company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . i have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ well , keep a low profile .
how long have you been in this company ? __eou__ i came two years ago after i graduated from college . this is my first job . __eou__ you must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . __eou__ of course ! everyday , there is a deadline to meet . bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . it is so busy . but anyway , i have trying my best to be a good employee . __eou__ well , you ’ ve adapted yourself very well . everyone in our office thinks you ’ ve made a great progress in the past two years . what is your secret ? __eou__ it is so encouraging to hear this remark . the secret is to make plans . write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . then just work hard .
do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? __eou__ how regular ? __eou__ an average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__ you are kidding me ? it is against the labor law . they should be aware of their rights . __eou__ but these people say nothing about that . they are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__ that ’ s not right , somebody should do something .
i bought it . i got a watch , too . the company that sells this car has a car club . __eou__ where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? __eou__ yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! __eou__ cool ! __eou__ i know girls love this kind of car . look , it's got a sunroof ! imagine ... a cool , starry night ... __eou__ so , you're going to use sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? __eou__ no . i borrowed it to go shopping .
and lots of dear abby sob stories ... __eou__ hey ! i learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! __eou__ no wonder you're such a wacko ... __eou__ whatever ... smell ! perfume samples ! __eou__ nice . hey , i like the layout of this page ... __eou__ you mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... hello ?
are you ready to go shopping ? __eou__ not yet . i'm not finished with my research yet . __eou__ what research ? __eou__ reading my fashion magazines ! how do you think i know so much about all the latest trends ? __eou__ but they're just ads . __eou__ duh ... that's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what's in . plus , there are articles on new trends .
how was your job at the state-owned enterprise ? __eou__ oh , i no longer work there . i'm working with a multi-national corporation . __eou__ you changed jobs again ? why do you move so frequently ? __eou__ i want to try different things before i find the one i really like . __eou__ why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ? __eou__ i could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so i decided to move around and learn something new . __eou__ how's your current job going ? __eou__ i'm pretty satisfied with it . i can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities .
office software like windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . it saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . __eou__ fully agree . i do enjoy the convenience though i am still a beginner in using excel . the latest office equipment is more type-functional . it combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . it saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . __eou__ yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . __eou__ when will we get one of those ? __eou__ you know our boss always trying to save the last penny . we have to use up the equipment first .
gross ! what are you doing to yourself ? __eou__ chill ! i'm just curling my eyelashes . __eou__ it looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . __eou__ you're such a wimp ! you're afraid of an eyelash curler . __eou__ well , you might pinch your eyelid ! or lose an eyeball ! __eou__ it just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
i think i need a new notebook . __eou__ why ? is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? __eou__ you bet there is . feast your eyes on this puppy ! __eou__ that's a notebook ? __eou__ believe it ! __eou__ it looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase !
uh ... that's greek to me . __eou__ that means they have tapered legs . __eou__ well , mine are baggy . they're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . __eou__ mine are , too . __eou__ so maybe we shouldn't go out after all . __eou__ yeah . let's just lounge around !
just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear . __eou__ yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . __eou__ those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation . __eou__ so decode this for me , madame psycho . __eou__ that's madame psychic to you . __eou__ i'm waiting ... __eou__ well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . dress up and go on a date !
you know , mary , i feel we meet somewhere before . where were you born ? __eou__ i was born in beijing , but i spent most of my childhood in london . __eou__ what was your childhood like ? __eou__ i had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me . __eou__ where did you go to university ? __eou__ my parents wanted me to stay in beijing , but i decided to go back to england . i graduated from university of newcastle upon tyne with a degree in cross culture communication . __eou__ what is your current occupation ? __eou__ i am a journalist . i write for china daily .
tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think i should be wearing ? __eou__ well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . but sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . it depends on the company ’ s dress code . __eou__ indeed , i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview . only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . it seems that their dress code is not that formal . probably , i should put on car key and simple shirt . __eou__ whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .
have you heard anything about markweed inc . ? they have called me back for interview , and i'm considering taking a job with them . __eou__ well , to start with , markweed inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . __eou__ the best ... huh ? with so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? __eou__ first of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . __eou__ really ? what about the pay rate ? are the wages pretty high ? __eou__ from what i hear , they are very reasonable . a lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . __eou__ well , what about the work environment ? not every one is motivated solely by money . __eou__ it's a great place to work . they give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . i think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it .
check out these wheels ! __eou__ you bought a compact car ? __eou__ no , i borrowed it . __eou__ let me guess , from sarah . it looks like something she would drive . __eou__ you guessed right . besides , the color violet is a little girly for me . __eou__ i love it . it's so festive ! and where did you get that cup ? it's got the same logo .
i wonder what he looks like . oh , i can't wait to see him ! his email said he'd be wearing a white hat.oh , there he is . __eou__ hey , isabelle ... __eou__ logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! don't tell me you're the guy ! it can't be true . __eou__ yes , i am the guy ... __eou__ what a bummer ! you set me up ? __eou__ let me explain . i didn't mean to hurt you ...
that way they look longer . __eou__ now what are you doing ? __eou__ putting on mascara . __eou__ nasty . you'd better not rub your eyes . __eou__ i won't . __eou__ and you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .
i wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when susan resigned last week to work for the sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . __eou__ have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? if everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . __eou__ well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , i know sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . __eou__ inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . __eou__ with susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . __eou__ our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . __eou__ maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people .
do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? __eou__ let me see . laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... oh , that is too much . you are not going to a business trip . __eou__ i guess i need all of them . __eou__ actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . so , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . __eou__ i know . but it is my lucky charm . i carry it all the time . __eou__ suit yourself . don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock .
you mean it shuts off to save energy ? __eou__ yep . and it breathes , see ! __eou__ it's not breathing ! __eou__ yes , it is . look at the little light ! it blinks off and on . __eou__ jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . __eou__ i would look so cool carrying this around !
did you meet the new girl in our sales department . she is taking the place of maggie during her alternative leave . __eou__ did they finally fill that post , how come i haven't seen her ? she must have not been inducted yet . __eou__ i guess not , they haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday . __eou__ is she just working temporarily ? what are they going to do when maggie comes back from leave . __eou__ if the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes .
any plans tonight ? __eou__ not really , do you ? __eou__ well , i am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . you know , i just came back from a really tough interview . i was quite nervous during the interview . i really want to have the job . right now , i am still a little on the edge . i am not sure if i could convince them during the interview . __eou__ take it easy . it is all over now . how was it going , anyway ? __eou__ i don ’ t know . i think i did well in the paper exams . i was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as i expected . to my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the chinese poesy with me . __eou__ that ’ s strange . but probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ getting to know you more personally ” . what about your answers ? __eou__ just did my best .
have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? __eou__ yes , not bad . like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . __eou__ well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , i think it is not reasonable . what if there are some important calls ? __eou__ well , this one is not compulsory . it is just suggestion . __eou__ i didn ’ t pay attention to that .
i am totally fed up with my boss . he has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . this time i am really going to report him for sexual harassment . __eou__ what happened ? did your boss say something to offend you at work ? __eou__ he constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . i doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . __eou__ don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... __eou__ you ’ re missing the point . it ’ s about respect . he treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . it ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . __eou__ that ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . i think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . you probably won ’ t be able to change him .
hi , tina , i ’ ve got good news . i have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with abc company . they informed me to go to the final round next monday . it looks very promising . __eou__ that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it . __eou__ thanks . let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . are you free ? __eou__ yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5pm , ok ? __eou__ no problem . see you ! __eou__ see you !
i have made up my mind . i am getting a tattoo . __eou__ really ? are you sure ? __eou__ yeah ! why not ? they are trendy and look great ! i want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . __eou__ yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! they use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . on top of all that , i have heard it hurts a lot ! __eou__ really ? __eou__ of course ! they use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . __eou__ oh , i didn ’ t know that ! i thought they just paint it on your skin or something . __eou__ i think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . __eou__ maybe i should just get a tongue piercing !
i've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . you always give such amazing presentations , i was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . __eou__ sure , it's easy . first of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . people are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . __eou__ what kind of visuals should i use to support the presentation ? do you think i should use powerpoint ? __eou__ you should consider the size and interests of your audience . in other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a ppt with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . __eou__ i think i can put something together , no problem . but when it comes to tomorrow , i'll just be a bundle of nerves ! how can i get over my fear of speaking in public ? __eou__ you know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be !
hi , francis . __eou__ oh , mike . how are you doing ? __eou__ not bad . it seems you are super yogurt lover . you have so many in your cart . __eou__ well , i prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? it tastes great and very healthy too . __eou__ oh , i haven ’ t noticed that before . maybe i will try next time . __eou__ why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? i have more items than you . __eou__ thank you . in fact , i am in a hurry . my wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . it was good seeing you again . __eou__ me too . have a great day .
if only our company prescribe flex time . __eou__ the board has been considering introducing flex time . __eou__ good news . ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . __eou__ then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .
are you watching the soccer match tonight ? it must be the most exciting one in this season . __eou__ well , of course i can ’ t miss it . which team are you for ? __eou__ manchester united . what about you ? __eou__ me too . do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? __eou__ i have confidence in them .
are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ could you please get me a takeaway ? i have some urgent work to finish . so i don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . __eou__ no problem . what should i bring ? __eou__ i am not picky on food . just bring me the day menu .
i heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger . __eou__ that ’ s a matter of opinion . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ i worked with him for two years . that was the worst time in my career .
how would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ we have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ what do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
it's amazing to me how international business has become . take my store for example . on any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . __eou__ how many different varieties of products do you import from china ? __eou__ china provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . we import more than 40 different items from china . most of the imports that come out of china are low-grade plastics or toys . japan produces many electronic exports , germany produces excellent mechanical exports . __eou__ do you import any food items ? __eou__ generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . the only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . the shelf life is longer for these products .
what's the news on our website ? how effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? __eou__ we've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . __eou__ what kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? __eou__ from the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . that means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . based on these findings , i am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! __eou__ you really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.what about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? __eou__ well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... but i think they might be less important now than in the past . the technology age has arrived !
earning extra income on the internet is easier than you might think . after i started selling traditional craft items on the internet last year , i have really been able to make bank doing something i love . __eou__ is that right ? i hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . how can you be sure your idea will cash in ? __eou__ to run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . you've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . __eou__ that's marketing research ... but what about getting started once you have an idea ? __eou__ after you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . if you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . __eou__ sounds like a lot of work ! __eou__ anything worth doing takes work . money doesn't grow on trees ... most of us have to work for it .
i think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . the government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . __eou__ that's right . they always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . __eou__ well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but i think it's backfired . the immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . __eou__ the worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . it also leads to more unemployment in the long run . i don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... __eou__ i have a good solution ... we need some new blood ! we should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders !
fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . you can leave this job to jason . __eou__ yeah , he has a good commend of computer skills . but ... __eou__ but what ? __eou__ but he is always talking big .
did you hear what happened in the scott case ? some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . now every newspapers is all over it . __eou__ oh ... i bet the firm is fuming . do they know who spilled the beans ? __eou__ i'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . __eou__ what kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? __eou__ i'm sure there'll be canned ! and there also might be some legal consequences . __eou__ why would the person who told have problems with the law ? __eou__ because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . __eou__ i didn't think about that . that's pretty serious . are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? __eou__ i'm sure management is on top of it .
the new webpage design is much more effective than before . i feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . __eou__ why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? i thought the old page wasn't half bad ... __eou__ the old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . now it's different . we got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... __eou__ what changes were made from the old page to the new page ? __eou__ first , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . they can sign up for a free monthly drawing . once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . we also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... so far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... __eou__ great !
here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . there are about forty or so that are hot . you should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . the rest are categorized according to potential and interest.you can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . __eou__ haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . i hate making cold calls ... __eou__ don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . we've just got to make sure the hot ones are contacted right away . and even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . we've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . i don't want our investment to go down the drain . __eou__ don't worry , i've gotchy covered .
it's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... the trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , i really think we're headed for a recession . __eou__ the economy has been stagnant for a while now . we've been in a recessive state for several months already . what worries me the most is the trade deficit . i think the government should do more to encourage exports . __eou__ increasing exports would weaken the currency . i think the main point is economic growth . we need more jobs . factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . if more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . __eou__ it's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? if unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . that would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .
did you hear the news ? two of our major suppliers , murphy music and u-tunes are merging ! if they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy . __eou__ are you sure ? who told you that ? i highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... they're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.it must be a rumor.it can't be true . __eou__ i read it myself on the financial page.they ' re really going to join together . u-tunes was bought out by murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . __eou__ the competition must have been too stiff for u-tunes.otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? __eou__ i guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.if you can't beat'em , join'em .
i heard a rumor this morning ... it seems trusten tools is going out of business.another competitor is going bankrupt.that could be good news for us . __eou__ i think you must have heard wrong.the truth is we are going to be taken over by trusten.we are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.it ' s not good news at all ... __eou__ what ? we are merging with trusten ? i never thought that would happen.will we be getting new owners ? will it affect our jobs ? __eou__ probably.the new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.one of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . __eou__ wow , with such a big change.we won't have the same name ? __eou__ it's not only the name of our company that will change ... i expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air .
how many people are there in your family ? __eou__ five . besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . __eou__ that is a big family . how old is your sister ? __eou__ 15 . __eou__ what about your brother ? __eou__ he ’ s not quite 25 . __eou__ do you miss your family ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ do you often go home ? __eou__ no . but i write to them often . __eou__ how often do you write to them ? __eou__ once a month .
i really should be on my way . __eou__ oh , not yet . at least have one for the road . __eou__ no , thanks all the same . __eou__ well , i am sorry you have to leave so early . __eou__ thank you very much . we really had a good time . __eou__ well . thank you for coming . __eou__ so see you . __eou__ bye .
hi , jack . long time no see ! __eou__ yeah . how's everything going ? __eou__ not bad . at least i am still alive . __eou__ just alive ? i guess you are some lucky guy . i heard you are going out with jane . __eou__ where did you get that idea ? __eou__ oh , come on . jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . __eou__ you are right . i am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . __eou__ well , i really envy you for finding such a nice girl .
good morning , mr.black . i am the new secretary . __eou__ good morning , miss white . you are half an hour early . __eou__ i don't want to make a bad impression . __eou__ come on over . this is your desk , and this is your time card . be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . __eou__ i will . __eou__ one more thing , keep your desk neat . it's the rule . there is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . __eou__ i'll keep that in mind . does everything on the desk belong to me ? __eou__ not belong . you can use them as long as you work here . when you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . __eou__ what's the extension number for my phone ? __eou__ the operator will put all your calls through . you don't have to worry about that . __eou__ can i make personal phone calls during my office hours ? __eou__ of course you can . every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . what's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . __eou__ i understand . __eou__ when you settle down , i'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers .
hi , ann . i was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? __eou__ well , george . i guess i am . why do you ask ? __eou__ i've just gotten a pair of pre-sale star wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . are you interested ? __eou__ yeah , definitely ! thanks for inviting me . __eou__ my pleasure . __eou__ i really wanted to watch the star wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . how did you manage to get hold of them ? __eou__ a friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . he was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . __eou__ you paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? that's a huge premium over the regular price . __eou__ not really . considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . besides , i knew you were really looking forward to watching star wars on the opening day . __eou__ wow ! i am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . i really appreciate that . so , what time are we going ? __eou__ well , let's see . the movie stars at 10 . we should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . i could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . __eou__ 8 pm , that's fine with me . __eou__ okay . __eou__ so i'll see you tomorrow then at 8 . __eou__ yeah , that's great . i'll see you tomorrow night . __eou__ ok , george . bye ! __eou__ bye , ann !

good afternoon , would you mind if i sat here ? __eou__ of course not . __eou__ i ’ m jack . what ’ s your name ? __eou__ laura . __eou__ do you like this place ? __eou__ i don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . and my father doesn ’ t like it . but my mother likes it very much . so we often come here . __eou__ how often ? __eou__ well , we come here almost every month . __eou__ who ’ s that ? __eou__ it ’ s my mother . she ’ s fond of swimming . and the man beside her is my father . __eou__ do you like swimming ? __eou__ no , i hate swimming . i prefer playing tennis .

well , sir , we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . __eou__ is that so ? i didn't know it.can i possible borrow a jacket and a tie ? __eou__ i'm sorry you can't borrow a jacket and a tie . __eou__ then we return to the hotel and come back.will you change the appointment ? __eou__ certainly.what time will you come back ? __eou__ at seven , please . __eou__ how many in your party ? __eou__ a party of three . __eou__ all right.we are waiting for you at seven .

so , how's your work ? __eou__ good . how about you ? __eou__ i am going to resign . a few of the new staff have already left . obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . __eou__ but your company is huge . can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages . __eou__ but we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done . __eou__ that's shortsighted . by the time the workers are experienced and contributing . they are likely to go . __eou__ that's why i am going to leave . __eou__ but you have already worked there for five years . __eou__ i am worried about my future . i can't believe that our company is as big as it is . the company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff . __eou__ well . the management doesn't seem to think that way . anyways , you have to think twice before you act . __eou__ thank you . i will .
let's take a coffee break , shall we ? __eou__ i wish i could , but i can't . __eou__ what keeps you so busy ? you've been sitting there for hours . you've got to walk around.you just can't stay on the computer forever . __eou__ well , i am up to my neck in work . i've got to finish this report . sarah needs it by noon . i don't want to be scolded if i can ’ t finish my work by the deadline . __eou__ i understand that , but you'd feel better if you took a break , even for just a short while .

you look tired . __eou__ yeah , i've been working so much overtime lately . __eou__ really ? how come ? __eou__ my boss gave me a big project . i had to have it finished by this morning . it was so difficult . __eou__ you shouldn't work so hard . __eou__ i know , but hard work pays off . you know . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ maybe now i'll get that promotion i was hoping for .
shall i punch out for you , ross ? i am leaving now . __eou__ no , thanks . i have got to work overtime . __eou__ but today is friday . you are not going to work overtime on friday evening , are you ? __eou__ well , i am . i'll have to finish this report for next monday's meeting . is tom coming to pick you up ? __eou__ no . we ’ ll meet at my house . he invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . __eou__ that's nice . where is his villa ? __eou__ it's not his villa , but his father's . i think it's somewhere in florida . i am not sure myself . __eou__ sometimes i envy you a lot . tom is a good guy . __eou__ come on . you just haven ’ t met the right person and i think that you work too much . you should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . __eou__ i know , but i am a work maniac . __eou__ well , suit yourself . i've got to run now . __eou__ have a nice weekend . __eou__ you too . oh , i forgot to tell you one thing . a girl called this afternoon . she said she was your ex-girlfriend . she wanted you to call her back . __eou__ did she mention anything else ? __eou__ no , nothing else . see you monday . __eou__ see you .
did you see may today ? __eou__ yes , but why does she have such a long face ? __eou__ i don't have the foggiest idea . __eou__ i thought she'd be happy . __eou__ yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently . __eou__ i don't know . maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem .
well , that's it . 7 appointments in paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in frankfurt at the end of the week . __eou__ it's certainly a tight schedule . __eou__ now it's a question of getting there . i need a flight to paris on sunday evening and a hotel in paris for 3 nights . i have to be in frankfurt by 11 on thursday morning . and i will need a hotel for one night . i will head home on friday . __eou__ at what time ? __eou__ my last appointment is at 3 , so i should be free by 5 at the very latest . i think i could get to the airport by 6 . __eou__ do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? __eou__ no , not really . __eou__ so you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? __eou__ no , but i am sure it won't take more than an hour . __eou__ don't forget it's friday nighty . if frankfurt's anything like london , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . it will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . __eou__ you are a pessimist . __eou__ i am a realist .
hey rachael , what's up ? how is your day ? __eou__ not bad.we have had a big meeting today , remember ? __eou__ oh , yea . i forgot.so how did it go ? __eou__ pretty well . i think the boss liked my ideas . __eou__ great , so what happens now ? __eou__ well , i have to write the proposal . i'm pretty excited about it .

if you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . it's extremely bad for your health , you know . __eou__ i know it's not good for me , but the problem is i just can't help it . __eou__ well , i've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . it may give you a feeling to reduce it . __eou__ i'll try .

man , they take a lot of our paycheck . __eou__ yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ? __eou__ seriously . the only tax i don't mind them taking is social security . it's only a few dollars every paycheck . __eou__ yeah , i don't mind it either . we ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? __eou__ yeah . it won't be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . __eou__ yeah , my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . __eou__ let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it . __eou__ really ? no , they couldn't . none of them would have jobs if they did .

hey , mike . you've been surfing the net for quite a while . what on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ it's something relative hackers . i often hear people talking about them , but i don't know much about them . __eou__ well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ you mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ you can say that . __eou__ but why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ they must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ what is crackers then ? __eou__ there is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . they break into computers and break the phone system . real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ so they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . this irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ i see . then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ you got it . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ you are welcome .

lousy weather , isn't it ? __eou__ it has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . __eou__ look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . __eou__ and the streets are covered with snow . __eou__ do you know what the temperature is today ? __eou__ i missed today's weather forecast over the tv . __eou__ it feels like ten degrees below zero at least . i don't mind the cold weather but i do hate it when it gets slippery . __eou__ the ice will soon be thick enough for skating . i am so fond of winter sports . __eou__ that's great . let's go skating together tomorrow .
her dress looks funny . __eou__ i wouldn't say that . it looks fine to me . __eou__ are you kidding she is behind the times . that style went out last year . __eou__ oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her . __eou__ well , you ’ re really as out-dated as she is . __eou__ you ’ re darn right . i am out of style . so what what's the point of keeping yourself in style __eou__ no wonder you never buy me a new dress .
do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? __eou__ you mean like a breast enlargement ? i don't think that's really necessary . that's not the way a woman should stay attractive . __eou__ why not ? why can't we go back to the way things were ? __eou__ because ... i don't know . but , connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? __eou__ darned right i would ! __eou__ maybe make-up would be enough ? __eou__ come on , liz . be open-minded ! look at my eyes , they are puffy . and my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . i really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . __eou__ but what would other people think ? __eou__ i don't care what other people think . i am ready for a lift .
they are professors and government officials . __eou__ where are they from ? __eou__ most of them are from america and europe . __eou__ what are they doing in beijing ? __eou__ they are attending an international conference here . __eou__ which hotel are they staying at ? __eou__ they are staying at the hilton hotel .
how ’ s the food ? __eou__ it ’ s pretty good . __eou__ well i don ’ t think so . i don ’ t like it at all ! __eou__ i ’ m afraid you ’ re being too particular about your food . __eou__ i eat dog food when my parents are out . __eou__ we ’ re in the same boat ! i ’ ve eaten fast food the whole week . i hate it now . __eou__ poor us ! all this junk food lacks nutrition ! __eou__ let ’ s dine out tonight for a change ! __eou__ good idea !

television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ i try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ un ... i think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ well , i suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ yes , i think that is a danger , and i think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you know the television will be the main thing in the room .

you're late . __eou__ i know i'm late . i'm sorry . i tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . __eou__ my phone ? __eou__ yes . an automatic message says your phone is not in service . __eou__ really ? i had no idea . let me check.yes , it's dead . there's no dial tone . __eou__ so i couldn't get through . i knew i'd be late because my car wouldn't start.it was too cold i had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . that's why i'm late . __eou__ but this is terrible . i'm expecting important calls . __eou__ about what ? __eou__ you know what.the theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.they are supposed to call me this evening.if i don't have a phone . oh , what can i do ? __eou__ well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . __eou__ do you have a cell phone ? __eou__ no . i hate cell phones.but you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . __eou__ can you drive me ? i will go to ann's house . it isn't far . i can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.she will let us wait in her living room . __eou__ yes , of course i can drive you.so you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? __eou__ yes , i do.at ann's house i will call the phone company and have them check my line.if they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.but if not , i need to wait at ann's house to talk with the theater guild.it ' s very important to me . __eou__ alright , let's go . __eou__ yes , let's go .
did you hear ? the state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! __eou__ are you serious ? gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! it disgusts me . __eou__ what are you talking about ? how does it exploit people ? __eou__ well , to begin with , gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . people have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . __eou__ geez ! now that i think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! although , i have been to las vegas , and i didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . __eou__ you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . now excuse me , i have a protest rally to organize !
bill . bill ! you gotta help me ! __eou__ what ’ s wrong ? slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ tomorrow is christmas and i haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! i ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ take it easy ! let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ that ’ s just it ! i don ’ t know what to get her ! last year i got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! i suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ that ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! you can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! especially with clothes or jewelry . on top of that , i think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . at the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ yeah , you ’ re right . when it comes down to it , i can be pretty tacky . __eou__ yeah , tell me about it . i know ! your mom is trying to learn spanish , right ? why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website i saw called spanishpod . __eou__ now that ’ s a great idea !
honey , do you have a second ? __eou__ sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried.what ’ s on your mind ? __eou__ we need to talk . __eou__ okay ... __eou__ i ’ ve been thinking , and well , i think we need to start seeing other people . __eou__ what ? why ? i mean , we ’ ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ that ’ s just it , i ’ m not happy anymore , tim . it ’ s not you , it ’ s me . i know that i can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guythat any woman would kill for ! __eou__ so , what are you saying ? you ’ re breaking up with me because i ’ m perfect ? __eou__ tim , you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh , i could say that i ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . i know i ’ d only hurt you , i know i ’ d only make you cry . __eou__ baby , come on . don ’ t do this to me ! whatever it is , we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! don ’ t leave me . __eou__ i can ’ t , tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i ’ m only doing this for you . i don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do . __eou__ laura ... __eou__ here are your keys . i ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i ’ m sorry , tim . i wish you all the best , and i hope that one day we can meet again . i ’ ll always love you . goodbye .
joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? __eou__ fine with me . i just want to get this over with . it ’ s important we make a clean break . i should have signed a pre-nup . __eou__ what was that ? __eou__ nothing ! anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.my lawyer tells me you ’ ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - i keep the cat and you get the dog . so that ’ s done ... finally . __eou__ let ’ s not go there , joanne ! ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , i ’ ll take the albums i contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . __eou__ fine , but i ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . __eou__ i believe that was a wedding present to both of us , joanne . and you hardly ever use it ! __eou__ he ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__ whatever ! alright , i ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that i get the silver tea set . __eou__ how typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? fine ! i don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . what ’ s next ? what about these old photographs ? __eou__ which ones ? let me have a look.wow , look at that ! that brings back memories ... that ? __eou__ our trip to italy ! i remember that day . we were going to visit the trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... __eou__ ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . i had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... __eou__ oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__ oh , joanne , are we making a big mistake ? i know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? i still love you . __eou__ oh jeff ! i love you too ! i ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__ the motorcycle ? but that ’ s mine !
that was a great dinner . i didn't know that you knew how yo cook . __eou__ i'm glad you liked it . are you ready for dessert ? __eou__ i don't know . i'm pretty full . what are we having ? __eou__ i made strawberry shortcake . __eou__ ooh , that's my favorite . maybe i'll have a small slice . __eou__ great . would you like coffee or tea with that ? __eou__ i'll have a cup of tea . __eou__ do you take cream or sugar with your tea ? __eou__ actually , could i have some milk with that ? __eou__ definitely . would you like skim or whole milk ? __eou__ skim , please . that'd be very nice . thanks ... oh no . janna , i'm so sorry , but i've got to go . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ i just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . i need to go pick her up . __eou__ i'll go with you . where is she ? __eou__ she's on the m40 , near reading . __eou__ is she alright ? __eou__ i don't know , she didn't say . i'm so sorry about this . __eou__ don't worry . family comes first . come on , let's go . __eou__ actually , i've only got a two-seater . i'll have to go on my own . __eou__ ok . just call me if you need anything then . __eou__ i will . thanks a lot .

what are you listening to ? is that beethoven or mozart ? __eou__ it's beethoven . do you like it ? __eou__ i think beethoven's music is incredible . i've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . do you believe that ? __eou__ i don't know about that , but i do think that it helps people relax . __eou__ what other kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ actually , i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ? __eou__ to be honest , i think classical music is too complicated for me . __eou__ what kind of music do you prefer then ? __eou__ i like pop music . do you ? __eou__ not really . i don't think pop music has much depth . __eou__ i see what you mean . i think that's way i like it so much . __eou__ how long have you been in to pop music , then ? __eou__ i've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ? __eou__ not really . when i was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . __eou__ so , how did you become interested in it ? __eou__ well , when i was about 10 years old , i started playing the piano . i think that's how it all started . __eou__ do you still play piano ? __eou__ yes , it's one of my hobbies .
shall we go to cinema this evening ? the new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . it ’ s supposed to be really good . __eou__ what kind of movie is it ? i don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . __eou__ it ’ s a thriller . it has julia roberts playing the female lead . __eou__ i like thrillers and i like julia roberts , so it might be interesting . i read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . __eou__ what did the critic say ? __eou__ he didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . __eou__ the movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . __eou__ good . dinner is nearly ready and i ’ d like to watch the news before we go . the oscars were last night and i want to see the results . __eou__ i won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . there were a few surprises .
what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? __eou__ i like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . how about you ? __eou__ i like those kinds of programmes too . they ’ re very informative . i think that many people underrate the education value of tv . __eou__ i agree . people often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . __eou__ yeah . and that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! __eou__ right . you can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . they need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes . __eou__ in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . i think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . __eou__ that ’ s great idea . but don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? __eou__ no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? __eou__ not as far as i know . we have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! that ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo __eou__ some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes . __eou__ well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . shall we ?
what ’ s the plot of your new movie ? __eou__ it ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . i play the part of the detective . he has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . it ’ s a psychological th __eou__ did you enjoy making the movie ? we heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . __eou__ i have had disagreement with every director . i ’ ve worked with . we ’ ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . it was the same when i made this movie . i don ’ t no __eou__ critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ ve made recently . does that bother you ? __eou__ not at all . the feedback from audience has been great . i care about what they think more than what the critics think . __eou__ did you do you own stunts in the movie ? __eou__ i wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . all of my stunts were done by a stuntman . as you know , i used to do my own stunts , but i ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . __eou__ thank you very much for doing this interview . __eou__ my pleasure . have you seen the movie yet ? __eou__ yes . i have . i liked it very much . like you , i was very impressed with rachel ’ s performance in the movie . she ’ s going to be a star .
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ i went a global warming rally in london . it was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . you should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__ i think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ i had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment .
have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ yes , i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__ do you know where it measured on the richter scale ? __eou__ i don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ no , but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ i'm from the plains of the midwest . it's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__ did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__ most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__ wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__ actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__ have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__ no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car ! __eou__ that sure didn't last long !
how are you doing ? __eou__ i'm ok . i wish i could say the same for my friend . __eou__ what happened to him ? __eou__ he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . __eou__ was it his first offence ? __eou__ unfortunately not . he was charged with a dui when he was in university . __eou__ what happened to him then ? __eou__ not much ; it was a minor offence back then . he got away with a fine of $ 500 . __eou__ did they take his license away ? __eou__ no , they were really easy on him . the problem is that that was a long time ago . they are much tougher on crime now . __eou__ what do you think will happen to him ? __eou__ well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . __eou__ that doesn't sound too promising . does he have a defence lawyer ? __eou__ not yet . if we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . __eou__ my sister is a lawyer . i can ask her if she can help him . __eou__ that'd be great ! i know he'd appreciate your help .
which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? __eou__ i think housing is a big problem . there are thousands of homeless people on the streets . __eou__ how would you solve the problem ? __eou__ i have a good idea to solve it . the government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . __eou__ it would probably be very expensive . __eou__ i think the government can afford it . besides , there are many advantages . homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . they would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i __eou__ it ’ s not a bad idea . i think education is the biggest problem at the moment . schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . __eou__ if we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . that wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . __eou__ most voters what everything both ways . they want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . __eou__ the government should show that it is using money efficiently . sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . __eou__ yes . the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly
good morning . i ’ m from the new york book review . could i ask you some question about your latest book ? __eou__ sure . take a seat ... what would you like to know ? __eou__ first , i ’ ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . __eou__ that ’ s correct . it ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . the main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . __eou__ how do you research your books ? __eou__ i always visit the places that i use as setting for stories . readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! i usually base my characters on people i have met . most charact __eou__ i really like your books . i ’ ve just finished this one . i read it from cover to cover in a single day . congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! __eou__ thank you . let met sign it for you ... there you go . __eou__ oh ! thank you very much . i heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . what are the stories about ? __eou__ there ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . i haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . if you give me your __eou__ thanks very much . i ’ m sure it will sell well . i can ’ t wait to read it . here ’ s my card . thank you for you time .
i would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . __eou__ really ? i ’ m not sure that i would like all the attention . there have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . __eou__ i love being photographed ! if i were famous , i ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . __eou__ i wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . __eou__ no-one really believes gossip columnists . __eou__ i think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . you ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . if you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it __eou__ i think you ’ re right about that . i ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . i could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . __eou__ that ’ s a great idea . which charities would you support ? __eou__ i love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . __eou__ you ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . anyway , i ’ d be the first to buy your posters and i ’ d attend your first book - __eou__ thanks , but actually i was hoping i could ask you to write my biography .
you ’ re a big fan of andy lau , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , i ’ ve been got all his albums and most of his films on dvd . i adore him . he ’ s my idol . __eou__ how come you don ’ t have all of his films on dvd ? __eou__ some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . __eou__ i see . i ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . i see you also have several poster of him . __eou__ yes . these posters are new . i bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . __eou__ are you a member of his fan club ? __eou__ i was , but then i discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so i ’ m not a member now . __eou__ did you see the interview with andy lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? __eou__ of course ! i bought two copies . __eou__ two copies ? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ?
i think that show biz stars have a really easy life . they have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . they ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . __eou__ i think they must have horrible lives . all the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . they must get sick of it . __eou__ i bet they love it really . sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ i think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . they only want it for their films . __eou__ no way ! they want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! they have such an easy life . they don ’ t even pay for drin __eou__ show biz stars have plenty of expenses . that ’ s why they need so much money . they need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . i bet most show biz stars would prefer to wea __eou__ i don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . they ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . __eou__ i think you should give them some credit . they ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . they even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves __eou__ come on ! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves .
guess what ? i've got great news ! __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ well , you know how i've been working at the economist as a proof-reader , right ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ well , the editor-in-chief heard that i had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if i was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . __eou__ really ? that's fantastic ! will you get a chance to do any writing ? __eou__ she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that i could be in charge of the column until she came back . __eou__ wow ! that's really great news . how often does the magazine come out ? __eou__ it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . __eou__ are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? __eou__ yes , but i'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! __eou__ do you have any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine ? __eou__ i don't have any with me , but i think i could manage to bring a free copy home for you . __eou__ i'm really looking forward to reading your column . __eou__ me , too . do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? __eou__ sure , where would you like to go ? __eou__ perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .
i would like to watch the oscars on tv tonight . how about you ? __eou__ yes , i ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . __eou__ i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . __eou__ sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ? __eou__ i ‘ m really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . __eou__ you ’ re right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what ’ s you favourite award category ? __eou__ you might think this strange , but i like the category for best foreign language film . __eou__ it ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress .
are you interested in history ? __eou__ yes , i am . i enjoyed studying it at school , though i had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . __eou__ i love history , but i ’ ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . __eou__ i wish you had been my history teacher ! i might have got better marks ! __eou__ some people say that history repeats itself . __eou__ what does that mean ? the same events never happen twice , do they ? __eou__ the idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . __eou__ i see . i think i ’ d agree with that statement . people often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
london is such a historic city ! there ’ s history everywhere you look . there ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . he won the battle of __eou__ i ’ m looking forward to seeing westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like isaac newton , the great mathematician and winston churchill , the great wartime leader . __eou__ nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of boadicea . she fought the romans when they invaded britain . __eou__ women have often played an important role in british history . queen elizabeth i built a navy strong enough to fight off the spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , margaret thatcher transformed british __eou__ she was a very controversial leader . are we going to visit the famous tower of london later ? __eou__ there ’ s a lot to see there . perhaps we should go tomorrow . __eou__ i ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . i really want to see the crown jewels too . __eou__ i ’ ve seen them before . they ’ re quite incredible . if you want to see historical figures in london , there ’ s one place you have to go . __eou__ where ’ s that ? oh , i know ! madame tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . __eou__ there you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . __eou__ sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !
are you an art aficionado ? __eou__ not really . i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . i hardly know anything about art or sculpture . you are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? __eou__ i love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . __eou__ i never understand the meaning of those painting . they are too abstract for me . i didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . __eou__ art isn ’ t for everyone . i ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . it ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . __eou__ i like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or greece . what time are you thinking of going ? i ’ d love to go with you . __eou__ i thought i ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . does that sound ok to you ? bus 51 goes directly there . __eou__ that sounds fine . what time shall we meet at the bus stop ? __eou__ let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits .
the art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . he says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . __eou__ really ? i thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . what did you think of it ? __eou__ i liked it . i didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . __eou__ i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . he doesn ’ t seem to like anything . which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? __eou__ i like landscapes and still life . you prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , i do . i like painters who use rather than watercolors . the colors appear richer . what do you think ? __eou__ i agree . i prefer oils too . i collect landscapes , but i only have a small collection . you have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes . good artwork is very expensive nowadays . when i was in china , i bought some calligraphy by famous artists . you should come and see it sometime . __eou__ that would be nice . can you read the characters ? __eou__ i know what the characters on the paintings mean . i think chinese characters look very artistic . it ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . __eou__ i think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts .
how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ i've never really thought about it before . i guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ i guess so . i usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . how about you ? __eou__ i actually try to avoid name-brand items . i can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! __eou__ i know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , i think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . __eou__ i think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but i don't think it always makes sense . __eou__ do you have a brand preference for anything ? __eou__ i do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but i don't for higher-end items . __eou__ what do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? __eou__ it's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it . __eou__ i think it's a brilliant advert ! it really grabs my attention ! __eou__ to each their own !
do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? __eou__ not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ? __eou__ sure . what movies were you thinking about going to ? __eou__ have you heard of hot fuzz ? __eou__ yes . isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed shaun of the dead ? __eou__ that's the one . it's an actioncomedy . what do you think ? __eou__ to be honest , i didn't really like shaun of the dead . besides , i like movies with a happy ending best . __eou__ what do you have in mind ? __eou__ i was thinking of seeing you , me and dupree . it's a typical hollywood blockbuster . __eou__ isn't that the chick flick with kate hudson and owen wilson ? __eou__ yeah , i suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? __eou__ not really . do you like biographical / drama films ? __eou__ it depends on who the film is about . which movie did you have in mind ? __eou__ anne hathaway is in a new movie called becoming jane which is based on a true story about jane austen . __eou__ that sounds fantastic ! what time is it playing ? __eou__ it's on at 8 pm at the phoenix theatres . i have a membership there , so i can book the tickets ahead of time . __eou__ great . shall i meet you there around 7 forty-five tomorrow night ? __eou__ sounds good . i'll see you then !
so , have you seen all three the lord of the rings movies ? __eou__ yes , but i didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__ that's the return of the king , right ? __eou__ yeah . even though the customs were brilliant , i didn't think it was as good as the first two . what did you think ? __eou__ i thought the special effects were amazing , but i got a bit confused . the plot was too complicated for me . __eou__ did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__ no . did you ? __eou__ yes , i've read them many times . i think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__ yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__ i also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__ most movies are . another problem for me was the film was dubbed in german with english subtitles . __eou__ that happens a lot in non-english speaking countries . __eou__ i heard that the return of the king was nominated for 11 oscars . __eou__ actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 oscars , too !
hi , come on in . can i take your coat ? __eou__ sure , thanks . i brought you a bottle of wine as well . __eou__ you're the first guest to arrive . i'll just put your coat away and then i'll get you something to drink . __eou__ should i take my shoes off ? __eou__ whatever you prefer . __eou__ this is a very nice place . how long have you been living here now ? __eou__ just over three weeks . would you like a drink ? __eou__ sure , what do you have ? __eou__ i've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . __eou__ i'll have a glass of red wine please . __eou__ one glass of red wine coming up ! __eou__ so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? __eou__ there's just going to be 6 of us tonight . __eou__ oh , i thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? __eou__ marcia and paul called to cancel at the last moment . paul was running late and marcia wasn't feeling well . __eou__ that's too bad.they ' re such good company . __eou__ i think there's someone at the door . excuse me while i go and get that .
which language do you speak ? __eou__ well , i studied french at school , but i ’ ve forgotten most of it . i learnt some russian while i was studying there and now i study spanish in evening classes . do you speak japanese at home with your pa __eou__ yes , i do . i ’ m learning chinese now on the internet . __eou__ how do you find studying a language on the internet ? __eou__ it ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . __eou__ i bet you find the character difficult to write ! __eou__ actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both chinese and japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . __eou__ so , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? __eou__ yes . how are the spanish classes going ? __eou__ in a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning chinese . some spanish words are very similar to english ones . but i need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself .
let ’ s play a game ! __eou__ ok ! how about scrabble ? __eou__ no , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! __eou__ ok ! __eou__ let ’ s see . he has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! __eou__ our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! __eou__ aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok , my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh , he is also bald ! __eou__ your future husband ! __eou__ not funny .
those are today ’ s top stories . now let ’ s go to john for the weather . john , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? __eou__ i ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , mary . there is a storm system moving through the east coast . it will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve __eou__ that ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! will it rain on saturday ? __eou__ unfortunately , yes . it will be clear early saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . there is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the sout __eou__ that certainly sounds like a dreary saturday . __eou__ it gets better on sunday , though . the storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . it will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . the west coast will be experiencing some
is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? __eou__ yep . the steaks and chicken are marinated and i also bought hamburger buns . __eou__ we should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs . __eou__ yeah , good idea.we can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . i also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . __eou__ great ! i asked grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . __eou__ this is gonna be a great barbecue !
hey nick , what are you up to ? __eou__ not much , just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ? __eou__ seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don ’ t know man . __eou__ yeah , it will be fun ! i have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you __eou__ yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower ! __eou__ whoa , take it easy there rambo . don ’ t get carried away . these weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be __eou__ wow , i didn ’ t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! __eou__ the reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ? __eou__ let ’ s do it !
oh , man . i had the best supper last night . my wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! __eou__ i love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! mmm ! mmm ! it ’ s almost lunchtime . i would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! __eou__ well , you can keep the vegetables , i ’ ll take the meat . the stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... __eou__ what ? you call that a stir fry ? more meat than vegetables ? that ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a chinese stir fry . what a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! what you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap !
those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with mike sanderson . __eou__ thank you , bob ! this past week has been the beginning of armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . in switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the alps . fortunately , no one was injured . due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the us midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . moving to to latin american , ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . in chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the richter scale struck the southern region . losses are reported to be in the billions . authorities have not yet released an official statement . __eou__ not a great week for the world ! any good news ? __eou__ i ’ m afraid not , bob . one of the major volcanoes in mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . meanwhile , mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit central america , affecting honduras , guatemala and panama . that ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . back to you bob .
i ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . __eou__ sure ! how about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? __eou__ nah ! let ’ s go get a burger and fries . __eou__ all you ever do is have unhealthy fast food pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! you have to start eating better ! __eou__ what are you talking about ? i have salads some times . __eou__ yeah right ! i ’ m serious ! you should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . you drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! it ’ s really not healthy ! __eou__ fine ! i ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . are you happy now ? __eou__ it ’ s a start , but i ’ ll be happy when i see you stick to your promise !
did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? __eou__ what ? why do we have to do that ? __eou__ well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . __eou__ i see . that ’ s convenient ! i never understood things like this , such as gmt . i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! __eou__ that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ? well , then we were in china standard time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of greenwich ! __eou__ that ’ s why it was so weird traveling from beijing to la ! because of the huge time difference , even though we left beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in la the same day at noon ! it ’ s like we went back in time !
hey lydia , what are you reading ? __eou__ i ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! my outlook is very positive . it says that i should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that i will have a passionate summer fling ! __eou__ what are you talking about ? let me see that ... what are horoscopes ? __eou__ it ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . you have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . i was born on april 15th , so i ’ m an aries . when were you born ? __eou__ january 5th . __eou__ let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a capricorn . it says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! __eou__ that ’ s bogus . i don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . this zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . __eou__ no , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . see ? it says that an aries is energetic and loves to socialize . __eou__ well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . what does it say about me ? __eou__ a capricorn is serious-minded and practical . she likes to do things in conventional ways . that sounds just like you !
what are you doing ? __eou__ what am i doing ? what am i doing ? don ’ t you know what day it is ? __eou__ mumm . no . __eou__ it ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . __eou__ what ? __eou__ the world cup ! the first match is today ! it ’ s mexico vs . south africa ! it ’ s going to be a really good match ! both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . i think that south africa __eou__ i have no idea what you ’ re talking about . the only sporting event we watch at home is the super bowl . __eou__ this is bigger than the super bowl , man ! teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . they first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g __eou__ sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . __eou__ are you kidding ? over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the world cup ! it ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec __eou__ all i know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . it seems like a sissy sport to me ! __eou__ whatever , i ’ m going to go watch the opening match .
now that it ’ s the new year , i ’ ve decided to turn over a new leaf . __eou__ yeah ? you finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? __eou__ you got it ! i have a new job , i ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! this is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way i live my life . __eou__ so what are you going to do ? take up an art class or something ? __eou__ well , first of all , i ’ ve decided to stop smoking . it ’ s not that i ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that i ’ ve been smoking since i was sixteen , and i think it ’ s time to stop . __eou__ i ’ m with you on that one . anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? __eou__ one last thing , i ’ ve decided to come out of the closet . __eou__ it ’ s about time !
hey . why did you take that money ? you are such a cheater ! i should send you to jail ! __eou__ i am not cheating . when you pass go , you collect $ 200 , everyone knows that ! __eou__ well you can ’ t just take the money . you have to ask the bank for money . and i ’ m the banker . __eou__ banker ? __eou__ yes ... __eou__ can i have my $ 200 please ? __eou__ sure . here you are , $ 200 , thank you , please come again ! now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice .

oh , george , what a beautiful day it is today ! the sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! what a perfect day to be at the beach ! the kids are going to have so much fun ! a __eou__ it does seem like the perfect day ! i ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! this looks like the perfect spot ! ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and i set up ca __eou__ there we go . can you help me with the umbrella ? perfect . __eou__ ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a frisbee , a pail and a shovel . i want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . don ’ t stray too far . wait ! leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes __eou__ and stay in the shallow area . i don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! it ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . __eou__ you ’ re back already ? the water was too cold , huh ? i ’ ll tell you a secret . do you see that small pool of water over there ? it ’ ll be warmer in there . go see if you can find some seashells or catch some __eou__ what is that ? a jellyfish ? jeremy , put that down right now ! it could sting you ! __eou__ ah ! not on me ! ow !
thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! i ’ ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! let ’ s get started ! __eou__ ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! __eou__ oh look ! what a great little bib for the baby ! this will definitely come in handy ! oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! that ’ s so great ! thank you ! __eou__ this next one is from betty . __eou__ a highchair and car seat ! wow betty , thank you so much ! i really appreciate it ! __eou__ one more from carla . __eou__ a playpen and crib ! thanks carla ! this is just what i needed ! __eou__ ok , that ’ s all of them.no more gifts . now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? __eou__ umm . i think my water just broke ! get me to a hospital !
i've come to say goodbye . __eou__ when do you leave ? __eou__ i'm catching the eleven o'clock train . __eou__ take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . __eou__ goodbye . hope to see you again next year .
listen , karen , i need your help . i don't know anyone here yet . __eou__ i'm glad to help you . what's wrong ? __eou__ my mother-in-law just went into the hospital in l.a.hank and i will be flying there tonight . __eou__ i'm sorry to hear it . what's wrong with her ? __eou__ doctors aren't sure yet.but the real problem is suzy . she has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . but we don't know who can stay with her . __eou__ you need a babysitter . __eou__ yes , i'd ask jill , the girl i've had before , but i need someone overnight.maybe even for two nights . __eou__ i could have suzy stay at my place . __eou__ i don't want to do that to you , karen . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ your own kids would get suzy's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i don't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days . __eou__ i know who we can ask . there is a girl i know , sara ralston.she is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . i know her from my church , and i trust her completely . __eou__ i'd like to talk with her.this is short notice , i know . but hank and i are leaving tonight . __eou__ i'll get you her number . i hope she can do it . she is very responsible . __eou__ i'm glad you know someone . i knew you would be the best person to ask about this . i don't want to insult jill or her mother . i think jill maybe could do it.but i'd rather have someone a little older . __eou__ i'll go home and get sara's number . i'll call her first myself . __eou__ great . then call me and let me know if she's free .
what are we going to do ? i can't get the car out of this ditch . i'm stuck ! __eou__ i'm worried , tom . i haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__ i know . this is terrible . what can we do ? this snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ i told you we should have stayed in town today.the weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ i wanted to show you the cabin . we only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ well , now we're stuck . what can we do ? __eou__ i don't know . __eou__ i've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ we're stranded here , tom . we may be here a long time.we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ i have plenty of gas . __eou__ yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.we can't just let the car run and run.if we do , it will die soon . then we'll freeze . __eou__ so what can we do ? __eou__ turn the lights off.then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.that will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ alright . that's a good idea . __eou__ i wish we hadn't come up here . now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ days ? __eou__ yes , it happens.that is what happens in big snowstorms . people get stranded for days . __eou__ oh , my god ! it's good we have food . __eou__ probably we'll survive.but turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . then we'll turn it on again . __eou__ okay , i'll follow your advice .
hi . what's up ? __eou__ nothing much . what's new with you ? __eou__ not too much . i've been pretty busy . __eou__ me too . seems like all i do is eat and sleep . __eou__ gotta go . call me tonight . __eou__ okay . check you later .
good morning golf aficionados ! my name is rick fields , and you guessed it , i am here with my main man , bob copeland . __eou__ thank you , rick ! as you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful pebble beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__ whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! let ’ s go to the course and see how tiger woods is doing . __eou__ all right , we are here at the eighth hole . it ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . although , i did see jack nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! __eou__ tiger woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as jack . tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__ oh no ! not a good swing at all ! it ’ s definitely not his day today . on the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . he will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__ it seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . he is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__ oh no ! a bear ! run , tiger , run ! somebody call animal control !
there is a tornado warning on . my mother just told me she heard it on the radio . __eou__ what is a tornado warning ? __eou__ it means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . __eou__ really ? in new berlin ? __eou__ no . not necessarily in town . but in southern wisconsin somewhere . a tornado has been spotted . they have two stages here.this is what is called a " tornado watch . " that means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . __eou__ i understand . they think a tornado might come . __eou__ yes . people should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.so it's called a " watch . " __eou__ and the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . __eou__ yes . if a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . so if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . __eou__ it's scary . __eou__ well . tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.if we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . __eou__ what do you mean " a loud train " ? __eou__ that is what tornadoes sound like . they sound like trains . they're very loud . __eou__ but if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? __eou__ maybe . it depends on the tornado.some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.that is very fast . others aren't so fast . __eou__ have you seen a lot of them ? __eou__ i've only seen one in my life . i was looking out the window . it was around two miles away . it was very interesting to watch.but it was heading toward my friend's house . so i quickly called them on the phone . __eou__ did it hit their house ? __eou__ no , it didn't . but they are glad i called them . __eou__ what were they doing when you called ? __eou__ they were all sitting in the living room watching tv.they had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.if it had hit them , they could have all been killed . __eou__ that's terrible . do many people die in tornadoes ? __eou__ not so many really . but a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes .
and so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . thank you very much for your time . __eou__ hey , that was quite the presentation ! honestly , i was completely blown away by your strategy outline . i've gotta say , alex , you really wowed me today . __eou__ aw , come on , it was nothing . i'm just doing my job . __eou__ no , i think you deserve some recognition here ; i mean , if i look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . __eou__ well , kristin did give me a hand with the slides.she ' s a real wiz on powerpoint . __eou__ and i saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . i really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . __eou__ yeah , well , that was some good advice . you made some really good points . __eou__ well , i just wanted to say well done . really you did a great job .
ok , that ’ s fine . bye . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ that ’ s it , my lease is up . i have to move . __eou__ what ? why ? can ’ t you renew it ? __eou__ the owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot __eou__ well , i can help you pack . we should start looking for a new place for you asap . __eou__ i think i might move in with my parents for a couple of months until i can find something . you know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . i ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . __eou__ well , let me know if there ’ s anything i can do to help out . __eou__ actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? __eou__ hehe .. sure
hey there , you look a little lost . are you new here ? __eou__ yeah how ’ d you know ? __eou__ you can always spot the newbies . i can give you a few pointers if you want . were you trying to use this machine here ? __eou__ yeah ! i just started my training today and i ’ m not really sure where to begin . __eou__ it ’ s ok , i know how it is . this machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? __eou__ well , i don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! i just want a good physique with weights and carpio . __eou__ in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . __eou__ got it ! wow is that the weight you are lifting ? my goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! __eou__ it ’ s not that much . just watch ... i ’ m ok ...
i ’ m forming a music band . __eou__ do you already know how to play an instrument ? __eou__ uh ... yeah ! i ’ ve told you a thousand times that i ’ m learning to play the drums . now that i know how to play well , i would like to form a rock band . __eou__ aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? __eou__ we have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . you told me that you had some musical talent , right ? __eou__ yes , i ’ m a singer . __eou__ perfect . so you can audition this weekend here at my house . __eou__ great ! wait here ? you don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! by the way where do you keep them or practice ?
this is the good life ! we have it good don ’ t you think ? __eou__ yeah of course ! although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ well , sometimes i think of how things could have turned out if i had done things a little differently . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ like for example , if i hadn ’ t studied architecture , i would have become an artist like i wanted to . __eou__ i see . yeah now that i think of it , i wouldn ’ t have gotten married if i hadn ’ t moved to this town and met sally . __eou__ you see ! everything happens for a reason ! we wouldn ’ t even have met if i hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! __eou__ well , i have no regrets ! __eou__ i ’ ll drink to that !
mark . where have you been ? i ’ ve been calling you all morning . __eou__ i ’ ve been playing computer games . __eou__ what ? so you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? what game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? what are you playing ? __eou__ it ’ s called counter strike.it ’ s a first person shooter game.it ’ s awesome.it ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . __eou__ you ’ ve been wasting your time on this ? i can ’ t believe it ! it doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! __eou__ my laptop is on my bed . if you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . __eou__ fine ! __eou__ damp it ! how are you killing me with a single shot ? it ’ s not fair ! i don ’ t want to play anymore ! let ’ s go get something to eat . __eou__ can you bring me something ? i am totally hooked on this game !
you ’ ll never guess what ! my friends julie and alex are getting married ! __eou__ wow that ’ s great news ! they ’ re a great couple ! __eou__ i know ! anyways i just talked to alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party it ’ s gonna be so much fun ! all the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . __eou__ you aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? i don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . __eou__ aw come on ! it ’ s just some innocent fun ! you know how these things are ! we are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . nothing too over the top . __eou__ well , i don ’ t know . __eou__ come on ! if one of your friends was getting married i wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! __eou__ good , because my friend wendy is getting married and i ’ m organizing her party ! __eou__ what !
okay , next question . if eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? __eou__ duh ! i would say yes ! eric is the most popular kid in school ! okay , my turn . what would you do if you won the lottery ? __eou__ let ’ s see ... if i won the lottery , i would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . __eou__ if you buy me a ticket i will go with you for sure ! __eou__ my dad will freak out if i even mention a trip like that ! __eou__ alright this is a good one . what would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? __eou__ if i told her that , she would faint and have me committed !
you should have seen the t . v . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ do you really believe in that ? if they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ i understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . if so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ you can ’ t compare apples and oranges . i believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . i believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ well , you are right on that point . this is the reason that i don ’ t buy leather and i try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ as long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine .
bobby ! come here , look what i got you ! __eou__ what is that ? __eou__ a chess board ! daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__ cool ! __eou__ ok , each player gets 16 pieces . you can be the white ones and i ’ ll play with the black pieces . now in the front , you set up the pawns . those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . when you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__ what about all these other pieces ? __eou__ see this one that looks like a tower ? it ’ s called the rook . the one with the tall hat is called the bishop . see this little horsey ? this is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . __eou__ and these two ? they are husband and wife ? __eou__ that ’ s right ! that ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . if the other player captures your king , he will say check mate and the game is over ! doesn ’ t this sound fun ? __eou__ nah ! this is boring ! i ’ m gonna go play killer zombies on my playstation !
hey man ! how ’ s it hanging ? __eou__ hey man ! everything is just groovy baby ! __eou__ did you go to the roller rink on saturday ? i heard it was far out , man ! __eou__ i wanted to , but i ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! i was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . __eou__ right on , right on ! well , jim went to the rink with sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! he was low on bread , but sherry paid for everything . __eou__ gravy ! jim is such a jive turkey man . he is always hitting me up for cash . anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? __eou__ yeah man , i ’ m starving !
can we talk ? __eou__ sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ you know what i mean . __eou__ yeah . i know . __eou__ i want to know where this relationship is going . i ’ m in love with you and i need to know ... __eou__ you know , i think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ i ’ m awesome . well , i guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . __eou__ honey ... __eou__ look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ ve had our laughs , but i don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... __eou__ baby , i love you so much . __eou__ you do ? __eou__ i love you . and i think you ’ re awesome . __eou__ oh , i love you too ! __eou__ come on . put the gun down . __eou__ oh baby , i ’ m so sorry .
welcome back movie lovers to another premier movie review . my name is richard clarke and i am joined today by the very erudite davidwatson . __eou__ thank you dick . today we are going to talk about the movie lion king . tell me dave , what is your impression of this film ? __eou__ well , i think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.the musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __eou__ i think otherwise . even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by elton john were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . and i would dare to say , it was too predictable . __eou__ predictable ! how ! come on dick , it ’ s a g-rated movie ! it ’ s for the kids ! it ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__ well , that ’ s just it . it did have some very dramatic and intense scenes for example when mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of scar . even so , the film is linear . mufasal dies , simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . it ’ s just too cliche . __eou__ how can it be cliche ? it ’ s a fable ! it ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! the movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . __eou__ you have always been so soft , dave ! __eou__ open your heart dick . don ’ t shut us out . __eou__ anyway ... that ’ s all for today folks ! join us next time as we talk about & quot , how to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , i ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one dave !

it ’ s a beautiful day here in new zealand at the men ’ s volleyball world championship . my name is rick fields and i ’ m joined by the man with the plan , bob copeland . __eou__ thank you , rick . we ’ ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , brazil and china , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__ the ref signals the start of the game and here we go . ribero serves and china quickly receives the ball . chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by chen ! __eou__ xu spikes it ! wow , what a great hit ! the brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! __eou__ it ’ s china ’ s service now . what a superb jump serve by li , oh , and we have a let serve . the ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__ brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break .

excuse me . can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? __eou__ of course . are you a new member here ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ welcome . my name is johnson . __eou__ nice to meet you . __eou__ do you have any experience using weights ? __eou__ no , i don't . so i need some help . __eou__ well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.you must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . __eou__ yes , i know that.derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.so i'm ready , i think . i can start using the machines . __eou__ alright . great . then we must get a card for you . __eou__ what do you mean--a membership card ? i already have one . __eou__ no . not that . i mean a training card.the card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.here , let me show you . __eou__ i'm ready . __eou__ now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.so , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.and you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . __eou__ i see . so this card helps me to keep track of my progress . __eou__ yes . and it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.today , i will go through the machines with you one by one . i will show you how to use them.and we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . __eou__ alright . great . __eou__ so you write your name and member number at the top of the card.and then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . __eou__ great . why don't we start on the machines ? __eou__ are you alright ? can you do more ? __eou__ i'm sorry . i know there are still seven machines . but i'm exhausted . __eou__ that's okay . don't worry.it ' s important not to push yourself . especially not at the beginning . __eou__ what can i do though ? i don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . __eou__ we can just go through them next time . it's no problem . really.the most important thing is to know your limits.so if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . right ? __eou__ yes . i suppose it's best to stop .
i think i'm going to go home . __eou__ why ? we just got here . __eou__ i know , but it's 12 __eou__ 12 __eou__ three or four o'clock ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ i never stay out that late . that's too late . __eou__ but why is it too late ? it's saturday night.you have nothing to do tomorrow . why not stay out and drink with us ? __eou__ were you so wild when you were still in taipei , sharon ? __eou__ yes , i was . and i like living here.people know how to party here . in taipei , some people know how to party.but here , everyone does . __eou__ what is that they're doing on the couch ? __eou__ they're smoking pot . don't worry about it . __eou__ pot ? isn't that marijuana ? __eou__ yes , it is . __eou__ but , sharon , that's illegal ! the police could come , and we could go to jail . __eou__ don't worry about it . it is true that pot is illegal in america.but the laws aren't as strict as in taiwan.if people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . they just have to pay a fine . __eou__ really ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ i didn't know you had such wild friends . do you smoke marijuana too ? __eou__ i tried it a couple times . but i don't like it . i like alcohol better.don ' t worry about them , though . if you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . __eou__ i don't want to . __eou__ that's alright . but you really should have another drink.people will probably start dancing soon . __eou__ i don't know if i can drink more . i already had two drinks . __eou__ you had two drinks at nine o'clock . c'mon , ann , you are in an american university now ! you have to learn how to drink . __eou__ i thought a university was for studying . __eou__ it is . we study hard all week.and then , on the weekend , we party hard . that's the best way to live . __eou__ alright . i'll have another drink .
i'm going over to the gym . i want to do some running . __eou__ why don't you run outside ? __eou__ are you kidding ? do you know how cold it is today ? __eou__ yeah , i suppose . i guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather . __eou__ no , it's not . not at all . i'd probably freeze my lungs . __eou__ wait for me a minute . i'll go over to the gym too . __eou__ you ? __eou__ yes , why not ? just let me get my gym clothes together . __eou__ i didn't know you could exercise . __eou__ what do you mean by that ? everyone can exercise ! __eou__ yeah , i know . but you ? i always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth . __eou__ no , not at all . i was on the swimming team in high school.and i'd like to do some weight training . they have decent equipment at that gym . __eou__ you're going to lift weights ? hah ! __eou__ are you laughing at me ? __eou__ i'm sorry . i just can't imagine you lifting weights . __eou__ maybe not . but i want to start . i need to get in shape . i feel these past couple months that my energy is low . __eou__ it's true . if a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.that ' s why i keep running . even in the winter . __eou__ so i need to do something too . __eou__ but lifting weights isn't the best thing.you should do some kind of aerobic exercise . __eou__ i know . but i want to start today with a little weight lifting.then i'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day i'm going to go swim laps in the pool . how does that sound ? __eou__ it sounds like a good plan to me . i'm still ... i mean ... __eou__ what ? __eou__ i'm still just surprised you really want to do it.it doesn't seem to go with your character .
i am kind of nervous . __eou__ nervous ? why ? __eou__ i don't know . i never went to a church before . i was not raised as a christian , so i don't know what to do . __eou__ don't worry . you don't have to do anything.all you have to do is listen . you will enjoy it . __eou__ maybe . i know i agreed to go with you , but now i don't feel right about it . __eou__ listen , ryan.catholics welcome people who aren't catholics to visit the church.you don't have to pretend to be catholic . it's okay if you just come to listen . __eou__ really ? __eou__ yes . we are kind and welcoming people.it is not a secret society or something like that . __eou__ alright . but will we sing ? __eou__ yes , but you don't even have to sing . if you want to sing along , you can . __eou__ i don't know the words . __eou__ there is a songbook . all the words are in the songbook.many people have to read the words . __eou__ and will i go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? __eou__ no . that is something only true catholics do.so if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.but you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the eucharist . __eou__ eu-char-ist ? what is that ? __eou__ that is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.the catholics call it the eucharist . __eou__ it doesn't sound like an english word . __eou__ it's not . it's an ancient greek word . it means gratitude . __eou__ alright . well , i feel more comfortable now.now i understand i am welcome as a visitor . __eou__ of course you are . i wouldn't ask you otherwise .
karen , do you have a minute ? i'd like to ask you about something . __eou__ sure . what is it ? __eou__ i think you can give me some advice.you have worked here longer , and i just want to know what you think . __eou__ i'm glad to help you . but what is it you want to ask about ? __eou__ i am worried about the meeting this morning . __eou__ why ? i think the meeting went well . __eou__ really ? __eou__ yes . but what are you worried about ? __eou__ i'm afraid i was too rude . __eou__ rude ? you weren't rude at all , annie . why do you think you were rude ? __eou__ well , i maybe talked to mr . drummond too directly . i thought i maybe said too much . i don't want him to be angry . __eou__ i understand . but really you weren't rude at all.you said what you thought . i think he appreciates that . __eou__ really ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ but i am new here , and i'm not sure he is used to that . __eou__ you mean because you are a woman ? __eou__ yes . and he is the president of the company . __eou__ listen , annie . you shouldn't worry about mr . drummond.he is a very good man to work for . he is not sexist at all.he appreciates people for their ideas.and he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . __eou__ i am very happy to hear that , karen.it ' s good to know i'm working in such a company . __eou__ i agree with you on that , annie . i've worked for derek drummond for nine years now . i feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . i would never change jobs . __eou__ good . thank you for telling me this . __eou__ any time . if you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.this is a company that appreciates initiative .
excuse me . is anyone in that seat next to you ? __eou__ no , i don't think so . __eou__ do you mind if i put my jacket there ? __eou__ no . it's no problem.are you american ? __eou__ yes . and you ? __eou__ no . i'm from taiwan . can't you see ? __eou__ well , there are many chinese americans , you know.and your english is very good . you sound like an american . __eou__ i don't think so . you are flattering me . __eou__ no , really . i can only hear a little accent . __eou__ are you flying home ? __eou__ well , yes . actually , i'm going back to visit . __eou__ you were visiting taiwan ? __eou__ no , i'm going back to america to visit . i'm from america , but i don't live there now . i live in taichung . __eou__ really ! you live in taiwan ! __eou__ yes . why not ? __eou__ may i ask what your job is in taiwan ? __eou__ sure . i teach history in a university . have you heard of dong-hai university ? __eou__ of course . it's a good school . how long have you lived in taichung ? __eou__ i have lived in taichung for two years now.so this is the second time i am going back to states . i go back once a year to visit my family . __eou__ it must be strange for you to live in taiwan . __eou__ no , it isn't strange at all.many people from taiwan move to america too , you know.do you think it is strange for them ? __eou__ no . well , i don't know.but taiwan is so crowded . don't you miss life in america ?
so it looks like we start selling in the u . s . next year . __eou__ did mr . lin put you in charge of marketing ? __eou__ he's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an american.but even if he hires an american , i'll probably be transferred to our american office . __eou__ where will it be ? __eou__ we aren't sure yet . maybe l . a . i think l . a . would be the best idea . __eou__ is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the u . s . ? __eou__ yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.now we have the right to sell in america at a much lower tariff.it ' s going to be good . we can compete more directly with them . __eou__ great . __eou__ our computers have a high level of quality now.we can demonstrate it . and our prices will be good.so i think it will really be worthwhile . __eou__ you seem excited about it . __eou__ well , you know i studied marketing in america.so maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . i'd love to be part of the team . __eou__ do you honestly think we can compete though ? all the computer giants are there . __eou__ yes , i do . i think we can compete . i think we can make a name for ourselves.it will be hard at first . but if we develop a good advertising campaign , i think we can break into the market . __eou__ the company will have to choose a good advertising firm.and then there's the problem of quality.how do we convince american buyers that our quality is good ? __eou__ it takes some time.because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.name recognition is crucial . __eou__ well , i hope it all works out , john . i think if you're part of the team , things will go well.but you know we'd all miss you here . so i won't say i'm happy to think that you're leaving . __eou__ that's very nice of you to say.but if we set up an office there in the states , maybe you could try to become part of it . __eou__ me ? no way . i'm dedicated to the company , but i'm not going to leave taiwan . i'm happy here .
bye , mom ! __eou__ wait , jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . put a hat on ! __eou__ ok . bye ! __eou__ no , wait , you will be too cold without mittens . __eou__ alright . see ya ! __eou__ hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . wear this scarf . __eou__ ok , see you after school ... __eou__ oh ... and ear muffs ! put these on ... here we go . __eou__ mom ? __eou__ yes , honey ... __eou__ i ... i can ’ t breathe .
there are some things i miss . but i love chinese food.and i think the people in taiwan are really hospitable.besides , i grew up in los angeles , so i'm used to living in crowded places.why are you going to america ? __eou__ i'm going to new york to visit my sister . she is in art school . i've never been to new york before . i'm kind of scared . __eou__ why ? __eou__ well , i know a lot of people have guns there . i think maybe it isn't too safe . __eou__ don't worry about it.your sister lives there . she probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.it ' s true there are some dangerous places in big american cities.but if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . __eou__ yes , i'm not really scared . maybe only a little . __eou__ don't believe what you see on tv . you will have a good time in new york.what things do you want to see ? __eou__ i want to see the museums , and i want to shop a lot . __eou__ the museums are excellent . and the shopping ! well ! i'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there . __eou__ hmm . i hope not .
isn ’ t this great ? i always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! __eou__ this is very beautiful . though i have to confess , i don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! __eou__ that ’ s fine ! don ’ t worry about it ! __eou__ what was that ? __eou__ relax , it was just a goat ! __eou__ and that ? __eou__ it ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . we can milk them later . __eou__ what was that ? __eou__ honey , seriously , it ’ s just a sheep . relax ! __eou__ relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . __eou__ you know what ? i don ’ t think i can hack it here out in the countryside . i ’ m going back to the city !
did you read this ? it says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . __eou__ why would that be funny ? __eou__ well , think about it . we are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . __eou__ why ? __eou__ we work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . __eou__ i don ’ t agree , but anyways , i think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . __eou__ what ’ s the point ? we always make a new year ’ s resolution and by february we will have forgotten about it . it ’ s pointless . __eou__ well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . __eou__ what about you ? your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . __eou__ well , i would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! __eou__ yeah , yeah , whatever .
man , i ’ m freaking out ! you gotta help me ! __eou__ whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! what ’ s going on ? __eou__ i can ’ t go through with this ! i just can ’ t ! i ’ m not ready for marriage ! what was i thinking ? i ’ m only thirty five years old ! i ’ ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! i can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__ what are you talking about ? it wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__ i know . i know ! __eou__ let ’ s think this through . first of all , you cannot leave amy at the altar . not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? second of all , you are just getting cold feet . you know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! __eou__ you ’ re right . i ’ m being crazy ! ok , i ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__ great ! phew ! that was a close one ! you had me going there for a minute i thought i was gonna have to slap some sense into you .
tom ! how are you ? we missed you at the party last night . are you ok ? __eou__ i don ’ t know . i didn ’ t really feel like going out . i guess i ’ m feeling a little homesick . __eou__ come on.we ’ ve been through this already ! look , i know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . __eou__ i was . it ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and i won ’ t be able to home because i can ’ t afford the airfare . i ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . __eou__ yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . when i first got here , i ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . i almost let it get to me , but then i started going out , keeping myself busy and before i knew it , i was used to to it . __eou__ i see what you mean , but i ’ m still bummed out . __eou__ ok . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . i hear that an awesome dj is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! __eou__ you know , i could really go for that . you don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? __eou__ not at all ! it be fun ! it will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... __eou__ great ! i must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture !
tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ? __eou__ what are you talking about ? where is your halloween spirit ? didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? __eou__ of course , i did , but when i was ten ! trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , i ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids ncp at night . __eou__ whatever , i ’ m going next door i heard mrs . robinson is giving out big bags of m & ms !
wow , american football is more exciting than i thought . __eou__ you ’ re in america now , my british friend . we just call it football . __eou__ oh , right . so , i can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ the giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ wow ! what a hit ! __eou__ yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ is he ok ? __eou__ it looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ i guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ the giants ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ well , here we go again . __eou__ what happened ? why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ the redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . we ’ re losing again .
wow ! i can ’ t believe i ’ m standing here ! __eou__ what are you so excited about ? __eou__ i ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! __eou__ what ’ s the big deal ? it ’ s just a picture of some woman . __eou__ i ’ ve seen it so many times in books , but i never imagined i ’ d get to see it in person . __eou__ there are tons of other paintings that i think are better . __eou__ maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? __eou__ no , how much is it worth ? __eou__ about 80 million dollars . __eou__ whoa .
here ’ s your hot dog and beer . what happened ? did i miss anything ? __eou__ yeah , cal ripen just hit a home run . __eou__ what ’ s the score ? __eou__ well it was 3 to 4 , but ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . __eou__ so baltimore is winning ? __eou__ right . __eou__ this is a really great place to watch a baseball game . __eou__ yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . __eou__ the fans are great here , too . not like in philadelphia . __eou__ it was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . __eou__ yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is america ’ s favorite pastime .
who are those guys ? __eou__ kobi bryant and shaquille o ’ neal , they are the los angeles lakers ’ star players . __eou__ oh . __eou__ wait a second . he shoots , he scores ! __eou__ all right ! __eou__ here comes jordan , though . __eou__ wow , michael jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . __eou__ yeah . he ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam , as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . __eou__ which team do you think will win ? __eou__ the lakers . jordan is the only good player washington has .
what ’ s the mountaineering club doing this weekend ? __eou__ we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river . __eou__ how hard is the climb ? __eou__ it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . __eou__ what did you do last week ? __eou__ we rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . it was very exciting . __eou__ wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i ’ m sorry i missed it . __eou__ well , you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb . __eou__ yeah , i will . see you then ! __eou__ o . k . see you .

we ’ ve been over this a thousand times . the data is irrefutable ! look , we ’ ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! __eou__ horowitz , i beg to differ . even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! you know as well as i do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . to draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading __eou__ that is preposterous ! __eou__ you are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! __eou__ i am not wrong ! the chicken came first ! __eou__ no ! the egg came first !
hello everyone ! i ’ m rick fields , and here with me is bob copeland . __eou__ howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! you know , rick , today is a key game between russia and canada . as you know , the winner will move on to the finals . __eou__ that ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . the ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! the russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! federal gets checked hard into the boards ! __eou__ maurice richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . he shoots ! wow what a save by the goalie ! __eou__ alright , the puck is back in play now . pavel bure is on a breakaway ! he is flying down the ice ! the defenders can ’ t keep up ! slap shot ! he scores . __eou__ what an amazing goal !
i never understand why these shops have so much liquor . __eou__ what do you mean ? it's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free . __eou__ but why ? why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? or shoes ? i just don't understand why it's always liquor . __eou__ well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it . __eou__ you mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? __eou__ yes , of course . didn't you know that ? __eou__ no , i didn't . how high is the tax ? __eou__ well , it is different in different countries.but it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . __eou__ why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? __eou__ liquor is considered a luxury item.and also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.so if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . __eou__ that's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? __eou__ of course . cigarettes are also taxed very heavily .
hectic . it's always hectic . but how was your windsurfing ? __eou__ i tried it for a half-hour.it was interesting , but ... well ... i couldn't really do it . __eou__ see ? i told you . it's very hard . __eou__ i couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail . i probably fell down fifty times . __eou__ fifty times ? __eou__ yes , it was really stupid . __eou__ and how much did it cost to rent it ? __eou__ it was fifty dollars for a half-hour . __eou__ well , that's not too bad then . __eou__ what do you mean ? it's expensive ! __eou__ yes , but you have to calculate a little.you paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.so you only spent one dollar per fall . that's cheap .
this place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? __eou__ yes . but i'm not used to eating american-style breakfast . __eou__ what are you planning to do today ? __eou__ i saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . i want to rent one . __eou__ have you done windsurfing before ? __eou__ no , but it looks fun . i always wanted to try it . __eou__ can you take a little advice from a friend ? __eou__ sure . what ? __eou__ don't waste your money . windsurfing is very hard . and it will be windy today.they will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.you will fall and fall and fall . __eou__ but i always wanted to try it . __eou__ yes , but it takes a long time to learn.you would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . __eou__ well , i will see . how was your day at the office ?
you are too picky . __eou__ no , i'm not.hey , look at that guy over there . __eou__ which guy ? __eou__ the guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . __eou__ i can't see him . where ? __eou__ right there . __eou__ oh , i see him now . wait ! that's ... __eou__ yes , it's mel gibson . __eou__ oh , wow ! it's really him ! who is that woman he's with ? __eou__ i don't know . why don't you go ask for his autograph ? __eou__ i can't do that . __eou__ why not ?
i'm not comfortable about this , sandy . i don't understand most of these games . __eou__ that's okay . i can explain a little . __eou__ i don't want to lose all my money . __eou__ don't worry . you can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . __eou__ i guess you're right . __eou__ of course i'm right . i already told you the rule for las vegas . remember ? __eou__ yes , i remember.you must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . __eou__ that's right . that's the best way to have control over yourself.you say to yourself . tonight i will gamble fifty dollars . only fifty dollars . no more.if you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . __eou__ i know it's true , sandy . but still some people lose control.they start to gamble , and they can't stop . __eou__ but i won't let you do that . i will watch you . __eou__ okay . __eou__ so how much do you want to gamble ? __eou__ maybe 500 dollars . __eou__ 500 dollars ! that's too much ! you just said you are afraid to lose your money.if you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? __eou__ i don't want people to think i'm stingy . __eou__ that is a bad attitude to have , karen ! if you think that way , las vegas will be really dangerous for you .
now i understand . but i don't smoke or drink.so what am i supposed to buy in here ? __eou__ you can buy some of these nice butterflies . __eou__ no , i'm sorry . i don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.it is kind of disgusting . __eou__ what ? you feel sorry for the butterflies ? __eou__ yes . i think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . it is a kind of destruction of nature . __eou__ well , i agree with you . i'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . i just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . __eou__ who knows ? hey , i like these jade bears here . __eou__ how much are they ? __eou__ this one is 2300 dollars.maybe i should buy it for my mother . what do you think ? __eou__ if you want . didn't you buy her a small vase already ? __eou__ yes , but she would like this a lot . she likes to collect little things like this . __eou__ alright . buy it then . i won't buy anything . well , maybe i'll buy some cognac . __eou__ maybe i could buy some cognac for my brother . he always drinks it . __eou__ let's go ask about it .
so how much should i gamble ? __eou__ why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ? __eou__ okay . one-hundred then . do you think i will lose it ? __eou__ i don't know . you have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.some games are all luck . with some , you need to be smart . __eou__ i want games that are all luck . __eou__ i knew you would say that ! then you should play the slot machines . __eou__ slot machines ? no , i don't want that ! that's too boring . i want a game with cards or dice . __eou__ so what do you want to play then ? __eou__ blackjack.we can play blackjack . and i will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars . __eou__ huh ? you are breaking our rule already ! and we didn't even start to play yet ! __eou__ oh , don't be so strict ! we are in las vegas . __eou__ yes , and if i stay with you , we will have to walk back home to new york.because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too !
... so , i said , let ’ s take a break.and since that night , i ’ ve been waiting for him to call , but i still haven ’ t heard from him . you don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? __eou__ come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! i ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine . __eou__ you think so ? oh , no ! how can he do this to me ? i ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! why else wouldn ’ t he call ? __eou__ but , you two are on a break . theoretically he can do whatever he likes . __eou__ he ’ s the love of my life ! i ’ ve really messed this up . __eou__ come on , hon . pull yourself together . it ’ s going to be alright . __eou__ but i ... i still love him ! and it ’ s all my fault ! i can ’ t believe how immature and selfish i was being . i mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . i ’ ve totally messed this up ! __eou__ you know what , veronica , i think you should make the first step . i ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... __eou__ no , this is not gonna happen ! i ... i ’ ve ruined everything ... __eou__ do you hear something ?
irene ! i heard you were on a date last night ! so , how how did it go ? i want all the juicy details ! __eou__ um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . he was ... amazing ! __eou__ okay , now you really have to fill me in . what ’ s he like ? __eou__ he ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... __eou__ he sounds hot ! what does he do for a living ? __eou__ you know what , this is the best part . david is a junior investment banker at fortune bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! __eou__ hold on a sec , his name is david ? __eou__ yeah ? __eou__ that ’ s my brother !
i ’ m so excited about chinese new year ! when do i get to visit grandma ? grandma makes the best dumplings in the world ! __eou__ ha ha , right . sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your grandma . __eou__ of course i miss grandma , too . i bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play mahjong ! hey , dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? we ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! i ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! __eou__ son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous ! __eou__ no , fireworks are awesome ! __eou__ whoa , don ’ t you remember ? last year when i set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ? __eou__ i was scared because ... because i saw a bug . that ’ s all . __eou__ ahahah ... really ? __eou__ oh , and i can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! dad , can i sit on your shoulders this time ? __eou__ hey , i offered last year ... __eou__ well , i ... anyways , i was just thinking of the red envelopes . i wanna make a list of all the things i ’ m gonna buy with my red envelope money ! i can ’ t wait ! i ’ m gonna have so much money ! mom , can i get a pen and a piece of paper ? i want a new transformer , no , two transformers ... the optimums prime , and ... maybe the wheeljack ? i ’ ll get a psp game , ahahah , and i ’ ll buy the entire class lunch at macdonald ’ s ...
has the game started yet ? __eou__ yeah , about 5 minutes ago . __eou__ who's winning ? __eou__ the bulls , of course ! __eou__ what ! that wasn't a foul ! c ’ mon , ref ! __eou__ don ’ t worry , shan always screws up free throws . __eou__ you were right ! he didn ’ t make the shot ! __eou__ that was a great shot ! a three pointer , yeah ! __eou__ did you see that ? he traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! __eou__ this ref needs glasses . hey ref , open your eyes ! i can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! __eou__ okay ... end of the first quarter ... alright , i ’ m gonna make a beer run .
i ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! i feel just awful about this whole thing . i wanna make it up to you . let me take you out to dinner tonight . my treat . __eou__ that sounds great ! i ’ d love to ! here is my address . pick me up at eight ? __eou__ perfect ! __eou__ thank you for such a lovely evening ! the food was amazing , and i had a great time . __eou__ me too.you look so beautiful tonight ! i wish this night would never end.there ’ s something i have to tell you ... __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ i woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but i was wrong . a twist of fate brought us together . i crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but i ’ m falling in love with you , veronica .
so , did i tell you about my new year ’ s resolution ? i ’ ve decided to go on a diet . __eou__ and you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? __eou__ exactly ! i ’ m going to cut out all that junk i eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . __eou__ i ’ ve heard this one before . __eou__ but this time i ’ m going to stick to it . i really mean it ! trust me , carol , i ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! __eou__ well , i guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . __eou__ thanks , honey , that was a great meal . i ’ m stuffed . do we have any chips left ?
i can ’ t believe that anthony is finally getting married ! __eou__ yeah well it ’ s about time ! he ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! __eou__ don ’ t be mean . look here come the bridesmaids ! their dresses look beautiful ! __eou__ who are those kids walking down the aisle ? __eou__ that ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . i ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.oh , they look so cute ! __eou__ i just hope the priest makes it quick . i ’ m starving . i hope the food ’ s good at the reception . __eou__ that ’ s all you ever think about , food ! oh , i think the bride ’ s coming now ! she looks gorgeous.wait , what ’ s she doing ? where ’ s she going ? __eou__ oh great ! does this mean that the reception is canceled ?
whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? watch out ! __eou__ hey , watch where you ’ re going ! __eou__ oh , no ! i ’ m so sorry ! are you all right ? __eou__ oh ... i don ’ t know . __eou__ i feel terrible , i really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . my tire , just exploded , and i lost control of my bike . really , it was an accident . please accept my apologies . __eou__ oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , i think i know you from somewhere . __eou__ yeah , i think we have met somewhere before . that ’ s right ! we met at aaron ’ s place last weekend ! what a coincidence ! but anyway , i ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and i should probably get going . i have a nine o ’ clock meeting . __eou__ ouch ! my ankle ! i think it ’ s broken ! you can ’ t just leave me like this ! are you calling an ambulance ? __eou__ nope , i ’ m canceling my appointment so that i can stay here with you .
what do you want to do tomorrow night ? __eou__ what--is tomorrow night something special ? __eou__ it's friday . we should go party . __eou__ i don't need to drink every weekend . i could be happy just staying home , you know . __eou__ okay . stay home sunday . but friday we should go out dancing . __eou__ do you feel like dancing ? __eou__ yes ? why not ? __eou__ alright.at least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . __eou__ they aren't alcoholic ! __eou__ no , maybe they're not . but they're close . __eou__ so where should we go ? __eou__ let's go to the latin club . i think they will have a brazilian band there this weekend . maybe it's friday night . __eou__ you always want to go to the latin club . i don't know those dance steps . i'd rather go to the new bar . __eou__ the new bar is all techno music on friday night.you really want to dance to that ? __eou__ it's not all techno music . it's not a special techno night . __eou__ no . but they play techno all the time . it drives me crazy after forty minutes.and anyhow , if we go to the latin club you could actually learn some latin dance steps.at the new bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.and then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . i know you . __eou__ it's fine with me if we go to the latin club . i like latin music.the only thing i never want to do again is listen to country rock.what was that bar called ? __eou__ oh . you mean jerry's , over on the east side.that wasn't my idea going there . __eou__ no . it was that friend of yours , melissa.her and all her lousy country music cds . yecch ! __eou__ it's true . i would never go there again either.country music is a nightmare . so is it the latin club ? __eou__ yes . you have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . __eou__ well , it seems you'll have to learn some spanish too , won't you ? __eou__ maybe .
nick ! how ’ s it going ? __eou__ oh , hey ... __eou__ what are you doing in this neighbourhood ? do you live around here ? __eou__ actually , my office is right around the corner . __eou__ it was great to meet you last week at the conference . i really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . __eou__ yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . you know , i'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . we should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . __eou__ sure , you still have my contact details , right ? __eou__ you know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . can you remind me ? __eou__ sure , my name is ana ferris . don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . i ’ m terrible with names too .
i heard you were teaching english over there.tell me about it . did you like it ? __eou__ oh , yes , it was very interesting . __eou__ what were the schools like ? __eou__ oh , i didn't actually teach in the schools . i taught after school . i taught in english institutes . __eou__ but you taught children , yes ? __eou__ yes . that's right.but children in taiwan are very different from children in america.at least as far as studying is concerned.many children in taiwan go to special institutes after school . __eou__ they actually study after school ? __eou__ that's right.after their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or english.they are very serious about learning over there . __eou__ hmm . that sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . don't they ever relax ? __eou__ of course they do.you know , eliza , before i went over there i thought the same thing . i thought that maybe kids in taiwan study too much.but now that i've worked there , and taught them , i feel it is a good thing.their parents are very concerned about their education . more than american parents are . and that is good . american kids don't study enough . __eou__ asian cultures value learning very much . i know that . __eou__ so it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.they would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . i don't think that's a bad thing . i think it's a good thing.in america , too many parents don't pay attention . __eou__ but aren't the kids tired out ? i mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . __eou__ as an english teacher , i tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . i tried to have a good time with my classes . the students often enjoyed it.and if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . so it was a good experience . __eou__ are the kids in taiwan very obedient ? __eou__ that's a stereotype we americans have.we think that asian kids are very obedient and quiet.but it's not true . there are plenty of naughty kids too . __eou__ hmm . i know you taught in costa rica also.which did you like better--costa rica or taiwan ? __eou__ i don't know . in costa rica , i taught adults.so it was a very different thing . so i really can't compare .
how did you get around over there ? did you rent cars ? __eou__ no , that would be too expensive . we used the train system.we bought a special pass called a enrail pass . it lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . __eou__ i've heard about enrail passes.so those europeans really depend on trains a lot . __eou__ yes , they do . i wish we americans had a better train system . __eou__ i know . our train system is lousy.and besides , americans love their cars too much . __eou__ i agree . and probably the automobile companies are too powerful.they never allowed the government to develop trains . __eou__ it's too bad for the environment . so much pollution from cars . __eou__ americans love cars for different reasons , i think.one reason is that we are very individualistic.and cars are a very individual way of getting around.americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.they don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . __eou__ yes , i agree . i think it is a cultural characteristic.it would be very hard to get us americans to change this.but you know what ? probably , in the future , americans will have to change . __eou__ why do you say " have to " ? __eou__ because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . i think cars are already causing global warming.when the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . __eou__ maybe you're right . they will have to develop alternative transportation.but it will be hard in america . too many people are used to cars.even in our movies cars are very important . __eou__ wow ! i didn't notice the time.it ' s almost noon . i have to get home . __eou__ do you want me to give you a ride ? __eou__ no , no problem . i have my car in the parking ramp around the corner . __eou__ alright.well , i'll stay here and have another coffee . nice running into you . __eou__ see you around .
it ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . the air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ would you like to live in the country ? i ’ m not sure i ’ d like it . __eou__ i can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . the problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ well , i hate the noise in the city , but i love being around lost of people . the problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . the tow just don ’ t go together . __eou__ i see what you mean . i love being far away from a city , but i hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ people can ’ t have it both ways . if you live in the country , it is often less convenient . if you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . __eou__ i would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . they ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ i would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . when the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ the view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . there ’ s so sign of pollution . the village looks so peaceful . __eou__ just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . there ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . there ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ you ’ re right . i would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . i would hate living in the country !
i ’ d love to have my own farm . __eou__ it would be very hard work . are you sure ? __eou__ i wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . __eou__ running a farm would be totally different to you current job . __eou__ that ’ s one reason i ’ d like to try it . i ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . __eou__ you ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . it ’ s not something you can just walk into . __eou__ my uncle owns a farm and i ’ ve spent some time working with him . i love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . __eou__ well , i ‘ d certainly come and visit you . it would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . i ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while .
what ’ s your city like ? __eou__ it ’ s quite an interesting place to live . the best thing to do in my city is go shopping . there are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . __eou__ is the traffic bad in the city centre ? __eou__ not really . cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . the public transport system is pretty good . __eou__ what about restaurants and entertainment ? __eou__ there are restaurants with food from all over the world . we have a small china-town near the city centre . there are many indian , thai , and italian restaurants all over the city centre . there are many s __eou__ is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? __eou__ there are several good clubs near the city centre . many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . __eou__ it sounds like a really exciting city to live in . __eou__ it is . i hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . you really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors .
is your city a historical place ? __eou__ not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . __eou__ how did it grow into such a large place ? __eou__ large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . the village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . __eou__ as the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . __eou__ yes , it did . the names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . __eou__ i see . are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? __eou__ oh , yes . several of the buildings from the villages still survive . many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . there was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . __eou__ really ? so your city does have some old history after all .
do you believe in ufo's ? __eou__ sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it , our space shuttles are ufos . __eou__ i've never thought about it like that before . __eou__ i've seen photos of ufos in america before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__ do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__ i think there must be . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ i don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . the world is just far too big for that . __eou__ do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__ no , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__ i suppose you're right . __eou__ i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__ do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ? __eou__ there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but i don't think it's going to happen any time soon .
i haven't met you at the gym for a long time . __eou__ yeah , i quit my job , and started working from home . recently i've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out . __eou__ why ? you have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . __eou__ it's not about pay raise or promotion . you know , i hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night . __eou__ then soho is your ideal work style . __eou__ yeah , as long as i have a computer and internet access , i can start working . i recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace . __eou__ and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control . __eou__ absolutely . i can decide when and what to do all by myself . __eou__ sounds great . are there many business opportunity ? __eou__ yeah , i can find enough online . __eou__ it's good to have business around . but you should also do some exercise to keep fit . __eou__ thank you for reminding me . i'll continue to exercise as soon as i finish this project .
hello , jim . what was the film like ? __eou__ awful . it was a complete waste of time . __eou__ why ? what was it about ? __eou__ it was about a married couple . they had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . __eou__ a lot of young people have to do that . __eou__ yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . __eou__ lt sounds like the story of my life . __eou__ yes , it does , doesn't it ? but this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.so he used to take two sleeping pill every night . __eou__ i take sleeping pills sometimes . __eou__ yes , but not two every night . anyway , the strain was too much for him . he had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . __eou__ it sounds a very depressing film . __eou__ not really . his wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak french and german fluently . after a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . so in the end , __eou__ i don't know . my wife used to speak french . i must tell her to brush it up .
hi , kenny . let's go for a drink . __eou__ sounds good . where are we going ? __eou__ somewhere new . it's a great place to pick up chicks . __eou__ need a new . girlfriend , huh ? __eou__ yeah , i broke up with lisa.she blew a gasket over it . whoa , get a load of that ! __eou__ whew ! that getup is terrific ! __eou__ never mind the getup.she ' s beautiful ! __eou__ that too . __eou__ i'm gonna introduce myself . __eou__ if you're lucky , that might do the trick . __eou__ oh , oh , that tears it ! i'm getting out of here . __eou__ hold on ! what's the big hurry ? __eou__ my ex-girlfriend's here.if she sees me , my goose is cooked . __eou__ i wanna finish my drink first . i'll meet you at sammy's . __eou__ ok , catch you later .
what's the problem , nada ? you look down in the dumps . __eou__ i don't know . my life is a big mess . everything is so complicated . __eou__ come on , nothing can be that bad . __eou__ but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . __eou__ ok , i promise . so what's troubling you so much ? __eou__ i've fallen in love with my boss . __eou__ really ? is he married ? __eou__ no , of course not . he is still single . __eou__ then what's your problem ? __eou__ i try to keep it to myself . but there is a lot of gossip about us . __eou__ oh , i see . office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . __eou__ worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . __eou__ office romance is very tricky . __eou__ it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed . __eou__ cheer up , nada . you'll be fine .
mike , what are you doing tonight ? __eou__ nothing special . i just want to get plastered . __eou__ i don't feel like drinking tonight . i'm gonna hang out at yy's . __eou__ yy's ? that place is boring . how about xara's ? it's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . __eou__ yeah , but it's expensive . nah , i'm going to yy's . __eou__ on second thought , i think i'll join you . __eou__ they ' ve just renovated the place . you may be surprised . __eou__ wow , they really went to town on this place ! __eou__ quite a difference , huh ? __eou__ sure is . waiter , bring us two drafts , please . __eou__ ah hah.thought you were't drinking . __eou__ when in rome , do as the romans do .
hi , bob , i am so glad that you came . __eou__ of course i'd come . i couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends . __eou__ yeah . it's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas . __eou__ how time flies . but hey , how are things going with you ? __eou__ oh , where to start ? there have been ups and downs . i'm still trying to find my place in this world . it's only recently that i've been able to start settling down . how about you ? you still with jenn __eou__ yeah , jenny and i got married right after graduation . it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . i was supporting us both while she continued her studies . but now things are getting better __eou__ oh , that sounds wonderful . i have always known you two would make it . i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys . i don't want us to drift apart again . __eou__ definitely ! actually , we just moved into a new place . there's a house-warming party this saturday , if you are free ? i know jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party . __eou__ sounds great ! i'll be there .
how's it going ? __eou__ i'm in a good mood today , actually . how about you ? __eou__ to be honest , i'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ there's a girl in my company that i really like but i always get shy when she is around . __eou__ i see ! do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ sure , but how ? __eou__ you can ask her out for drink after work . __eou__ but for what reasons ? she doesn't even know who i am . __eou__ then you've got a lot of homework to do . you need to get her notice first . __eou__ easier said than done . __eou__ you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . __eou__ but i always get tongue-tied when i see her . __eou__ that's something you need to overcome . men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . __eou__ i see . i'll try . __eou__ good luck !
hi , mary . i haven't seen you in ages ! i heard that you and daniel are getting married on august 8th , the opening day of the 2008 olympic games . is it true ? __eou__ yes , it is . we've been dating for over 7 years . we have decided to get married on a special day and we think august 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . __eou__ good for you ! it sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . __eou__ yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... __eou__ is everything ready now ? __eou__ almost . the only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . as a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . __eou__ have you tried the peninsula palace beijing ? my wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . __eou__ yes , we called , but it is booked up . the only choice is the regent beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . __eou__ it's an excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . we don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . __eou__ i guess you're right . i can help you ask other hotels . i am sure there are probably some available . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ my pleasure .
how are you doing , christopher ? __eou__ to be honest , i'm really fed up with work at the moment . i need a break ! __eou__ are you doing anything this weekend ? __eou__ i have to work on saturday all day ! i really hate my job ! __eou__ are you available on sunday ? __eou__ yes , that's my only day off until thursday . __eou__ ok , well , my friends and i are planning on going to the beach on sunday . we tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . do you want to come with us ? __eou__ that'd be fantastic ! which beach are you going to ? __eou__ it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . __eou__ what should i bring with me ? __eou__ we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . __eou__ i can just use my beach towel . i love lazing around in the sun . __eou__ do you like surfing ? __eou__ i've actually never tired . do you have a surfboard ? __eou__ we've got a few . i can teach you how to surf on sunday . it'll be fun ! __eou__ i can't wait ! it sounds like we're going to have a great time . how much money should i bring ? __eou__ you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . my friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . __eou__ ok , where and when should i meet you ? __eou__ we'll pick you up at your place at noon . be there or be square !
have you ever been to disneyworld ? __eou__ when i was young , my parents took me to the one in california . i always forget which — is that one disneyland or disneyworld ? __eou__ the one in florida is disneyworld and the one in california is disneyland , so you must have been to disneyland . __eou__ that's right . why do you ask ? __eou__ well , i've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon . __eou__ when are you getting married ? __eou__ some time next year . we haven't set the date yet . __eou__ congratulations ! i had no idea . __eou__ thank you . so what do you think ? would we have a good time ? __eou__ do you like amusement parks ? __eou__ for the most part , yes . some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . __eou__ if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . __eou__ even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? __eou__ even those . it'll be very romantic , i think . you'll have loads of fun . __eou__ thanks for the advice . i'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . __eou__ i'm sure he'll love the idea . just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
jack and mary broke up . __eou__ it ’ s so sad . they had been together for only two months . do you know what the matter was ? __eou__ mary said jack was cheating on her . jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . one day , mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ really ? i ’ m very surprised . he doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? __eou__ no , he doesn ’ t . anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . __eou__ maybe it is for the best . they are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . __eou__ how so ? __eou__ he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . he likes parties while she hates them . __eou__ poor mary ! she really liked him . __eou__ anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . __eou__ do you think they ’ ll get back together ? __eou__ no , i don ’ t think so . i know mary . once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . __eou__ i hope she ’ ll recover soon . __eou__ so do i .
how do you usually get to school ? __eou__ i usually ride my bike . which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ i feel that i can see more when i pedal a bicycle , but when i feel lazy , i drive my car . __eou__ i think we should discourage people from using their private cars . they produce too much pollution ! __eou__ i agree , but i would find it difficult to stop using my car . it's just so convenient . __eou__ cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . __eou__ do you have a car ? __eou__ no . i used to have one though . once i started using my bicycle to get around , i found that i didn't really need it . __eou__ maybe if i sold my car now , i wouldn't be so tempted to use it . __eou__ you could try . it would save you a lot of money . __eou__ that's true . every month , i spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . __eou__ if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! __eou__ i could stand to lose a few pounds . having a car has made me lazy . i never end up walking anywhere ! __eou__ let's go to a car dealership . i'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . __eou__ sounds good ! let's go !
this is tough to say , jordan , but i think we should break up . __eou__ are you serious ? __eou__ yes , i mean it . __eou__ but why ? did i do anything wrong ? __eou__ no , we are just too different . this isn ’ t working . __eou__ hey , come on . it ’ s too early to say that . we can fix things . __eou__ i have thought about it for a while . i think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . __eou__ but i still love you . __eou__ i ’ m sorry . __eou__ i knew this would happen some day ... __eou__ then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? __eou__ well . it ’ s not all my fault , anna ... __eou__ i don't want to argue with you anymore . this is going to be tough , but let ’ s try and be friends . __eou__ i would like that anna , but i think i ’ ll need a little space for a bit . __eou__ i think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . __eou__ shall we keep our friendship ? __eou__ sure , let ’ s just be friends .
hello , deva , how are you ? __eou__ can't complain . what about you ? __eou__ not bad . have you heard wendy divorced her husband ? __eou__ i've heard . she looks quite depressed . __eou__ yes . they used to be joined at the hip . __eou__ i heard they were just married for 5 months . __eou__ yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . __eou__ yeah . mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . __eou__ you said it . you know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . __eou__ maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . __eou__ yeah . we chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . __eou__ definitely . that's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . __eou__ we've heard so much about chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . __eou__ that's true.just hope wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon .
what are you listening to ? is that beethoven or mozart ? __eou__ it's beethoven . do you like it ? __eou__ i think beethoven's music is incredible . i've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . do you believe that ? __eou__ i don't know about that , but i do think that it helps people relax . __eou__ what other kind of music do you listen to ? __eou__ actually , i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ? __eou__ to be honest , i think classical music is too complicated for me . __eou__ what kind of music do you prefer then ? __eou__ i like pop music . do you ? __eou__ not really . i don't think pop music has much depth . __eou__ i see what you mean . i think that's way i like it so much . __eou__ how long have you been in to pop music , then ? __eou__ i've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ? __eou__ not really . when i was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . __eou__ so , how did you become interested in it ? __eou__ well , when i was about 10 years old , i started playing the piano . i think that's how it all started . __eou__ do you still play piano ? __eou__ yes , it's one of my hobbies .

hi , come on in . can i take your coat ? __eou__ sure , thanks . i brought you a bottle of wine as well . __eou__ you're the first guest to arrive . i'll just put your coat away and then i'll get you something to drink . __eou__ should i take my shoes off ? __eou__ whatever you prefer . __eou__ this is a very nice place . how long have you been living here now ? __eou__ just over three weeks . would you like a drink ? __eou__ sure , what do you have ? __eou__ i've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . __eou__ i'll have a glass of red wine please . __eou__ one glass of red wine coming up ! __eou__ so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? __eou__ there's just going to be 6 of us tonight . __eou__ oh , i thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? __eou__ marcia and paul called to cancel at the last moment . paul was running late and marcia wasn't feeling well . __eou__ that's too bad.they ' re such good company . __eou__ i think there's someone at the door . __eou__ excuse me while i go and get that .

how's it going ? __eou__ i'm in a really good mood , actually . how about you ? __eou__ to be honest , i'm a bit fed up . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . __eou__ that's too bad . i'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . don't be too upset about it . __eou__ the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . __eou__ i see how that can get a bit annoying . __eou__ a bit ? i'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! he's such a liar . __eou__ so what are you going to do about it ? __eou__ i don't know . i've got mixed feelings about it . on the one hand , i really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , i don't want to be without him . __eou__ what do you think would make you happier ? __eou__ in the long run , i think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but i know that i'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . __eou__ relationships can be confusing sometimes . __eou__ what would you do if you were me ? __eou__ i'd call him and dump him now ! you deserve better than him !
so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ? __eou__ i'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ? __eou__ i like to do just about anything outdoors . do you enjoy camping ? __eou__ camping for an evening is ok , but i couldn't do it for much longer than one night ! __eou__ have you ever been camping in the boundary waters ? __eou__ no , but i've always wanted to do that . i've heard it's a beautiful place to go . __eou__ it's fantastic . my family and i are very fond of the place . __eou__ do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ? __eou__ sure , would you like to see them ? __eou__ that'd be great . what kind of camera do you have ? __eou__ i have a canon slr . __eou__ so , you must be pretty interested in photography then . __eou__ i'd call it one of my hobbies . do you know much about photography ? __eou__ actually , i do . i took quite a few photography classes at university . __eou__ have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ? __eou__ yes , i was planning on going . are you ? __eou__ yes.in fact , maybe we could go together . __eou__ that'd be great . what time should i meet you there ? __eou__ how about at 11:00 ? __eou__ sounds great . see you then .
why are you in such a good mood today ? __eou__ well , yesterday , i decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__ i didn't know you were scared of heights ! was it really bad ? __eou__ let me put it this way . i've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because i could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . __eou__ so what did you do about it yesterday ? __eou__ i went sky-diving ! __eou__ you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__ it was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__ weren't you scared ? __eou__ of course i was scared . but i had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__ so have you cured your fear of heights ? __eou__ i think so . after i jumped out of the plane , i realized that i should just enjoy life . worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . __eou__ i'm impressed . __eou__ are you scared of anything ? __eou__ well , sometimes i get scared when i'm in my apartment all by myself . __eou__ what do you think is going to happen ? __eou__ i always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . __eou__ it sounds like you just need to be more careful .
what sort of music do you like ? __eou__ i love just about anything by prince . __eou__ so , you're into 80s music then ? __eou__ well , i like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . how about you ? __eou__ i like alternative music . __eou__ do you have a favorite band ? __eou__ to be honest , no . i'm always in search of new music to listen to . __eou__ do you often go to concerts ? __eou__ i usually go to see a live band about twice a month . what about you ? __eou__ i love going to live gigs . are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? __eou__ there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . you should come along next week with me . __eou__ i'd love to , but i have a night class on thursdays . __eou__ that's too bad . maybe another time . __eou__ let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . i have more free time then . __eou__ i'll let you know . did you want to watch some tv ? __eou__ sure , what's on ? __eou__ there's a reality tv show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight . __eou__ that sounds dreadful !
do you need a hand ? __eou__ no , i can handle it . thanks anyway . __eou__ are you sure you don't need any help ? __eou__ well , maybe just a little . i can't seem to make it fit . __eou__ i swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller ! __eou__ that's so true . thanks for your help . are you in the aisle seat in this row ? __eou__ yes . what about you ? __eou__ i'm in the middle seat . __eou__ oh , i guess i'll let you through then . __eou__ thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again . __eou__ that's alright . i notice you have a few newspapers there . would you mind lending me one ? __eou__ no , not at all . which one would you like--the new york times or the guardian ? __eou__ i prefer the british paper , but i'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away . __eou__ i was just going to do a little sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the guardian is all yours . __eou__ thanks a lot . that's really nice of you . would you like a piece of gum ? __eou__ that would be great . thanks .
did you enjoy that new movie ? __eou__ that movie's just a lot of noise , same as simon . __eou__ oh , what happened , carole ? __eou__ i had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . __eou__ what ? i met him just before i took off from kitty's , he said he was coming . __eou__ kitty's ? he sure gets around , doesn't he ? __eou__ looks like it . so how did he handle it to ? __eou__ his excuse was familiar . he said his car died again . __eou__ i think that's a bunch of nonsense . it seemed ok to me . __eou__ i know . last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . __eou__ doesn't sound promising . __eou__ well , i think it's the time to pull the plug . __eou__ if you want i'll let him know if i run into him . __eou__ thanks anyway , but i'll do it , rebecca . let's get the class .
excuse me ; is this seat taken ? __eou__ no . it's all yours . __eou__ thank you very much . my name is ashlan . it's nice to meet you . __eou__ carson . it's nice to mee you , too . __eou__ the weather is so warm for december , don't you think ? __eou__ it is unusually warm . i blame it on global warming . __eou__ global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere . __eou__ so sure . are you from around here ? __eou__ no . i'm new here . i just moved here a few months ago . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ i'm from china . what about you ? __eou__ i am from texas . i was in china once , but it was a long time ago . __eou__ did you enjoy it ? __eou__ i did . i especially liked the food . what do you think about the food here ? __eou__ it's very different from chinese food , but i am getting used to it . __eou__ is that the da vinci code that you've got there ? __eou__ yes , have you read it ? __eou__ no , but i saw the movie . what do you think about it ? __eou__ well , to be honest , i've only gotten though 10 pages of it . so far , though , it's interesting . __eou__ well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you . __eou__ likewise . bye !

hey , jack , where's your car ? __eou__ i got rid of that clunker . this is my new one . __eou__ is that right ? it sure beats the old one ? __eou__ jump in , i'll give you a ride . __eou__ ok . boy , this looks expensive . __eou__ yeah , it costed a bundle alright . __eou__ wow , this's sinking a hole . __eou__ yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing i've ever owned . __eou__ i believe it . hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . __eou__ we are on the high way . i'm the * * . __eou__ wow , this car can really burn rubber . __eou__ it's a great feeling . __eou__ you made a perfect choice , jack . __eou__ thanks , daisy .
thanks for inviting me to work out with you , joan . __eou__ don't mention it , let's go in . __eou__ yeah , this place looks great . wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? __eou__ she sure can . are you jealous , leslie ? __eou__ a little , i wish i could do that . __eou__ you can ! with a little practice . __eou__ look at him , he's buff . __eou__ i think he's hot too . __eou__ how do they all get in such tiptop shape ? __eou__ exercised over and over . exercise is a key . __eou__ that's it . i decided to turn over a new leaf . i'm going to exercise every single day . __eou__ good for you , leslie !
hi paul . how are you , friend . __eou__ not good . my cousin is driving me up the wall . __eou__ how so ? __eou__ he stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . __eou__ have you talk to him about it ? __eou__ not yet , but i have to soon . he's eating me out of house and home . i caught him reading the fridge again last night __eou__ ahahah , maybe that will help you lose weight . __eou__ this is no laughing matter , nick . __eou__ sorry paul . i couldn't help it . so why doesn't he give you a hand ? __eou__ he watch the tob too much . now really i don't know . but i can't handle this much longer . __eou__ well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , ok ?
hi , mikel . what's with you ? you look angry . __eou__ no , i just check my weight , i'm getting fatter . __eou__ true , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ? __eou__ i'll get you for that comments , george . __eou__ just kidding , mikel . why don't you come work out with me ? __eou__ ah , i don't know a fit works . last time , all i saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me . __eou__ it works if you keep at it . come on , let's go ! __eou__ all right . but so help me it's a better work . __eou__ this feels great . i'm all reed up . i can keep going all night . __eou__ not me . i'm too hot and i'm too tired . __eou__ exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig . __eou__ well , that's not for me . __eou__ thanks for coming , it was a real blessed . __eou__ it wasn't as good as you think . __eou__ you'll get used to it , mikel , trust me .
you look like a basket case . __eou__ i'm not surprised . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ my brother in-law just dropped in from the states . __eou__ yeah , and ? __eou__ i decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! __eou__ why ? __eou__ he's lazy . i tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . __eou__ i guess you think twice next time he comes . __eou__ you can say that again . __eou__ so how long has he here for ? __eou__ two weeks . if he thinks i'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . __eou__ well , i know you do the right thing .
good morning ! __eou__ good morning , gav ! did you sleep well last night ? __eou__ i slept like a baby . i fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! __eou__ that's great news ! you look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . __eou__ i feel much better , but i'm still worried about something . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ well , i have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and i'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . __eou__ that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . __eou__ for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because i'm pretty impatient . how can i prevent myself from getting stressed if i get stuck in a traffic jam ? __eou__ just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . __eou__ ok , i'll try that . __eou__ is there anything else bothering you ? __eou__ just one more thing . a school called me this morning to see if i could teach a few classes this weekend and i don't know what to do . __eou__ do you have any other plans this weekend ? __eou__ i'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on monday . __eou__ try not to take on more than you can handle . __eou__ you're right . i probably should just work on my paper . thanks !
wow ! you're going to tibet ? __eou__ yes , my brothe and i are going . we just finished making our itinerary . __eou__ that's really cool ! i've always dreamed of going somewhere like tibet , seeing something unique . __eou__ great minds think alike . my brother and i have been thinking about going to tibet for quite a long time . do you have anything on your schedule ? __eou__ nothing particular . __eou__ why don't you join us ? we are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare . __eou__ oh , tibet sounds great , but i'm afraid it'll cost too much . last time i traveled to india , and it cost me a fortune . __eou__ come on ! we're traveling on our own . it won't cost too much . __eou__ ok , then count me in . where will we stay ? __eou__ the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap . __eou__ then make sure that you book me a room , too . __eou__ i'll take care of it . __eou__ and check whether they accept credit cards . __eou__ no problem .
how come you're still up ? shouldn't you be asleep by now ? __eou__ i've been having a hard time sleeping lately . __eou__ as far as i know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . are you stressed at all ? __eou__ well , i'm really worried about my grades . i didn't think this course would be so stressful . __eou__ you're a good student . i'm sure you can do well . what you need to do is to relax . __eou__ you're probably right . i just wish it were that simple . how can i stop feeling so anxious all the time ? __eou__ taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . __eou__ i don't really have time to learn anything new . i need to spend my time studying ! __eou__ you need to take some breaks throughout the day . studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . __eou__ you ’ re right . i usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . __eou__ besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . in fact , i can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! you just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . __eou__ that ’ s fantastic . i ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! __eou__ good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite !
what's wrong , jerry ? you look so upset . __eou__ to be honest , i was just dumped . __eou__ oh , i'm sorry to hear that . you can go on a holiday to cheer you up . __eou__ no , thanks . i'm not in the mood for traveling . __eou__ come on . a trip will do you good . are you doing anything this weekend ? __eou__ i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . __eou__ well , my friends and i are planning on going to shangri-la on saturday . do you want to come with us ? __eou__ where is that ? __eou__ not very far from here . we'll fly . it's about one and a half hours . __eou__ what's there to see ? __eou__ there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . __eou__ oh , sounds nice . __eou__ yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like . __eou__ ok . then i can make up my mind .
hi , darling ! i have a one-month vacation saved up . how about a trip to europe ? __eou__ i could go for that . but i'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . __eou__ oh , but i really need to leave this town for a change . working day after day has worn me out . do you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . how about the countryside ? there must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec __eou__ wonderful ! i think that's a great idea . how soon until we can make this happen ? i can't wait ! __eou__ tomorrow i have an appointment with my dentist . what about next monday ? __eou__ perfect . i'll start preparing tomorrow . if we're going to drive , i'll need to fill up the tank . __eou__ no need . i think it's still plenty full . even so , i'd rather travel by bus or train . it would cost much less than driving . oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . __eou__ we can take the train , that will be faster . i'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . __eou__ great ! oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . i'd hate to get caught in the rain . __eou__ no problem . i'm really looking forward to the coming week . __eou__ me , too . now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
what a nice day ! __eou__ yes . how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? __eou__ great , let's go ! __eou__ hey , darling , i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world . __eou__ exactly . you know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . you remember ? the island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... __eou__ yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . how time flies ! __eou__ why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? we can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . __eou__ are you kidding ? can you afford it ? do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? __eou__ never mind that , i'll take care of it . are you available next week ? __eou__ yeah , i think so . __eou__ ok . i'll make the arrangements . it will be great . __eou__ wonderful ! i'll start packing our suitcases .
hey , mary , what's up ? __eou__ not much . last night i met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . __eou__ oh , that's exciting . what's this guy like ? is he hot ? __eou__ well , i didn't think so at first . but as we started talking , i found his extremely funny and witty . i couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! we have so much in common . we like the same teams , music , a __eou__ it seems you two are a good match . what qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ there's nothing definite i think . i don't have a list or anything , but when i first meet somebody , i can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . it seems i have radar h __eou__ well , that's something i've never heard of . but if you as me what i value most in a friend , i would have to say honesty . __eou__ i agree . you can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . __eou__ yeah , i know . a friend in need is a friend indeed . i don't need fair-weather friends either .
we still have one more day to go before we return home . what will we see tomorrow ? __eou__ no idea . we've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . what else is there to see ? __eou__ what about a factory tour ? __eou__ you mean visit a factory ? __eou__ yes . i heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . we can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . __eou__ good idea ! i've always been interested in that . how much is the entrance fee ? __eou__ i'm not sure , but as far as i know , most factory tours are free . they are sponsored by the company providing the tour . __eou__ really ? what do the companies do that for ? __eou__ i believe most of them think of it as good public relations . they can promote their product and make their company better-known . __eou__ oh , i see . so factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . __eou__ exactly . __eou__ do we need an appointment beforehand ? __eou__ i'll call the tourist information centre to check .
excuse me , is this the way to the greta wall ? __eou__ oh , it is really far from here . you ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . __eou__ i must have taken a wrong turn . __eou__ it doesn ’ t matter . go back the way you came . after about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . it ’ s a big one . you can ’ t miss it . __eou__ and then ? __eou__ take the next right . drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the great wall . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . __eou__ by the way , how long does it take ? __eou__ without traffic , it takes about an hour . __eou__ i heard the great wall closes early in the afternoon . do you think i can make it before closing ? __eou__ yes , i think so . it doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . you still have plenty of time . __eou__ great ! thank you ! __eou__ my pleasure , and have a good time !
it's a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ yeah , and most excitingly , i met the girl living under me today . she's really nice . __eou__ is she american ? __eou__ yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! man , i could tell from the moment i saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! __eou__ so i take it you two are hitting it off ? i know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? __eou__ i don't know . i am not really worried about that . i don't wanna lose before even starting . besides i think the other two american guys have also fallen for her . __eou__ sounds like you've got some competition . you made a move already ? __eou__ not yet . but i am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . i know some good restaurants nearby . __eou__ that's nice . having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? __eou__ you bet . now that you mentioned it , i think i'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . __eou__ good luck ! __eou__ thanks !
hey , lucas , how was your trip to paris ? __eou__ it was wonderful , but i was so tired . __eou__ did you go to the top of the eiffel tower ? __eou__ yes , that was the first thing we did . we went all the way to the top . there were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . __eou__ what else did you see ? __eou__ art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . __eou__ you must have had a great time . __eou__ yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . however , on the third day of traveling in the city , i felt sick . i think i had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . __eou__ yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . sometimes new food might disagree with you . __eou__ on the fouth day , we went to taste the french cuisine . that was really fantastic ! and no stomach problems . __eou__ that is great . everyone says french food is wonderful . __eou__ you'll have to try for yourself some day .
jessica is going back to holland next week . i've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but i still have no clue . __eou__ is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? __eou__ yeah , that's her . we had a lot of wonderful times together . she is really a special friend , and i want to get her something meaningful . __eou__ i am not good at picking gifts . maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? __eou__ i don't think so . that way it would lose all the charm . i want it to be a surprise . i want to show her that i care about her and i hope our friendship will last . __eou__ yeah , that's nice . __eou__ hmm , i think i've got an idea . maybe i can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . __eou__ a plant ? that's creative . i'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . but there is a problem . do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? __eou__ i hope so . i'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . i hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . __eou__ i don't know . i think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . you don't want to get her in trouble .
who are you writing a letter to ? __eou__ i'm just responding to sue's letter . do you want to help ? __eou__ ok . i guess i could add something . tell them that i send my love . __eou__ that's kind of boring . don't you want to tell them anything else ? __eou__ well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . __eou__ you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? __eou__ just today . i guess i forgot to mention it . __eou__ congratulations ! that's really exciting ! let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! __eou__ shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? __eou__ ah . that can wait . your promotion is the best news i've heard in a long time ! __eou__ it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . we might as well just sign off . __eou__ ok , you're right . i'll just tell them how round i am of you for getting a promotion and then i'll thank sue for her kind letter . __eou__ i guess you can write that i'm looking forward to seeing them in june . __eou__ that's thoughtful of you . __eou__ and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the christmas package they sent us . __eou__ that's right ! i almost forgot about that . __eou__ what would you do without me ? __eou__ we do balance each other out well . i guess we were really made for each other !
have you heard about the new iphone ? __eou__ yes , i heard it's supposed to come out in june . are you thinking about getting one ? __eou__ i'd like to . it's a cell phone , camera , pad and mp3 player all in one . __eou__ if i had enough money , i'd buy one , but i don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . __eou__ how big is a shuffle ipod ? __eou__ the first generation ipod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation ipod shuffle is about half the size of the first . __eou__ how many gigs of music can it hold ? __eou__ i think it's either one or two gigs . i can't remember . __eou__ how much do they cost ? __eou__ not much at all . i think it's about 100 dollars . __eou__ you're right , that's not bad at all . __eou__ do you have an ipod ? __eou__ i got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , i never brought another one . __eou__ why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? __eou__ that's one of the problems with having an ipod . though an ipod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your ipod .
what are you looking for ? __eou__ i want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . __eou__ do you know what camcorder options are available ? __eou__ not really . i thought i'd just have a look today . __eou__ would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? __eou__ sure . i'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . __eou__ ok . this sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . why don't you see if you like the way it feel ? __eou__ it's very light . that would be good . how is the battery life ? __eou__ it's got an above-average battery life . it lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . __eou__ can you also take still photos with this ? __eou__ yes , that is an option . __eou__ how about night vision ? can you use it in the dark ? __eou__ yes . i can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . __eou__ that's not bad at all . how's the microphone ? does it pick up much sound ? __eou__ it can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . __eou__ how does that compare with other models ? __eou__ there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . __eou__ i guess you can't have everything , can you ?
what's up ? __eou__ not much . i'm just trying to hook up to the internet . i'm having a few problems though . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ i've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that i'm offline . __eou__ are you using dial-up or broadband ? __eou__ actually , i've got a wireless connection . __eou__ in that case , you need to turn on your airport . __eou__ i hook up to the internet every day . i can't believe i didn't do that . __eou__ do you like ever chat online ? __eou__ no , but i'd like to . do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? __eou__ oh , no . you can register for free . just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . __eou__ what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? __eou__ well , you can always block them . when i don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what i do . __eou__ what's your email address ? i'll add you to my contacts list . __eou__ it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com . __eou__ cool . we can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . __eou__ don't mention it .
you wouldn't believe what i got in the mail today ! __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ it's a letter from ray and sue in shanghai ! __eou__ have you read it yet ? __eou__ no , i thought i'd wait until you got home . __eou__ go on , read it out loud . __eou__ ok . it says , " dear jessica . it was so good to receive you letter . i sounds like you and riley are settling into your new home with ease ... " __eou__ when did you send her a letter ? __eou__ just a few weeks ago . sue and i send letters to each other often . __eou__ i didn't know anyone did that any more . ok , go on . __eou__ ok ... i'm going to have to skip over this section . it's girl-talk . __eou__ that's fine with me . __eou__ oh . it's actually all rather personal . __eou__ well , skip over all of that and read me the rest . __eou__ ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " ray and i look forward to seeing you in june . write soon . with love , sue . " __eou__ are we going to see them in june or are they coming to see us ? __eou__ didn't i tell you ? we're going to shanghai to stay with them in june . __eou__ oh , i guess i missed that . __eou__ men !
is that your phone ? __eou__ yes , it's my new business phone . do you like it ? __eou__ it's very impressive . can you use the internet on your phone ? __eou__ yes , it's got wireless internet access . __eou__ that's really convenient . does it have the bluetooth ? __eou__ yes , but i don't really use it that often . have you ever used it ? __eou__ no , but i think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . __eou__ yes , i guess i should try to use it . __eou__ does it have a camera ? __eou__ of course it does . doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? __eou__ i guess so . would you mind if i checked my email quickly ? i'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . __eou__ sure . here you go . __eou__ have you checked your voicemail recently ? __eou__ no , why ? __eou__ i think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . __eou__ oh , yeah . probably . i don't really know how to use this phone yet . __eou__ do you want to listen to your messages first ? __eou__ no , it's ok . check your email first ; i'll check my unbox later . __eou__ i'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . __eou__ i'm surprised you know so much about it . where's your phone ? __eou__ it quit working last week and i haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . __eou__ how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? __eou__ it's not that bad . it kind of feels like i'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! __eou__ let's go shopping . you can't depend on public phones in this day and age !
do you like playing games ? __eou__ i like playing computer games , but i'm not really into board games . __eou__ how about individual games like the rubik's cube or solitaire ? __eou__ the rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that i think it should be banned ! __eou__ if i taught you how to do it , i'm sure you could solve it . __eou__ how did you figure out how to slove the rubik's cube ? __eou__ i didn't really have to figure it out . i just followed the instructions ! __eou__ i had no idea there were a set of instructions . i thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! __eou__ hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . if you give me some hints about playing that ps2 game , i ’ ll show you how to solve the rubik's cube . __eou__ it's a deal . __eou__ do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the new year's party had yo-yos ? __eou__ yeah . that was a strange party . can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? __eou__ i don't know . i haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! __eou__ i could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . __eou__ if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . __eou__ let's get started with this game then . __eou__ ok .
how did your interview go ? __eou__ pretty well . i don't know if i'll get the promotion or not , but i feel good about it . __eou__ if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? __eou__ if i get the promotion , i will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . __eou__ will you get a pay-raise , too ? __eou__ whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . __eou__ that makes sense . who interviewed you ? __eou__ my boss . __eou__ what kinds of questions did she ask you ? __eou__ she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what i thought a good boss should be . __eou__ the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . what did you tell her ? __eou__ i told her that i'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . __eou__ those are good answers . how did she react ? __eou__ she told me that even when i become a senior engineer , i'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . __eou__ what do you think about her as a boss ? __eou__ she's pretty easy to get along with . she listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . __eou__ you're lucky . not everyone has such a great boss ! __eou__ that's true . she's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . __eou__ when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . __eou__ i will do .
could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ first of all , i want you to know that i really like working for this company . do you think i'm doing a good job here ? __eou__ well , you are a very hard-worker . __eou__ i try very hard . the problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . now that i have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . __eou__ there are trying times for everyone . what do you propose ? __eou__ i could really use a 5 % rise . __eou__ that's quite a bit . if i give you a raise , i'm going to have to give everyone a raise . __eou__ listen , if you give me a raise , i'll take on extra responsibilities . __eou__ that sounds reasonable . how about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . that means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . __eou__ that's fine . do i get over-time for any extra hours that i work ? __eou__ of course . it's be against the law if we didn't . __eou__ that sounds good to me . i really appreciate it . __eou__ you are welcome . come in early tomorrow and i'll show you how to do the scheduling .
do you mind if i sit here ? __eou__ no , of course not . go ahead . __eou__ don't i know you ? __eou__ yes , now that you mention it , i think we had a chemistry class together in high school . __eou__ you're right ! how are you ? it's been a long time ! __eou__ what did you do after high school ? __eou__ i went straight to university afterwards . what about you ? __eou__ i took a year off to go travelling . __eou__ that sounds exciting . where did you go ? __eou__ i went all over the world . it was the best year of my life . where did you go to school ? __eou__ i went to a small school in connecticut . it has a very good reputation for its languages department . __eou__ oh , did you study a foreign language ? __eou__ yes , i got a grant to study chinese . __eou__ that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? __eou__ it is , but it's very rewarding . __eou__ so you can speak chinese ? __eou__ i can , but not as well as i'd like to . i'll be studying chinese until the day i die ! __eou__ i think most languages take a lifetime to learn well .
hello . where are you headed today ? __eou__ i'm off to barcelona for a week . __eou__ do you have your passport with you ? __eou__ yes , here you go . i don't need a visa to go to spain , do i ? __eou__ fortunately for you , you don't . next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . __eou__ that's good advice . __eou__ would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__ are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? __eou__ let me see here ... yes , there's one left . __eou__ ok . i'll take that one then . __eou__ alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? __eou__ i like to travel light so i just have this one . __eou__ if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? __eou__ yes , please . that's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ? __eou__ you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . here's your boarding pass . enjoy your flight !
i have some good news for you . we've decided we'd like to send you to shanghai on a business trip this weekend . __eou__ oh . __eou__ don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ i thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . everything will be paid for and i'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . all you have to do it get on the train tonight a __eou__ the train ? will i be flying back then ? __eou__ oh , no . we've brought your return ticket for you . i think you'll find it comfortable . __eou__ will the train be very crowded ? __eou__ oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . __eou__ when is the first meeting then ? __eou__ they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . that should give you enough time to have a quick shower . __eou__ where will i be staying ? __eou__ we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . __eou__ that's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ? __eou__ that's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
the may holiday is coming up soon . are you planning on going on vacation ? __eou__ i am . i just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . __eou__ where are you planning on going ? __eou__ i fancy going to tibet for a few days . have you ever been there ? __eou__ i went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . __eou__ would you recommend going there for a few days ? __eou__ personally , i think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . a few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . __eou__ you ’ re probably right . what do you think about yangshao ? __eou__ it ’ s a beautiful city , but i think it ’ s become too touristy . how about going to a cosmopolitan city like shanghai or hong kong ? __eou__ i ’ d like to get away from the big city life . __eou__ maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of beijing . i heard they are very relaxing . __eou__ i guess if i only have a few days , i should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away . __eou__ since the may holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . here ’ s the phone number . __eou__ thanks ; i ’ ll give them a call later .
hey , frank , there is that janet check . __eou__ wow , what a great burd ! __eou__ she sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__ she's a real turn-on our rights . __eou__ and look out she's dressed . __eou__ yeah , i noticed . she must be really loaded . __eou__ no way . her old man is rich . he buys her anything she wants . __eou__ lucky her . anyway , i think that is just as beautiful . __eou__ i think you've lost it . __eou__ well , that's my opinion . __eou__ i admit that she is much prettier than kate . __eou__ oh , there is no comparison . now we are talking but ugly . __eou__ at least we agree on that . let's go and get a drink .
welcome back ! how was your vacation ? __eou__ it was fantastic , but i'm glad to be back ! being a tourist is really tiring ! __eou__ where did you end up going ? __eou__ because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to paris , so we went there . __eou__ i've always wanted to go to paris . the eiffel tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! did you go to the top ? __eou__ that was the first thing we did . i have a few pictures . do you want to see them ? __eou__ sure . what's this one a picture of ? __eou__ oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . i'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . __eou__ you don't look very happy in that picture . __eou__ no , by that time , i was sick of sightseeing . i had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! __eou__ so what did you do ? __eou__ we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . we had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . __eou__ my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . did you go to the louvre ? __eou__ of course ! you can't go to paris without going to their famous art gallery ! i was surprised by how small the mona lisa was though . __eou__ that's what everyone says ! i can't wait to see it for myself some day .
hi , how are you doing ? __eou__ everything's great . and you ? __eou__ same here . have you seen any new films recently ? __eou__ no , i haven't had a chance to . but i've been watching a chinese tv series called chinese-style divorce . __eou__ oh , really ? i saw it two years ago . it's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . __eou__ yeah . i found it is so close to our life . __eou__ it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . __eou__ you said it . you know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . __eou__ well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . __eou__ i know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . __eou__ oh , that's too short-lived . __eou__ that's true . it's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . __eou__ i can't agree more . the only-child generation in china tends to know little about marriage . __eou__ definitely . they don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . __eou__ in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . __eou__ i think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage .
oh , hi , jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? __eou__ i'd love to , the movies are smash hit . __eou__ then let's go in . __eou__ i can't . i'm waiting for paul , but he's late . __eou__ i'll say the movie's starting in the minute . __eou__ i know . i wonder what's keeping him . __eou__ looks like he won't show up . he's done this before , hasn't he ? __eou__ yeah , a number of times . __eou__ what's he trying to pull anyway . __eou__ i don't know . but this is definitely the last straw . __eou__ maybe you should start seeing someone else . __eou__ you said it . ok , let's go in , sandy .
more and more chinese are marrying foreigners . __eou__ that's true . but i have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . __eou__ oh , why ? __eou__ i think some chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . there is no true love between them . __eou__ i wouldn't say that's totally true . i've met many happy intercultural couples . __eou__ well , then why aren't there many east-west couples where the man is a chinese and the woman is a westerner ? __eou__ i guess it's because the chinese women are more attractive to western men . __eou__ or because they are less attractive to to chinese men . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . __eou__ a left girl ? what's that ? __eou__ they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . they're also known by their three h's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three s's — single , __eou__ you have a point here , but i believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . __eou__ that ' for sure but very few .
if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a chinese ? __eou__ why ? did tom pop the question ? __eou__ not yet . but i wonder if i can get my parents ’ consent . __eou__ let me guess , your parents want you to marry a chinese man , right ? __eou__ you are right . it is giving me a real headache . i feel like i ’ m between a rock and a hard place . __eou__ i used to have the same problem when i was with my ex . __eou__ oh , how did you deal with it ? __eou__ i just let it go and continued dating with my korean boyfriend . but finally we broke up . __eou__ oh , it ’ s a pity . what was the matter ? __eou__ simple . we had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ he hoped to live in the korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . __eou__ oh , i see . in their culture women should put family first . __eou__ yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . but i simply can not quit working . __eou__ so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . __eou__ not really . there are many successful mixed marriage around us .
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? __eou__ what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? __eou__ but we've done that many times . we want something fresh this time . __eou__ okay , let me think . what about a party-and-movie night ? we can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . __eou__ sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . __eou__ well , we can ask people to make small contributions . __eou__ i don ' t think so . i don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . but we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party byob . __eou__ byob ? what's that ? __eou__ bring your own beverage . we can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . __eou__ so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? i don't know how well that will go over . __eou__ maybe you have a point . how about having a party on a friday afternoon ? we'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . there'll be music but no band . having the party in the office will make __eou__ oh , that sounds like fun !
hi , betty ! __eou__ hi , andy , how are you finding your new job ? __eou__ pretty good . my colleagues seem alright . so far everything is great . __eou__ that's nice . what do they have you doing over there ? __eou__ well , i work in the marketing department . the corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . before , when i was assigned a task , i was totally on my own but here most of the work is don __eou__ that ' s really good . it's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . __eou__ indeed . team work is highly valued in this new company . i like our boss too . he is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . he's highly respected by all his employees . __eou__ that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . i wish my boss was like that . __eou__ true , take my former supervisor as an example . he was extremely controlling and overbearing . he always had to micromanage everything . __eou__ well , now you don't have to worry about that . this new place sounds really good . __eou__ yeah it is .
hi , natasha , how's life ? __eou__ great . my family came to visit me . __eou__ oh , you must be very happy . how many people are there in your family ? __eou__ my immediate family is very large . it's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . __eou__ i have a small family . they are my parents , my younger brother and me . __eou__ i thought you were the only child in the family . didn't china practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? __eou__ yes , it did . but my parents are ethnic minority people . it's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . __eou__ interesting . what do you think about families with only one child ? __eou__ the child must feel very longly . my younger brother is 10 years younger than me . before he was born , i used to be the only child and always dreamed that i would have a younger sister or brother one da __eou__ do you get along well with each other ? __eou__ yes , we are very close . he is 12 years old and very smart . he always makes us laugh a lot . __eou__ you are very lucky to have such a nice family . __eou__ thank you .
this party rocks ! __eou__ you said it . good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__ i'm with you on that . check out that one over there . i think i'm in love ! __eou__ well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . what about the blond with the red dress ? __eou__ oh , that's janice . she's just new in town . you have a thing for blonds , eh ? __eou__ yeah ! she could do anything she wants to me ! __eou__ i bet . why not go over and talk to her ? she's really nice . __eou__ i don't think so . i get so nervous talking to girls . i always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . besides , she is way out of my league . __eou__ come on ! man up ! you'll never know until you try . __eou__ okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . __eou__ all right . but i think you ought to move soon . __eou__ why ? __eou__ i can see five other guys eying her up . __eou__ okay , here i go ! __eou__ good luck !
do you have internet in your room ? __eou__ sure , i am a total internet junkie , i can't survive without internet . __eou__ really ? what do you usually do online ? __eou__ well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly i chat online . you could say i'm addicted to online chatting . __eou__ i never chatted online before . what's it like . __eou__ well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . you should try it at least once . __eou__ really ? who do you chat with ? __eou__ to people all over the world ! i have a lot of net pals . see , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . you can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were __eou__ that's amazing . i will install an online messenger program when i get home . __eou__ well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . you know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . there are a lot of per __eou__ don't worry .
org ! it must be so late where you are . what time is it ? __eou__ just after 2 am . __eou__ what's wrong ? can't sleep ? __eou__ nope , actually i was waiting for you . i have something big to tell you . __eou__ really ? what is it ? __eou__ i have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? __eou__ i can't believe it ! is it real ? you're moving here ? __eou__ i haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday i think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . if you have time i think we c __eou__ just give me the dates and i'll make sure i'm free . you know after all these chatting online , it will be great to meet you in real life . i look forward to seeing you soon ! __eou__ me too . but i think i am going to bed now . my head is getting heavy . have a nice day there ! __eou__ thanks . this is so exciting . sleep tight and sweet dreams ! __eou__ talk to you later .
hi , mary ! what do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ well , i spend a lot of time watching movies . __eou__ what a confidence ! i always watch a lot of movies , too . __eou__ oh really , frank ? what kind of movies do you like ? __eou__ actually , i watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . how about you ? __eou__ art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . __eou__ really impressive . these two genres are totally different . __eou__ sure . i enjoy both of them very much . __eou__ how often do you go to the cinema ? __eou__ once in a while , i suppose , i usually rent movies at movie salon . __eou__ movie salon ? where is that ? __eou__ it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . i've got a membership there . __eou__ is it good ? __eou__ yes , you can find almost all new releases there . __eou__ really ? maybe i shall also sign up for its membership . __eou__ why not ?
hello , jason , there is going to be a screening of final destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . i plan to go to see it . __eou__ is it a horror movie ? __eou__ yeah , i love horror movies . would you like to go with me tomorrow ? __eou__ no way . i will be scared out of my wits . __eou__ that's funny , i didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . __eou__ hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? __eou__ alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? __eou__ um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . __eou__ that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . __eou__ yeah . it seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . __eou__ not quite . i also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . __eou__ the notebook is this type of movie . __eou__ really ? i haven't heard of it . __eou__ well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . i bet you'd love it . __eou__ ok . i can't wait to see it . let's go !
bob ! your eyes look bloodshot . did you not sleep well ? __eou__ i had a drop too much last night . i attended a banquet given by a chinese colleague of mine . and it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a chinese table . __eou__ you have it right . alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in china . drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in northern china . __eou__ i just felt embarrassed if i refused to drink when people toasted to me . but if i keep gulping down one cup after another , i'm afraid i would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . the right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . this will endear you __eou__ a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that i never understood . __eou__ then he must be opening his heart to the friends . in a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ i got you . next time . i'll preface a toast with a statement like ' i can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway .
our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__ really ? where did you hear that ? __eou__ i met with the supervisor just this morning . i don't know , but i am a little worried . who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__ i'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be george . he is such a kiss-ass . he'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__ no , it's not going to be george . i don't think it's andy either . he is involved with the boss's sister in-law . and you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ that's true . what about lisa ? i bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ lisa ? no way . i've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . you know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ well , okay . then there is still michael . but he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . it definitely won't be michael . __eou__ no , that would be crazy . but then who will it be ? oh dear , it must be me . i should have known it ! why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . what should i do ? i've got a family t __eou__ well , it could be me too . but i am not too worried . this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . it would almost b
the band is pretty good . how do you like the music ? __eou__ it's very nice . i haven't heard live music in a while . this is fun . __eou__ well , then , may i invite you for the next dance ? __eou__ of course . but i'm afraid i'm not much of a dancer ... __eou__ don't worry . i'm not much of a dancer myself . __eou__ you're dancing so well . __eou__ you dance beautifully too . __eou__ when did you learn to dance ? __eou__ in college . but i don't dance very often . what's your favourite dance ? __eou__ it's hard to say . it depends . but i love the waltz . __eou__ how about tango ? __eou__ oh , i like it . it's such a beautiful dance , but i can't do it well . what about you ? __eou__ tango is my favorite . anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . __eou__ thank you for the dance . __eou__ my pleasure . let's go and have a drink . __eou__ ok .
i really admire you , diana . __eou__ why , jerry ? your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ i work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ isn't there anything else ? __eou__ i have no idea . __eou__ you must have a high iq score . __eou__ well , jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ my iq score is slightly above average . __eou__ seriously ? but you are such a genius . __eou__ maybe i've got a higher eq . i'm not sure . __eou__ well , perhaps you're right . sometimes eq matters more than iq . __eou__ you can say that again , jerry . and i'm sure you're high in both of them . with a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ oh , thank you . i'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ let's go !
hi , i'm lucas , i just moved in next door . __eou__ oh , hi lucas , come on in . i'm barbara . nice to meet you . __eou__ nice to meet you too . __eou__ would you like something to drink ? i've got tea and some grape juice . __eou__ thanks . some tea would be nice . chinese tea is great . i really like your tea set . where did you get it ? __eou__ oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . but there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well . __eou__ oh yeah , i saw the tea house the other day . i think i might go and have a look sometime . it's a nice neighborhood here . __eou__ you are right about that . it's quiet and very convenient . you can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . there's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants __eou__ there's a gym nearby ? that's exciting ! i really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . i've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . __eou__ well , if you want we can go together sometime . actually i was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and i can show you the neighborhood along the way . __eou__ that would be wonderful . thanks !
what's your opinion about childless couples ? will you choose to have no kids ? __eou__ to be honest , i wouldn't . __eou__ why ? do you have to make a choice now ? __eou__ not really . but it has puzzled me for a long time . __eou__ what's the puzzle ? __eou__ my husband and i prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . __eou__ oh , i see . i think the older generation tend to think in a different way . __eou__ yes . it seems she can never accept a childless marriage . we had a fight last night . __eou__ oh , really ? maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . __eou__ but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . __eou__ definitely . __eou__ you know , i often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and i really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . __eou__ don't worry . i think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . __eou__ i guess you're right . but i still prefer to have no child . __eou__ sure . you can fully enjoy your time together .
have you ever thought about your ideal home ? __eou__ i have , actually ; i ’ ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . __eou__ what would it be like ? __eou__ well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . __eou__ how many rooms would it have ? __eou__ i ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . i ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t __eou__ how many bedrooms would your dream home have ? __eou__ i ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . __eou__ how would you decorate your house ? __eou__ i don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so i wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . i would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b __eou__ how many tvs would your dream home have ? __eou__ i think tv is a great waste of time , so i would only have one small tv in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning .
what a nice garden ! look at these tulips ! __eou__ that would be a good shot . can you take my picture here , dear ? please try to get the garden in the frame as well . __eou__ all right . would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? good . smile . say " cheese " . ok , got you . that's terrific . __eou__ thanks . could you take one more from this angle ? __eou__ no problem . __eou__ now let's have one together . __eou__ do you know how to set the timer ? __eou__ let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . __eou__ ok , let's have a try . __eou__ cheese ... __eou__ did it come out ? __eou__ yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . __eou__ never mind . let's go to the falls and try again . __eou__ ok , let's go .
finally we're on board ! __eou__ yes . it was so crowded . i'm worn-out . let's find our seats . __eou__ are they window seats or aisle seats ? __eou__ let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . __eou__ ok . but can i trade my seat with you ? i prefer the one near the window . i'm a terrible flyer . i always get airsick and can never relax until after i've landed . __eou__ that's fine . i'd like to be on the aisle anyway . it's easier to get in and out . __eou__ thanks . where shall we put our luggage ? __eou__ i think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . __eou__ good idea . __eou__ don't forget to keep the seat belt on . __eou__ ok . hope it's a pleasant trip . __eou__ yes ! __eou__ and no hijackers . __eou__ oh , you have too wild of an imagination .
is this seat taken ? __eou__ no . please sit down . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ are you also going to beijing ? __eou__ yes , on a business trip . how about you ? __eou__ i'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . have you ever been there before ? __eou__ yes , i went there once last summer . __eou__ really ? what did you think ? __eou__ i think it is amazing . you can enjoy both the traditional chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . the only thing i didn't enjoy was the subway . __eou__ was it that crowded ? __eou__ yes . there were always so many people . after taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . __eou__ oh , maybe i can take the bus or even rent a car . __eou__ that's a good idea . wish you a great vacation ! __eou__ thank you very much !
hello , ms . barkley . how are you ? __eou__ fine , thank you , sir . it ’ s nice to see you again . __eou__ good to see you again , too . how ’ s you family ? __eou__ very well , thank you , mr . parker .
hi , jim . how are you ? i haven ’ t seen you for a while . __eou__ i ’ m fine . i ’ ve been out of town . i just got back . __eou__ where were you ? __eou__ i was in new york for a wedding .
matthew ? hi ! __eou__ steve ! haven't seen you in ages ! how long's it been ? __eou__ it's got to be almost a year now . __eou__ how have you been ? __eou__ i'm pretty good . i've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i don't want to renew it . __eou__ yeah , i remember the neighborhood . have you found a place yet ? __eou__ not yet . i am still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck . __eou__ well , maybe i can help . remember my neighbor ? __eou__ mrs . thou ? __eou__ yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . i think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . __eou__ great . it's a lovely neighborhood . and it would be nice to be neighbors again . it would be just like the old days ! __eou__ i'll ask mrs . thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . has your number changed ?
what's your apartment like ? __eou__ it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . __eou__ what is it like living in on-campus housing ? __eou__ it's not as bad as i thought it would be . the freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . but , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . __eou__ did you have to pay a deposit ? __eou__ no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . __eou__ do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? __eou__ no , it's all included . besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . __eou__ how long is your contract for ? __eou__ that's the bad thing---the contract ends in june , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . __eou__ have you started looking again yet ? __eou__ not yet . i'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . __eou__ good luck !
you haven't spent much time with sophia lately . are you speaking to each other at the moment ? __eou__ no , we're not . we've been drifting apart for a while . __eou__ but you two used to do everything together . i thought you really enjoyed each other's company . __eou__ we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . __eou__ can't you hang out with them , too ? __eou__ i could , but all they ever talk about is work , so i always end up feeling left out . __eou__ maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . __eou__ i tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! she's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . __eou__ it can't be that bad . she was always a really good friend to you . __eou__ you're right . she would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . but she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . __eou__ she's probably just excited about her new job . you should give her some time . it would be a shame to lose such a good friend . __eou__ i've given her enough time . i'm over it now . __eou__ i still think you two should try to patch things up . __eou__ i think i just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways .
what was your wedding ceremony like , abigail ? __eou__ my husband and i got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . but then we had three parties to celebrate . __eou__ three parties ? that's quite a lot . that must have been expensive ! __eou__ well , since my husband and i are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . it wasn't actually that expensive . __eou__ were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? __eou__ i would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . __eou__ did your husband's family get to meet your family ? __eou__ my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t __eou__ that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ? __eou__ we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa . __eou__ you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? __eou__ not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
mary , how was your date with john ? __eou__ it's ok . it seems we have a lot in common . __eou__ oh , really . that is great news . what does he look like ? __eou__ he is tall and slim , fair-haired . __eou__ sounds like he is pretty cute . what do you think of him ? __eou__ he is a nice guy and very considerate . i was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . __eou__ oh , it's love at first sight . when will you see each other again ? __eou__ he didn't say , but he said he would call me . __eou__ maybe he is busy with his work . just wait and try not to think about it too much ! __eou__ oh , steve . stop it ! i am a bit nervous ! what if he doesn't call ? __eou__ come on , mary , you're a total catch . i bet he will call you . don't worry . __eou__ thank you , steve . you're always so encouraging . __eou__ that's what friends are for .
you are dressed to kill . you look gorgeous , alexander . __eou__ thanks . this is my power suit . i have a dinner date tonight . __eou__ how did you meet each other ? __eou__ she's a friend of amy . we met at amy's birthday party . __eou__ is this your first date ? __eou__ yes . i hope it pans out . cross your fingers , lily . __eou__ sure it will . oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . i'm going to be late for my date . __eou__ oh ... so you buried the hatchet with steven ? __eou__ absolutely not ! he's a cheater . i will never talk to him again . i'm over with him . he's history ! __eou__ then who will you meet tonight ? __eou__ a guy i met on the internet three month ago . __eou__ really ? are you sure this is a good idea ? __eou__ please don't be so fussy ! i didn't just meet him yesterday . __eou__ i know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information .
i wonder what he looks like . oh , i can't wait to see him ! his email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . __eou__ hey , isabelle ... __eou__ logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! don't tell me you're the guy ! it can't be true . __eou__ yes , i am the guy . __eou__ what a bummer ! you set me up ? __eou__ let me explain . i didn't mean to hurt you ... __eou__ how dare you ! __eou__ hang on a second . hear me out , just this once , isabella ! __eou__ why did you lie to me in the email ? __eou__ i didn't lie . you just didn't ask me my real name . __eou__ i should have known it was you . no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . i thought i might have found the one for me . __eou__ i'm sorry . it was cruel of me . but i promise it will never happen again ? look , there's a nice restaurant . let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
hey , lily , what are you doing ? __eou__ waiting for someone . __eou__ you mean the boy you met on msn ? __eou__ you're right . he is so funny and i think i'm in love with him . __eou__ you must be joking . you can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! __eou__ i know , but i keep thinking of him every day . and i get really depressed when he's not online . __eou__ i think it's just a crush . you can't be serious . __eou__ well , this might be silly . but i just can't get him off my mind . and i can't help missing him . __eou__ did you tell him ? __eou__ yes . he said i'm his dream girl . __eou__ you shouldn't take it too seriously . it might be a lie . __eou__ i know . i can't tell whether he's serious or not so i need your advice . __eou__ i think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along .
what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? __eou__ i don't think dieting is good for you . it's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! __eou__ but what do you think about people who are obese ? what should they do to lose weight ? __eou__ they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . they don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . __eou__ so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? __eou__ sure , they can eat some chocolate . as long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . __eou__ how about drinking soda ? __eou__ many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . if you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try __eou__ that's good advice . have you ever tried taking vitamins ? __eou__ my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but i don't take them anymore . vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . __eou__ how do you know so much about food and dieting ? __eou__ you might not believe this , but i used to be twice the size than i am now !
i feel absolutely horrible . my temperature is 41 degrees celsius , and i've got a headache and a runny nose . __eou__ do you have any other symptoms ? __eou__ i've also got a terrible stomach-ache . is my face still swollen ? __eou__ just a little . has your toothache gone now ? __eou__ yes , for the most part . it doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . __eou__ how about your tongue ? does it still hurt ? __eou__ no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . i think it's already healed . __eou__ how did you get that burn again ? __eou__ i scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . __eou__ you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? __eou__ no , but i'm sure i'll get better soon . __eou__ when's the last time you took your tablets ? __eou__ i took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . __eou__ i think it's time you took another does of each . what would you like to drink with them ? __eou__ just some water , please . do you have any ointment for my nose ? it feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . __eou__ sure , i'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? some soup ? __eou__ that sounds good . __eou__ soup always makes me feel better when i'm sick . i hope it makes you feel better , too .
you don't look too well . maybe you should take the day off from work . __eou__ i couldn't do that . i have an important meeting to go to today . __eou__ do you feel ok ? __eou__ not really . after a 12 - hour flight , i've got jetlag , and on top of that , i think i've also got the flu . __eou__ why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? you should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . __eou__ could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ? __eou__ you're really hot . let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down . __eou__ ok . i'll stay home this morning and rest , but if i feel better in the afternoon , i'm going to the meeting . __eou__ zach , what's that on your arm ? __eou__ i don't know . it looks a bit red , but i'm sure it's nothing . __eou__ it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! are you allergic to anything ? __eou__ just cats , but i don't think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . __eou__ i completely forgot about your cat allergy . i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . let's go . __eou__ shouldn't we make an appointment first ? __eou__ we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . __eou__ whatever you say . i just want to get to my meeting !
do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? __eou__ sure . have you got anywhere in mind ? __eou__ i'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . __eou__ that italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . do you want to go there ? __eou__ i'm not really in the mood for italian , actually . i was thinking of something a bit spicy . __eou__ if you want spicy food , then i'd recommend going to a thai , indian or chinese restaurant . how about that chinese buffet on cowley road ? __eou__ i really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . but , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . __eou__ you're right . most of their dishes have sweet sauces . we could try that indian restaurant just down the road from us . __eou__ the taj ? they're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . __eou__ the taj it is then . __eou__ shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? __eou__ they'll still charge us a corkage fee . __eou__ that's right . it'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . __eou__ don't worry about money . i'll treat you tonight . __eou__ are you sure ? we could go dutch . __eou__ no , i'll pay . it's my turn anyway . you paid last time . __eou__ i won't argue with that ! let's go !
hey ayden , i was wondering if you could do me a favor . __eou__ that depends . what is it ? __eou__ it's kind of a big favor . i'm absolutely flat broke , and i owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until friday to give it to her , but i don't get paid until next monday . do you think you could loans __eou__ i'd love to help you out , but i'm a bit short on cash this month as well . i had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . __eou__ if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . i'll pay you back on monday . i promise . __eou__ let's see , i've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . i can only spare about $ 20 . i would give you more if i had it , i just don't have much money to my name right now . __eou__ thanks a lot ayden . every little bit will help . tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . __eou__ that'd be great . thanks ! what time should i come over ? __eou__ how about at 6 pm ? __eou__ see you then !
are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? __eou__ of course . is the dinner still on ? __eou__ yes , i was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . __eou__ we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . __eou__ that's what i thought you would do . listen , i live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . it's just down the street from all the bars . you probably don't want to be walking around after dark . __eou__ it can't be that bad . __eou__ i wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . __eou__ really ? i never would have guessed . the criminals must only come out in the evenings , because i've never noticed anything strange when i've been at your house in the daytime . __eou__ do me a favor , and take a taxi . it'd make me feel a lot better . __eou__ ok , we will . how do you get around in the evenings ? __eou__ when i first moved in , i walked everywhere . but within a week , i had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! now , i always take public transportation . __eou__ has anything else happened to you ? __eou__ nothing else has happened to me , but i have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . __eou__ well , we'll be careful . thanks for letting me know .
does your family have a record of your ancestors ? __eou__ sure . my mom has been working on our family tree for years . she ’ s always updating it . __eou__ do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? i ’ d love to see it . __eou__ i can show it to you now , if you like . i think it goes back about 8 generations so far . __eou__ that ’ s amazing . do you have a large extended family ? __eou__ i ’ ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . __eou__ are you very close to your first-cousins ? __eou__ the ones that are my age are close relatives . now that i ’ m older , i don ’ t spend as much time with them as i used to , so i don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . __eou__ i see . who ’ s the head of your household ? __eou__ it ’ s definitely my mother . and , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . __eou__ that ’ s interesting . what does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? __eou__ at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . __eou__ that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . like grandmother , like grandson .
hey , teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ? __eou__ actually , i popped in them last night . __eou__ ok , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ? __eou__ well , they're really beautiful people . __eou__ i'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ? __eou__ yeah , she is a neck-off for sure . __eou__ and he looks like a typical jog . __eou__ he is a professional football player . __eou__ ah-ha , i thought so . __eou__ anyway , that is not what i meant by beautiful . __eou__ what did you mean ? __eou__ i meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to . __eou__ that's right . __eou__ yeah . i think things are worked out just fine .
have you ever seen bill gate's home on the internet ? __eou__ no . what's it like ? __eou__ it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . the house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through __eou__ would you want to live there ? __eou__ i think his house is fantastic , but i wouldn't want to live there . you would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro __eou__ what's your dreamhole like then ? __eou__ my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in england . __eou__ would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? __eou__ old homes are great because they've got character . i think that's important . __eou__ it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? because they've got character ? __eou__ no , that's just because i don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! __eou__ i see . if you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? __eou__ no , i'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . i love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a
hey , vernassa . why be angry look ? __eou__ it's the new neighbor . i hate her guts . __eou__ i've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? __eou__ she made another white crack about my clothes . __eou__ are you sure she was trying to put you down ? __eou__ of course , i am sure . __eou__ you shall go easy on her . she is new here . __eou__ just how am i supposed to do that ? __eou__ you shall just take it in surprise . __eou__ i've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons . __eou__ try to pull it together , vernassa . i am sure things will turn note , ok ? __eou__ i am not . she is no picnic . __eou__ well . if you think i can help , let me know . __eou__ thanks , serena .
how many people are there in your family ? __eou__ there are 15 people in my family . __eou__ what did you say ? how many ? __eou__ 15 people . __eou__ wow . that is a very big family . do you all live together ? __eou__ of course we do ! my father's parents , mum , dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me . __eou__ but you don't live at home anymore . __eou__ right , but that's where my heart is . but you're right , now there are only 14 living at home . __eou__ my goodness ! your family must live in a huge house . __eou__ yes . my family lives in rural korea , near pusan . we have a huge house.the first floor of the house is a part-time private school.in the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , englis __eou__ wow ! you grew up in a school ! no wonder your english is excellent ! __eou__ my aunts and uncles are all teachers . __eou__ you are so lucky ! __eou__ i guess so . while growing up , i read hundreds of interesting english storybooks every year . __eou__ that's what i did in america . i was reading all the time . i was never a big tv watcher . tv wastes time . __eou__ i agree . reading for fun is why all the english students at our family school have excellent english . all the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying english . __eou__ 800 books ? i'm impressed ! __eou__ my aunts studied in the american universities.they say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your english.that ' s what they learn here in america .
hey , the new soho . how's everything going ? __eou__ everything's great . i've just returned from my office . __eou__ your office ? aren't you a freelancer ? __eou__ sure i am . i work for myself , but i've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . __eou__ a virtual office ? __eou__ yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . i pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . __eou__ what kind of services do they offer ? __eou__ a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . __eou__ sounds fun.what else ? __eou__ i get a business address at an expensive location , and i can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . __eou__ oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . __eou__ you bet it !

i don't know why people are just mad about david peckham . is there really anything so fascinating with him ? __eou__ he appeals to the fans thanks to two things __eou__ you mean he plays well ? yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . but a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . __eou__ certainly not . what really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . however , a few free k __eou__ in the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . after all , the majority of his fans are girls . __eou__ yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . as a man of medium height in the west , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . __eou__ and he is english ! he makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical british accent .
guess who i saw yesterday ? __eou__ i don't know . who ? __eou__ avril lavigen ! __eou__ the canadian rock singer ? but i heard you had a part-time job yesterday . how did you see her ? __eou__ yeah , i worked as temporary staff in her concert . look , her poster , a cd ... __eou__ so you're a big fan , eh ? __eou__ not really . but i like some of her songs . she's actually very talented . she's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . __eou__ and she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__ yes , though i don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__ what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__ she looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__ did you take a photo with her ? __eou__ no , there were too many people . when she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . __eou__ crazy !
good evening , john . __eou__ good evening , mary . __eou__ how are you doing ? __eou__ i'm doing fine , thanks.what ' s new with you ? __eou__ nothing special . __eou__ i'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ? __eou__ sounds good.sorry , here comes my bus.you call me , or i'll call you to make a date . __eou__ i'll call you . __eou__ all right.gotta go , bye , keep in touch . __eou__ have a great day , take care , bye .
julie , what's on the tube ? __eou__ nothing but bench of commercials . these days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__ yeah . maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? let's see if there's a game on . __eou__ okay . nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between brazil and spain . __eou__ it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . keep surfing . __eou__ alright . hmm , this movie is a rerun ... i don't know how many times i've seen this show ... commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__ oh , what is it ? __eou__ it's a total rip-off of an american reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__ oh , i know this kind of shows . sometimes they really piss me off . if i wanted reality , i'd go outside . __eou__ yeah ... it seems what we have on tv now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . there's really nothing to watch . __eou__ i don't get it . we have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! maybe we should just turn off the tv , get outside , and do something real . __eou__ cool .
have you adapted to the lifestyle in china ? __eou__ yeah , almost . but there is one thing . __eou__ what ? __eou__ i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i don't mean to say that there's no privacy in china , but ... __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ some of my chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__ that makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__ yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__ perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__ i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding . __eou__ well , that's not rare . i've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__ just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ oh , i'm shocked .
hey , jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the tv all day . anything interesting on tv ? __eou__ not really . quite boring right now , actually . mostly infomercials and public service announcements . __eou__ why don't you turn off the tv and get outside ? you need to get some fresh air . __eou__ i know , i know.but my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . it's the series finals , and i wouldn't miss it for the world ! __eou__ really ? what's the series about ? __eou__ well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america . it's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . i think you'd like it . __eou__ it sounds interesting , but i am not a big fan of tv shows . they're time consuming and don't have much depth . __eou__ i believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . take this show for example , it examines american xenophobia and how it might conflict with the american dream , with hilarious results . __eou__ really ? that's interesting ! __eou__ yeah.oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . it should be good . __eou__ ok , i'll give it a go .
have you ever been invited to a chinese feast ? __eou__ sure . beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . __eou__ as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? __eou__ to begin with , i have to use chopsticks . __eou__ but you look quite proficient in using them now . __eou__ certainly . after all , i've been here for two years . it's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch __eou__ yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm i __eou__ anything strang about that ? __eou__ maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . __eou__ oh , sorry ! there's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .
i heard that ben is forming his own band . __eou__ it will be a rock and roll band probably . he ’ s a very good guitarist . __eou__ can you play a musical instrument ? if you can , he might ask you to join the band . __eou__ i can play drums , but i haven ’ t played for a while . i ’ m not sure i ’ d be good enough to play in a band . __eou__ i wish i could play a musical instrument . i love music . __eou__ nowadays , you can be a dj . you can mix dance music . you don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing . __eou__ i'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice . __eou__ you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . you already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . __eou__ that ’ s a great idea . i ’ ll search for some information on the internet . if it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it .
i heard you received a prize for you book . __eou__ yes , i did . i won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . __eou__ congratulations ! you must be very proud of your achievement . __eou__ actually , i was happy just to get the book published . winning the prize was an added bonus . __eou__ what was the prize ? __eou__ i won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . __eou__ that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! have you ever won a prize before ? __eou__ i shared a prize with some friends last week . we won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . __eou__ i won $ 10 in the lottery last month . perhaps next time , i ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot !
what kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ i like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . you know , i go to a disco almost every week . sometimes it ’ s too loud though . you prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , i do . i find it very relaxing . i often listen to mozart or bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ i must admit that i like several pieces of classical music . it ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . research suggest that it makes your brain more active . students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ really ? perhaps i should listen to classical music often . i heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ yes . that ’ s why i listen to it in the evenings . i usually play it as background music while i ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ i ’ ve got a few classical music cd ’ s . i should follow your lead and increase my brain power . __eou__ you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . you can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . you should do the same with some music . you might find something you like . classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ that ’ s true . there ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character .
do you like animals ? i really like dogs . __eou__ so do i . i don ’ t like cats . __eou__ why ? i think cats are ok . __eou__ i can ’ t bear being near cats . they don ’ t seem to like me either . __eou__ i like wild animals . i don ’ t like spiders and snakes . i think spiders and snakes are disgusting . __eou__ i ’ m fond of snakes . i think they ’ re great . i agree with you about spiders though . i think spiders are horrible . i think it ’ s because they have so many legs . __eou__ i think bears are wonderful . pandas are fantastic . i low the people who kill them for their fur . __eou__ i agree . i ’ m carry about mice . i think they ’ re so cute ! __eou__ really ? i don ’ t see the attraction . i ’ m afraid of mice .
are you good at making decisions ? __eou__ not really . sometimes , i even let other people make key decision for me . __eou__ what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ? __eou__ there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . i can never seem to choose . i let my parents make big decisions for me . they chose my university and my course . i ended up studying something __eou__ your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? start with some basic ones . when your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . you ’ re very decisive , i ’ ve noticed . so , which bar are we going to this evening ? __eou__ i can ’ t make a decision . you ’ ll have to put forward an idea . __eou__ ok , i choose luckies . __eou__ you see ? you ’ re becoming more decisive already !
i find it really hard to express myself in class . i have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . __eou__ let me give you a little advice . you know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . __eou__ i often do , but i ’ m worried about the responses from other people . __eou__ you have to be realistic . not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . __eou__ i ’ m worried that what i say will not make sense . __eou__ we could chat about the topic before class . i could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ? __eou__ that ’ s easy . express possibilities . people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . __eou__ i didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . __eou__ the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . they will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how .
i ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend . __eou__ i hope that i can finally find free time too . i ’ ve been so busy at work recently . __eou__ how might you spend the weekend . __eou__ i hope to do a little gardening . i find it very relaxing . __eou__ i might do that too . i hope the weather is nice . i could go and play some golf . __eou__ i heard that the weather should be good . there ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely . __eou__ hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends . __eou__ of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true . __eou__ unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention .
i heard that janet has got a new job . she ’ s working for the united investment group . i hear that they pay very well . __eou__ i heard that too . she must be making a pocket . well , good for her . __eou__ now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . __eou__ yes , she will . at the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . __eou__ you ’ re right . by the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? __eou__ really ? i thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__ they did . he inherited the money form an uncle . i hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__ dying can be very expensive nowadays ! what ’ s he going to do with it ? __eou__ he said that he would probably invest most of it . he ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . he just wants some extra money available for when he retires . __eou__ i had some good financial news yesterday too . __eou__ really ? have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__ no , but i got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work i ’ ve put in recently . i think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . __eou__ it certainly was ! so , what are you going to do with your windfall ?
how are the children doing at sport ? __eou__ i ’ m very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that ’ s very fast for a kid his age . __eou__ he ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? __eou__ he ’ s not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again , that ’ s fine for someone hi __eou__ two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long-distance running ? __eou__ the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . __eou__ how are they at swimming ? __eou__ they ’ re ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . __eou__ kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . __eou__ i ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! __eou__ i think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . __eou__ it seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further .
how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ ve retired ? __eou__ well , i nearly always get up at dawn . i don ’ t like sleeping in late . the days are longer in summer that in winter , so i get up in summer . i usually do some exercise when i get up . __eou__ what do you have for breakfast ? __eou__ i usually have cereal , but sometimes i cook a traditional english breakfast . __eou__ that sounds nice . how do you spend your mornings ? __eou__ i usually do housework in mornings . i go shopping occasionally . i like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . i always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . it takes about __eou__ how do you spend your afternoons ? __eou__ i usually meet some friends and we play sports together or i might spend some time alone on my hobbies . i spend winter evening watching tv , but i spend summer evening at cultural events if i have time
i watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . it was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . __eou__ really ? tell me about some of the plants they showed . __eou__ well . there was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . __eou__ is that type of plant found in this country ? __eou__ no , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because i ’ d like to see it in action . __eou__ so would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? __eou__ they showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . the insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . other insects cannot get it . of course , when the insect molle __eou__ that ’ s very specialized . so , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . if one became extinct , the other would too . __eou__ that ’ s right . that ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . __eou__ i see . the plants that fascinate me most are cacti . i find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . __eou__ according to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . __eou__ that ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss .
which sports are popular in your country ? __eou__ most people like football . more boys like football than girls . a few girls play it really well . some people like playing basketball . __eou__ do many people like tennis ? __eou__ more and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . __eou__ in my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . a few people like extreme sports , but i think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . __eou__ extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . no one i know plays golf . __eou__ i know loads of people who play it regularly . there are plenty of golf courses around the country . in the past , only a tiny number of people played . __eou__ a great deal of people follow rugby in my country . __eou__ there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .
do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? __eou__ it could be . there are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . __eou__ it seems that the climate in this country is changing . __eou__ the summers are hotter . the last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . there have also been stronger winds . __eou__ i think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . __eou__ i think you ’ re right . climate change naturally over time , but i think that human activities are speeding up the change . i wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . __eou__ me too . if we don ’ t do something soon , it might be too late .
are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? __eou__ there are a few stories about natural disasters . there is a massive forest fire in australia . it covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . __eou__ was it caused accidentally or naturally ? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa . __eou__ nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . the drought in africa is causing starvation . millions of people have migrated to try and find food . __eou__ what is the international community doing to help ? __eou__ the european union has sent several plants with relief supplies . several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . refugee camps have been set up across the region . __eou__ how many countries have been affected ? __eou__ six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . __eou__ i saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran . __eou__ yes . there have been a few there recently . they say that this one was not a big quake . the iranians are dealing with it on their own . they have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u __eou__ does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? __eou__ so far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital .
i went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . __eou__ yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue . __eou__ so did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs . __eou__ i know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon . __eou__ we really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . __eou__ if it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either . __eou__ i guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . __eou__ the weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable .
is the environment a big issues in your country ? it is in mine . __eou__ it is in mine too.the biggest issue is water . the climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__ what methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__ water is rationed . we can only use a certain amount each month . it means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . they use too much water . __eou__ i see . i think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ yes , i agree . the air here is much more polluted than in my country . of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ we have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ the problem is now on a truly global scale . i don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ i think you ’ re right . there needs to be an international response to this problem .
what do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? __eou__ i think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . when we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . __eou__ perhaps people should stop eating animals . we could grow more crops . __eou__ what would you do with all the animals ? you couldn ’ t just let them go . besides , some people would still hunt them . meat has become an integral part of our diet . __eou__ we could provide them with better conditions anyway . we should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . we should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . __eou__ that ’ s true . i think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . i think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . __eou__ i agree . i ’ m an adult and i love going to the zoo . i don ’ t like animals experiments though . i believe that we can do tests in other ways . __eou__ i read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . __eou__ that ’ s good news . the good thing is that most people treat their pets well . __eou__ sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . __eou__ have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . __eou__ yes , i have . they do an excellent job .
what are the seasons like in your city ? __eou__ summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . i love the summers in my city , but i hate the wintertime . __eou__ does it ever rain in summer ? __eou__ we usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . __eou__ what are spring and autumn like ? __eou__ i like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . in spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . it ’ s usually windy with some rain . autumn is usually sunny an __eou__ well , i live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . we get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . in winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine __eou__ do you usually go on a summer holiday ? __eou__ no , i don ’ t . i go on a winter holiday instead . i go somewhere warm . __eou__ i usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . i try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city .
there are so many environment problems in the world today . do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? __eou__ i hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but i doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . __eou__ we need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . there ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . developing countries __eou__ everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . it ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . countries and companies just want the wood . they ’ re not thinking a __eou__ in other parts of the world , especially in africa , there is a problem with desertification . climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . in means that people cannot grow e __eou__ it also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . __eou__ have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? you could get involved with projects to improve the environment . __eou__ i think i ’ d like to do that . i could take the things i learn here back to my country when i have finished my studies .
what do you do in summer ? __eou__ i love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . i love being out in the fresh summer air . how about you ? __eou__ i don ’ t often go for walks , but i either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . __eou__ what do you do in winter ? __eou__ well , i play sports indoors quite often . if i ’ m feeling lazy , i just watch a film at home . i prefer summer to winter . __eou__ i think most people do . i like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . it ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . __eou__ yes . i like wearing shorts in summer . my legs would freeze ! __eou__ do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? __eou__ thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever !
i was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . it was very interesting . __eou__ i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . __eou__ the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . __eou__ horses are useful to people too . we use them for sports and recreation . __eou__ don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . __eou__ can you ride a horse ? __eou__ yes , i can . i don ’ t ride regularly though . how about you ? __eou__ i can ride too . perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? __eou__ what a good idea !
what's the weather like in your city ? __eou__ in the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier . __eou__ the summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city.the rain falls mostly in the winter.and we often get snow . __eou__ what are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . __eou__ in winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . __eou__ yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? __eou__ we do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ? __eou__ yes , they are . like i said we have thunderstorms.but each one usually only last a few hours.then the skys are clear again . __eou__ have you ever had snow in your city ? __eou__ my grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child.but my parents and i only see it outside of our city . __eou__ the river in my city sometime freeze over.people go ice-skating on it.on summer people go boating on the river.but few people go swimming because it is not very clean . __eou__ as you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny .
both our countries are quite small . how would you describe the landscape in your country ? __eou__ my country is well know for being very flat . there are some hills in the southeast of the country . __eou__ is it really completely flat ? __eou__ pretty much . the land rises and falls only a few meters . the southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . there are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . __eou__ yes , there are . they are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . __eou__ the coast of your country is very varied . the coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . __eou__ that doesn ’ t sound too bad . great for sunbathing ! the coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . there are cliffs , then sandy beaches . then rocks . there are lots of caves in the cliffs . __eou__ there are many lakes and rivers in your country too . we also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . __eou__ we also have waterfalls in the mountains . they make the landscapes look very scenic . the landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water .
is there a lot of crime in your city ? __eou__ there ’ s some , but i don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . a lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . there ’ s very little major crime . __eou__ it ’ s the same in my city . we also have a lot of drug addicts . a lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . __eou__ that happens in many places . in my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . the police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but i don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for __eou__ some people believe that a tough approach is better . other prefer a more lenient approach . __eou__ i think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . if most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . __eou__ that ’ s possible , but i ’ m not sure it would really happen like that .
which countries have you been to ? __eou__ i ’ ve been to most of the countries in europe , several countries in asia-china , japan , korea , and thailand-and to the united states and canada . __eou__ i thought you had been to australia too . __eou__ no , but i ’ m planning on visiting australia and new zealand soon . i ’ ve heard that they are beautiful countries . which is the most beautiful country you ’ ve been to ? __eou__ i think i ‘ d say norway . it has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . __eou__ isn ’ t it really cold there ? __eou__ well , the north of norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . it ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . __eou__ i ’ ve been to other scandinavian countries , but not to norway . perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there .
when in rome , do as the romans do , they say . __eou__ what do the romans do ? __eou__ they live in rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . but sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . __eou__ in other words , the romans do what everyone else does . __eou__ yes , but they do it differently . everything is different . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ well , the climate's different for a start . it doesn't rain so much as it does in england . the sun shines more often . __eou__ i envy them the sun . __eou__ i know . you hate the rain , don't you ? __eou__ i certainly do . __eou__ and a roman really ioves life . eye knows how to enjoy himself . __eou__ they always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ? __eou__ not always . but they like a good meal . lots of tourists go to rome just for the food , you know . __eou__ really ? how much does it cost to fly to rome ? __eou__ i don't know exactly , but it costs a lot of money .
hello , jim . where are you going ? __eou__ to the cinema . what about coming with me ? __eou__ no , thanks . i'm going home . my wife's expecting me . __eou__ what a pity . i believe it's a very good film . __eou__ do you go to the cinema a lot ? __eou__ once a week . most nights i sit at home and watch telly __eou__ do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? __eou__ no , i'm sorry i don't . i never read the papers till i get home . __eou__ oh , i see . by the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? __eou__ i don't know yet . my wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . she livesay the sea , you know . __eou__ oh , does she ? that's convenient . __eou__ yes , but i want to go to the country . __eou__ don't you like the sea ? __eou__ yes , very much . but i need peace and quiet when i'm on holiday . what are coughing to do ? __eou__ i'm going to stay at home . __eou__ aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ? __eou__ no , i want to buy a car , and that's going to take every penny i've got .
let's play chess . __eou__ i haven't played chess for a long time . __eou__ that's all right , i'm a beginner . i've just learnt how to play . __eou__ look , there's a chessboard . those two men have already finished playing . __eou__ you're a very good player __eou__ not really , but once i won a prize . __eou__ so did i . i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . __eou__ my prize was for the best player in the country . now let's start playing chess seriously .
what was the party like last night , jean ? __eou__ not bad at all , thanks . there were one or two interesting people there.why couldn't you come ? __eou__ well , i couldn't get away from work early . and when . i got home i had a headache , so i had to go straight to bed . but i was over-tired , because i wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . __eou__ what a shame . why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? __eou__ i don't like them . i used to take them when i had to work overtime , you know . __eou__ how many did you use to take ? __eou__ three every night . __eou__ good heavens . why did you take so many ? __eou__ because i was under a terrible strain . the doctor saidthey weren't very strong . anyway , i used to feel awful the next morning . __eou__ i'm sure you did . __eou__ the doctor said i had to be careful . __eou__ he was quite right . __eou__ so i stopped drinking coffee late at night instead .
wake up sleepyhead.the sun is beginning to shine . what a lovely summer day ! __eou__ yeah , clearly blue sky.but it is a bit too hot for me . i don't like heat and humidity . __eou__ it's not that hot . it's cooler than yesterday . let's go swimming ! __eou__ that's a thought . it's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . if we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . __eou__ yeah , sounds like fun . i can wear my new pink bikini . __eou__ there won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . __eou__ who cares ! well , the smart guys get there early . that's the kind of guy i want to meet . let's go ! __eou__ if you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then i want to wear one , too . __eou__ ok , you could borrow one of mine . __eou__ thanks , how about the green and black one ? __eou__ no problem . here it is .
when was america discovered , tony ? __eou__ i'm not certain . do you know ? __eou__ america was discovered by christopher columbus in 1492 . __eou__ in a way that's right . but the vikings travelled there long beforecolumbus . and what about the red indians ? __eou__ all right . ask me a question now . __eou__ who invented the electric light bulb ? __eou__ that's easy . it was invented by edison . __eou__ correct . now for a harder question . who will be the first men on mars ? __eou__ i can't answer that . but i think mars will be visited by men before theed of this century . __eou__ ask me a question now . __eou__ all right . what is the nearest planet to the sun ? __eou__ that's easy . it's .. er . venus . no . pluto . no . wait a minute . it's anthe tip of my tongue . oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?

where are you going for your holidays , charles ? __eou__ to australia . i'm going to visit my uncle in brisbane for three weeks . __eou__ good gracious ! you certainly are lucky . how are you going there ? __eou__ by air , of course . it takes over two weeks to go by sea . __eou__ i once went to singapore by air . it was very exciting-but never again . __eou__ why ? did you feel frightened ? __eou__ for a short time . one of the engines caught fire . __eou__ what did the pilot do ? __eou__ he put it out and flew back to the airport . then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was . __eou__ did you land safely ? __eou__ yes , we did . but i shall never fly again .
we've got a new manager in our department . __eou__ oh ? you hoped to get that job , didn't you ? __eou__ yes , i did . __eou__ i'm sorry . that's too bad . who is it ? who got the job , i mean ? __eou__ someone called drexler . carl drexler . he's been with the company onlytwo years . i've been here longer . and i know more about the job , too __eou__ hmm . why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? __eou__ because i'm the wrong sex , of course ! __eou__ you mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? __eou__ yes , that was probably it ! it isn't fair . __eou__ what sort of clothes does he wear ? __eou__ a dark suit . white shirt . a tie . why ? __eou__ perhaps that had something to do with it . __eou__ you mean you think i didn't get the job because i come to work in jeansand a sweater ? __eou__ it's possible , isn't it ? __eou__ do you really think i should wear different clothes ? __eou__ well . . . perhaps you should think about it . __eou__ why should i wear a skirt ? or a dress ? __eou__ i'm not saying you should . i'm saying you should think about it . that's all ! __eou__ why should i do that ? i'm good at my job ! that's the only important thing ! __eou__ hmm . perhaps it should be the only important thing . but it isn't . not in this company .
do you believe in ufo's ? __eou__ sure . a ufo is just a space vehicle from another planet . if you think about it , our space shuttles are ufos . __eou__ i've never thought about it like that before . __eou__ i've seen photos of ufos in america before , but they've all looked doctored up . __eou__ do you think that there's life on other planets ? __eou__ i think there must be . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ i don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . the world is just far too big for that . __eou__ do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? __eou__ no , but we're trying to contact them . __eou__ i suppose you're right . __eou__ i think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . __eou__ do you really think that global warming wil destroy earth some day ? __eou__ there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but i don't think it's going to happen any time soon .

i can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! are you trying to lose your job ? __eou__ of course not . i'm just observing casual day . on fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . __eou__ wow ! nobody told me about that . won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? __eou__ we don't think so . casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . __eou__ i guess it lets people express their individual tastes . but won't some people abuse it ? __eou__ not really . besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . people can't just wear whatever they want . __eou__ it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . __eou__ believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . employees are actually more productive on casual days .

what's your favorite magazine ? __eou__ off hand , i'd say the reader's digests is my favorite . __eou__ what kind of magazine is it ? __eou__ it's instructive and inspiring . __eou__ really ? it is a weekly , isn't it ? __eou__ no , it's a semimonthly . __eou__ does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? __eou__ yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . __eou__ oh , i think i should try to read one .
hey , mark , long time no see . __eou__ julie ! it's good to see you again . how have you been ? __eou__ great . i just got back from a week's vacation in thailand . __eou__ really ? how was it ? __eou__ fantastic ! i didn't want to come back . __eou__ i hear the beaches in thailand are beautiful . __eou__ they are . and not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . __eou__ i do like thai food . did you see much of bangkok ? __eou__ not much . i've go enough city life in beijing . __eou__ i know what you mean . i could use a vacation myself . __eou__ hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to thailand together sometime ? __eou__ yeah , it sure would .
hello , john . how are you ? __eou__ i'm fine , thanks . and you ? __eou__ very well , thanks . nice to see you again . i haven't seen you for a long time . what have you been doing lately ? __eou__ oh , nothing much really . and how is everything with you ? __eou__ fine , thanks . i've been busy lately . __eou__ what have you been doing ? __eou__ i've been studying for my exams . my school exams will begin next month . __eou__ really ? good luck for them . __eou__ thanks . and how are your parents ? __eou__ they're both very well , thanks . __eou__ where are you going now ? __eou__ i'm going to do some shopping . why don't you come with me ? __eou__ i can't . i have to meet someone . __eou__ it's been nice talking to you . __eou__ good-bye . see you again sometime .
i heard that kevin got divorced . is that true ? __eou__ not so bad , but kevin does have problems with his wife . __eou__ what ? __eou__ his wife always complained that kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . __eou__ poor kevin , we should do something for him . he is a nice guy and does his job well . __eou__ yeah , i agree with you . but you know , it's just one of those things .
happy birthday , jim ! __eou__ thank you , lisa . __eou__ here is a present for you . i hope you like it . __eou__ oh , great ! i love it ! you know i've been expecting this for a long time . __eou__ i'm very glad to hear that . __eou__ come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
what's the weather forecast for today ? __eou__ cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . __eou__ any rain ? __eou__ no , but i wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . __eou__ i wouldn't either . it's been looking like rain for several days .
happy mother ’ s day , mom ! __eou__ thanks ! these are beautiful . you shouldn ’ t have ! __eou__ of course i should have ! you certainly deserve them ! you put up with all of us . __eou__ i forgot what i put up with in that case . i do deserve these flowers .
did you order the cake ? __eou__ oh , i forgot . __eou__ get on the phone right now . it might not be too late . __eou__ i ’ m so sorry ! ok , so you just want a simple message on it . __eou__ yeah . how about “ happy birthday tony , from the gang . ” __eou__ i ’ m on it !
what are you and corey doing for valentine ’ s day this friday ? __eou__ probably nothing . __eou__ you have to do something romantic . __eou__ romantic ? i can ’ t remember what that word means . __eou__ well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! __eou__ ha , ha ! those days are long gone .
what are you doing ? __eou__ i'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . whenever i get the time , i like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . __eou__ you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? __eou__ i guess you could say that . what kind of games do you like ? __eou__ i guess the games i like the most are the ones that i'm good at ! __eou__ doesn't everyone ? which games are those ? __eou__ well , i like to play darts . whenever i go to a bar , i usually play for a few hours . __eou__ did you play a lot of games when you were little ? __eou__ my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . we used to have family tournaments every weekend . __eou__ do you still like playing those games ? __eou__ not at all . i never really did , to be honest . what about you ? did your family used to play games together ? __eou__ everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . __eou__ some of my friends play cards on the internet . have you ever tried that ? __eou__ no , i prefer to play with people i know . __eou__ how about mah-jong ? __eou__ it's a popular game with some people , but i've never played it . __eou__ i thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! __eou__ i hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same !
so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ? __eou__ to be honest , i don't really care for either one . __eou__ i thought everyone liked basketball . why don't you like it ? __eou__ i used to play basketball when i was little , and i never scored a goal . every time i watch a basketball game , i think about how horrible i was at it . __eou__ that makes sense . __eou__ how about you ? what's your favorite sport of all time ? __eou__ my absolute favorite is ice hockey . __eou__ have you ever seen a live game ? __eou__ sure , many times . it's an exciting game for spectators to watch . __eou__ i've never really understood the game . __eou__ it's not that difficult . if you want to watch a game with me , i can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching . __eou__ thanks , that'd be nice . when's the next ice hockey game on ? __eou__ not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so i can explain the game to you . __eou__ that's a good idea . __eou__ let's watch the canadian team . they have a good manager and a great coach .
what did you do last night ? __eou__ i just stayed at home and watched tv . __eou__ did you watch the barcelona versus madrid game ? __eou__ yes , it was a very evenly matched game . __eou__ what were the results of the game ? __eou__ it ended in a tie . __eou__ what was the actual score ? __eou__ it was three all . __eou__ really ? i thought barcelona was going to win . they are a much better team than madrid . __eou__ if barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . __eou__ that explains it . __eou__ how many more games are left this season ? __eou__ that was the last game before the playoffs . __eou__ when do the playoffs start ? __eou__ in a few weeks . are you planning on watching them ? __eou__ of course ! i really love watching football games on tv . __eou__ me , too ! do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? i'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . __eou__ sure , that would be great . __eou__ ok , it's a date then !
congratulations on the new house ! __eou__ thanks ! we love it . __eou__ well , you guys work hard for it . it ’ s really beautiful . __eou__ i ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it !
do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ? __eou__ yes , i was in my apartment in beijing . where were you ? __eou__ i was at home with my parents in new york city . __eou__ really ? did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? __eou__ i didn't see the crash itself , but i did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . __eou__ that must have been horrible . did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? __eou__ no , we decided to stay in our apartment . with all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . it was utter chaos . __eou__ did you know anyone who worked in the world trade center ? __eou__ yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers . __eou__ did he survive ? __eou__ unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . he ended up dying in the tower . __eou__ i'm sorry . that must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family . __eou__ it was . the hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . __eou__ terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life .
have you read the feature article about oprah winfrey in this magazine ? __eou__ no , what's it about ? __eou__ apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . __eou__ she's very generous with her money . i think that's because she was poor when she was young . __eou__ i heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . __eou__ i'd believe it . she owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . __eou__ you know ; i heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in africa . __eou__ did they mention that in the article ? __eou__ yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . __eou__ that's really commendable . i think more celebrities should use their money to help people like oprah has . __eou__ i agree . so many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . __eou__ it's amazing how much money they can spend . i heard britney spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! __eou__ what a waste . it's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols .
did you watch the oscars on sunday night ? __eou__ no , but i heard about that angelina jolie and brad pitt didn't attend . __eou__ yes , that was surprising . i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . __eou__ they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood . __eou__ they're also one of the richest couples . they have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want . __eou__ i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars . __eou__ did either one of them win an oscar this year ? __eou__ i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but i don't think he won anything . __eou__ tom cruise may be handsome , but i think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? __eou__ yes , his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous . __eou__ i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . __eou__ people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i don't know why they have to make it so complicated . __eou__ i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . __eou__ that's true . i guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . __eou__ thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! __eou__ being famous , i can do without , but i wouldn't mind being rich .
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! the pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! __eou__ exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . __eou__ on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . __eou__ as much as i love this city , i think i'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . __eou__ i know what you mean . however , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . if it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse __eou__ what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? __eou__ it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . __eou__ i see , so it's similar to global warming ? __eou__ they're related to one another , yes . __eou__ i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . __eou__ people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . they've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . __eou__ people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . __eou__ i think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ? __eou__ i never really give them money because i don't want to contribute to their addictions . __eou__ homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . do you do anything to help them ? __eou__ i usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . i figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry . __eou__ that's a good idea . do they usually accept the food ? __eou__ almost always . however , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash . __eou__ it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in london now . __eou__ the cost of living in london is just too high for most people . __eou__ it's true . the economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . __eou__ did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ? __eou__ there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . if only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble . __eou__ added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . __eou__ something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . __eou__ politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . they like to focus on making life easier for the upper class . __eou__ i can only hope that one day they will change .
what happened ? why didn't he win ? __eou__ didn't you hear ? he was disqualified . __eou__ how did that happen ? he's so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! __eou__ if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . __eou__ what ? what kind of drugs was he using ? __eou__ he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . __eou__ i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . __eou__ they are . the reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . __eou__ that's so disappointing . i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . __eou__ i don't think it's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! __eou__ regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . __eou__ i agree . hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . __eou__ let's hope so .
what are you watching on the telly ? __eou__ there's a great sitcom on channel 3 that stars in about three minutes . __eou__ which one is that ? __eou__ the office . have you watched it ? __eou__ i've seen the british version and loved it , but have never seen the american version . __eou__ it's almost exactly the same . i think it's a hilarious show . __eou__ what are you watching now ? __eou__ they're just showing highlights of american idol from last night right now . __eou__ i can't stand american idol ! i think it's really over-rated . __eou__ i couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ have you got satellite , cable , or digital tv ? __eou__ we have digital tv . it's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that i'd want to watch ! __eou__ do you watch a lot of tv then ? __eou__ i guess so . i'm bit of a couch potato . how about you ? __eou__ i don't have a tv at home , so i rarely watch anything . is there anything worth watching after the office ? __eou__ there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that i'd like to watch . do you want to stay and watch it with me ? __eou__ why not ? i don't have anything better to do !
so , are you enjoying the performance so far ? __eou__ well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . what do you think ? __eou__ i think you're being a little critical . the actor in the lead role is fantastic . i suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . __eou__ do you know anyone in the play ? __eou__ actually , the woman playing ophelia is a past classmate of mine . __eou__ really ? is that why you wanted to come to the play ? __eou__ that's only part of it . i absolutely adore this director . every play he works on turns out great . __eou__ so you've seen other plays that he's directed ? __eou__ quite a few actually . by the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . my friend has invited us . do you want to go ? __eou__ sure , i'd love to meet the cast ! have you ever been in a play ? __eou__ i've never had a part in a play before , but i used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . __eou__ what did you do ? __eou__ i helped build the sets and find props for the plays . what about you ? __eou__ i once helped out with costumes , but i didn't enjoy it very much . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ i spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . __eou__ that sounds kind of boring . oh , look . they're dimming the lights . i think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play .
have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ yes , i experienced one when i was in tokyo once . the tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . __eou__ do you know where it measured on the richter scale ? __eou__ i don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . have you ever been in an earthquake ? __eou__ no , but i was in quite a few tornados when i was younger . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ i'm from the plains of the midwest . it's a prime location for tornadoes . __eou__ did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? __eou__ most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . __eou__ wow , that must have really been scary . __eou__ actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . __eou__ have you ever experiences a flood ? __eou__ no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . it actually happened the day after he bought the car ! __eou__ that sure didn't last long !
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the usa ? __eou__ why ? i thought americans were supposed to be more open than that . __eou__ well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__ do you think most people in america believe that abortion is wrong ? __eou__ no , i think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . __eou__ it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america . __eou__ religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__ what do you think about abortion ? __eou__ i personally would never want to have one , but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . __eou__ do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? __eou__ i know this is going to sound sexist , but i don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . __eou__ why not ? it's their children , too . __eou__ that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . __eou__ that might be true , but i think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
guess what ! i know something you don't know ! __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ how many planets are there in the solar system ? __eou__ that's easy . everyone knows that there are nice . __eou__ not anymore ! can you believe it ? they've decided that pluto is not a planet anymore ! __eou__ nice try . i wasn't born yesterday , you know . __eou__ i'm dead serious . they've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . __eou__ that sounds crazy . they can't just change their mind about things like that . __eou__ yes , they can . if you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . __eou__ i suppose you're right . they also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . __eou__ we actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . __eou__ do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? __eou__ i suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . __eou__ do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? __eou__ i hope not . i think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on earth . __eou__ you're so old-fashioned . that's what people used to think about people from another country ! __eou__ point taken . hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society .
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? __eou__ while i think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but i don't really care for the advertisement . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! __eou__ it's a pun . they use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . __eou__ i know , but i think it's not really appropriate for young children . __eou__ i think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . __eou__ all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . __eou__ perhaps you're right , , though . maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . __eou__ i have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but i don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . __eou__ that's a good point . i think i was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that i didn't think about how children might understand the ad . __eou__ you have to give them credit , though . it's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
have you seen the new cosmo magazine that i was reading this morning ? __eou__ i think i may have seen it on the kitchen table . __eou__ you're right , thanks . there's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that i want to finish . __eou__ who's the director ? __eou__ it's martin scorsese . you liked his film , the departed , didn't you ? __eou__ yes , it was fantastic ! can i read the article when you're finished ? __eou__ sure . you know it has an online edition , too . you should go online to read if you want to read it now . __eou__ that's ok . i'll wait until you're finished . just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? __eou__ no . i don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . __eou__ how much does the magadize cost ? __eou__ it's almost three pounds now , and i think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . __eou__ that's quite expensive . who is their target audience ? __eou__ cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . __eou__ i bet you'll still buy it , though . you wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !
guess what ? i've got great news ! __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ well , you know how i've been working at the economist as a proof-reader , right ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ well , the editor-in-chief heard that i had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if i was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . __eou__ really ? that's fantastic ! will you get a chance to do any writing ? __eou__ she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that i could be in charge of the column until she came back . __eou__ wow ! that's really great news . how often does the magazine come out ? __eou__ it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . __eou__ are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? __eou__ yes , but i'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! __eou__ do you have any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine ? __eou__ i don't have any with me , but i think i could manage to bring a free copy home for you . __eou__ i'm really looking forward to reading your column . __eou__ me , too . do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? __eou__ sure , where would you like to go ? __eou__ perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .
how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ i've never really thought about it before . i guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ i guess so . i usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . how about you ? __eou__ i actually try to avoid name-brand items . i can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place !
it's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? __eou__ it's beautiful . enjoy it while it lasts . it's supposed to get cold tomorrow . __eou__ what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? __eou__ it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . __eou__ that doesn't sound pretty . __eou__ do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ well , i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends . __eou__ you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . __eou__ i suppose i should . i don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ? __eou__ i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! __eou__ if that happens , then i'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . __eou__ that sounds like fun . __eou__ hey , look outside ! it's started to drizzle ! __eou__ english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought .
do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? __eou__ not really . i wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . do you want to go with me ? __eou__ sure . what movies were you thinking about going to ? __eou__ have you heard of hot fuzz ? __eou__ yes . isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed shaun of the dead ? __eou__ that's the one . it's an actioncomedy . what do you think ? __eou__ to be honest , i didn't really like shaun of the dead . besides , i like movies with a happy ending best . __eou__ what do you have in mind ? __eou__ i was thinking of seeing you , me and dupree . it's a typical hollywood blockbuster . __eou__ isn't that the chick flick with kate hudson and owen wilson ? __eou__ yeah , i suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? __eou__ not really . do you like biographical / drama films ? __eou__ it depends on who the film is about . which movie did you have in mind ? __eou__ anne hathaway is in a new movie called becoming jane which is based on a true story about jane austen . __eou__ that sounds fantastic ! what time is it playing ? __eou__ it's on at 8: 00 pm at the phoenix theatres . i have a membership there , so i can book the tickets ahead of time . __eou__ great . shall i meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ? __eou__ sounds good . i'll see you then !
so , have you seen all three the lord of the rings movies ? __eou__ yes , but i didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__ that's the return of the king , right ? __eou__ yeah . even though the customs were brilliant , i didn't think it was as good as the first two . what did you think ? __eou__ i thought the special effects were amazing , but i got a bit confused . the plot was too complicated for me . __eou__ did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__ no . did you ? __eou__ yes , i've read them many times . i think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__ yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__ i also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__ most movies are . another problem for me was the film was dubbed in german with english subtitles . __eou__ that happens a lot in non-english speaking countries . __eou__ i heard that the return of the king was nominated for 11 oscars . __eou__ actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 oscars , too !
are your ready to go to the supermarket ? __eou__ yes , are you ? __eou__ i've got my money and my keys , so i'm ready . __eou__ you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? i'd put a coat on if i were you . __eou__ it wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ well , it's started raining since then . look out the window ! it's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ well , i guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . __eou__ have a look outside for me . does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ it does , actually . maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ that's a good idea . but maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ ok . i'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . it's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ i don't know . the weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ i don't think we have anything to worry about . do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ good idea . that will help us to warm up . __eou__ if i'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ alright . i'll have a cup of tea waiting for you .

you look really wiped out . __eou__ i had meetings back to back all morning . then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the six soap presentation , and the phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office . __eou__ not a good day , i hate to tell you that mr . emory wants to see the designs for the polish paste ad tomorrow morning . __eou__ i can ’ t believe it ! i guess i ’ ll be here until ten again tonight !
thank god ! i am finished writing that service guide ! it took me forever ! __eou__ when did you finish ? __eou__ this morning ! no more overtime , and no more headaches ! __eou__ well , i ’ m glad to hear it . have a cup of coffee !
hello mary . i haven ’ t seen you for ages . are you still seeing paul ? __eou__ no . we broke up last month . i ’ m taking a break from dating for a while . __eou__ did you break up amicably ? sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up . __eou__ we just decided to stop seeing each other . it was all very amicable . are you still going out with mike ? __eou__ yes , i am . we ’ re thinking about getting engaged . we ’ ve been dating for over a year now . __eou__ good for you ! have you seen kelly recently ? is she still dating nick ? __eou__ i havn't seen her for a while.she stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.he was seeing a girl form his office.one day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . __eou__ she was right to do that . i heard the neil and tina getting married soon . __eou__ really ? they ’ ve been together for a long time . when are they getting married ? __eou__ i think it ’ s 26th september . i ’ ll check and make sure that tina remembers to invite you to the hen night . __eou__ thanks . hey , look at that guy over there . i think he fancies you . __eou__ he certainly looks interested , doesn ’ t he ? shall we invite him over to our table ?
melissa ? i ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . __eou__ thanks , frank . i ’ d love to come . when is it ? __eou__ her birthday is on the 9th . we ’ re going to have dinner at a mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . __eou__ sounds like fun . you can count me in ! just give me directions to the restaurant .
how are you wedding plans going ? __eou__ very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . the only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress . __eou__ when will that be ready ? __eou__ the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks . __eou__ you ’ re getting married in three weeks . so that should be ok . so , you ’ ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything . __eou__ yes . we ’ ve taken care of all of that . we decided not to get married in a church though . neither of us is very religious . __eou__ which hotel will the reception be held at ? __eou__ the palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . i ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job . __eou__ oh , yes . it ’ s and excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ yes . it will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people . __eou__ i think you make the right decision .
how many people are in your family ? __eou__ as you know , china has a single-child policy . therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and i . what about in your family ? __eou__ i have one daughter and one son . then there ’ s my husband and i . what about your parents ? do they live with your family ? __eou__ not anymore . they live with my brother now . and yours ? __eou__ my parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . do you just have one brother ? __eou__ no , i have two older brothers and one younger sister . what about you ? __eou__ i also grew up in a big family . i have one older brother and three younger sisters . __eou__ how long have you been married ? __eou__ about seven years now . and you ? __eou__ i ‘ ve been married for about five years . what do you think about divorce ? __eou__ it ’ s becoming more and more common . however , i don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! what about you ? __eou__ if my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , i would get a divorce . __eou__ if that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! __eou__ ( ha ha ) i ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . __eou__ of course not !
that girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? __eou__ do you think so ? i don ’ t like girls who look like that . i like girls who are not too slim . if you like her , go and talk to her . __eou__ i ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . he ’ s very broad-shouldered . __eou__ he ’ s huge ! he must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . __eou__ do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? __eou__ i don ’ t mind , but i like girls with long hair . __eou__ we have different tastes . i like girls with short hair . i like tall girls-probably because i ’ m so tall myself . __eou__ have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? __eou__ no , never . i don ’ t think i ’ ve ever met a girl taller than me ! have you gained weight recently ? __eou__ yes , i have . perhaps i should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . __eou__ i'm getting a bit plump myself . perhaps i ’ ll go with you .
who is cindy ’ s husband ? __eou__ cindy ’ s husband is ron . __eou__ how many children do cindy and ron have ? __eou__ they have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . __eou__ do they have any grandchildren ? __eou__ yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . __eou__ does their daughter get along well with her in-laws ? __eou__ yes , she gets along with them quite well . __eou__ do they have a large family ? __eou__ their family is very similar to cindy and ron ’ s family .
how old is keith ? __eou__ he's 21 . how old is james ? __eou__ he's a year older than keith , but he looks younger . __eou__ how's your father ? __eou__ he's fine . he retired last week . it's a turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . __eou__ he can spend more time with his grandchildren . __eou__ oh , i don't think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world . __eou__ so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea ! __eou__ how do you want to spend your old age ? __eou__ in the same way , probably .
what's the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ i'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . how about in your country ? __eou__ about 70 , i think . this newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . it's a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ i heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ perhaps we need to have more babies ! tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ did she ? that's great . however , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment . __eou__ how's your son these days ? __eou__ oh , he's fine . kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ he'll be a teenager before you know it ! teenagers are often rebellious ! when do you think it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ i had mine when i was 24 . that's a little young . i'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ yes , i think you're right . i'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ? __eou__ yes , there is . teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . they want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . they want to develop their own view of life.parents usually try to discour __eou__ parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ it's almost impossible to get the right balance . if you are too strict , kids might ignore you . if you are too lenient , they might go wild .
i had a big argument with david yesterday . i hope he ’ s not still mad at me . __eou__ what did you argue about ? __eou__ he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he didn ’ t have the money yet . __eou__ well , he should pay you back . it ’ s only fair . __eou__ yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i shouldn ’ t have got angry . __eou__ did you lend him a lot of money ? __eou__ not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill , so i needed the money back . __eou__ well , talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it ’ s nothing unusual . neither of you said anything r __eou__ no , we didn ’ t . i guess you ’ re right . we should patch things up . __eou__ of course you should . you wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ? __eou__ i like people who are open and friendly . those people are usually more active and fun to be with . i like spending time with my friends . we go to bars together or play sports together . __eou__ i don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . honesty is very important to me . __eou__ i think it ’ s important to most people . the problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . __eou__ you can find out from their friends . __eou__ if you know any of their friends . you can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . you have to go out and make the first move sometimes . i also like funny people . __eou__ oh , i don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . you never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . __eou__ sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . __eou__ it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . how is it that we are such good friends ? __eou__ maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends .
when you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? __eou__ i just make eye contact with him and nod my head . then i tell him when he comes over to the table . why do you ask ? __eou__ i went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and i noticed that many people shouted for the bill . __eou__ that seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . __eou__ that ’ s what i thought . i just thought i ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? __eou__ well , it was a warm evening , so i stretched my legs . i walked along the canal for a couple of miles . actually , several other people had the same idea . i saw bill . __eou__ did you ? how is he these days ? __eou__ he seemed ok . we didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . we just waved at each other . __eou__ i need to move some furniture . could you help me to lift it ? __eou__ of course . what do you want to move first ? __eou__ let ’ s move the sofa . can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? i ’ ll lift this end . i want to move it sideways in that direction .
do you like barry ? __eou__ no , not very much . he's too ambitious and dishonest . __eou__ i agree . i like his brother paul . they are not alike . __eou__ yes . they are completely different . paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . __eou__ what kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? __eou__ i think i'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . __eou__ oh , i don't think you're shy ! you are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . __eou__ well . yes , but those people always start talking to me . i never talk to them first.perhaps i'm not as shy as i think . anyway , you're certainly not shy ! __eou__ you're right . i love going out and making new friends . __eou__ so , you'll be at my birthday party on friday ? __eou__ of course !
are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on friday evening ? __eou__ i wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! it ’ s sure to be fun . she ’ s invited a lot of people . do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? __eou__ if everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . but a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . so i think it should be ok ? __eou__ are you taking anything ? __eou__ i ’ ve got her a birthday present and i ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . she told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . i think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . i hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much . __eou__ helen gets on very well with her neighbors . i wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . __eou__ i ’ m really looking forward to it . this party is going to be a blast ! __eou__ well , don ’ t be late . i ’ ll see you on friday at helen ’ s .
that was a great party . thanks for saying behind to help me clear up . __eou__ it certainly was a great party . it ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . __eou__ i expected that something might get broken . that doesn ’ t bother me . that spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? __eou__ i doubt it , i ‘ ll deal with it right away . luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , i ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . __eou__ i ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . __eou__ afterwards , we can do the washing up together . everything will be finished within an hour . your friend keith is really funny . i liked his magic tricks . __eou__ yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? he told some funny stories too . __eou__ amanda told some very funny jokes . at the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . __eou__ i think that she had a litter too much of the punch . __eou__ what did you put in that punch ? it tasted great , but was quite strong . __eou__ that ’ s my little secret . did you like the snacks and i prepared ? __eou__ very much . the birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . __eou__ that cake tasted so good ! it disappeared within minutes , so i think everyone liked it a lot . how ’ s that stain ? __eou__ all cleaned up . are you ready to start on the washing up .

well , it was nice talking to you . __eou__ it was nice talking to you too . __eou__ we should really hang out again . __eou__ that would be fun . __eou__ where do you want to go ? __eou__ i think we should go out to eat . __eou__ that sounds good . __eou__ all right , so i'll see you then . __eou__ i'll call you later . __eou__ okay , i'll talk to you later then . __eou__ see you later . __eou__ bye .

john , i was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year . __eou__ i am going fishing in alaska with my friend , mark . __eou__ what are you talking about ? __eou__ what's wrong with heading out with mark for vacation ? __eou__ you and i have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! __eou__ really ? who made that rule up ? __eou__ with that attitude , i don't really think we have much more to discuss here . __eou__ that works for me !
joe , how are you doing ? __eou__ i am great ! how about you , mary ? how are you ? __eou__ i am doing great ! thank you for asking , joe . __eou__ i was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ? __eou__ i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper . __eou__ ok . what about going to the movies on friday night ? __eou__ what were you planning on seeing ? __eou__ i was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer . __eou__ how about “ the secret life of bees ” ? __eou__ that's a chick flick !
brian and christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , john . __eou__ i thought that i already told you that i am going with mark to alaska . __eou__ are you kidding me ? __eou__ you know what ? you and i had no plans , so i made plans with mark . what's the problem ? __eou__ we have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . __eou__ i don't think that i ever heard of that rule before . any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? __eou__ go on your vacation with mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! __eou__ i am really looking forward to getting away from you . far away from you !
do you enjoy going on dates ? __eou__ yes . i find dates to be a lot of fun . __eou__ what's so fun about them ? __eou__ they give me the opportunity to get to know someone better . __eou__ so you always have fun on dates ? __eou__ not always . i don't always like the person i'm on the date with . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ my date may not be my type . __eou__ so then why would you ask them out in the first place ? __eou__ i didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type . __eou__ sounds like a huge waste of time to me . __eou__ now that i think about it , it really is sometimes .
john , i was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year . __eou__ i've already told my buddy , mark , that i am going hunting with him in alaska . __eou__ you can't be serious ! __eou__ hey , i've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . i am sorry that bothers you . __eou__ after a year together , i thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . __eou__ says who ? i don't think that is necessarily the case . __eou__ you know , now that i think about it , i really don't have much more to say to you at all ! __eou__ whatever you say !
hi joe , how are you doing today ? __eou__ things are going good today . how have you been doing , mary ? __eou__ things are going well for me , joe . __eou__ want to go see a movie tonight ? __eou__ my parents are taking me to dinner tonight . __eou__ could you go with me to the movies on friday night , instead ? __eou__ what movie did you want to see ? __eou__ there is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . __eou__ i was thinking that i would like to see “ the secret life of bees . ” __eou__ oh great ! sounds like something i need to bring kleenex to !
hi kara , it's mike here . __eou__ hi mike , how are you doing ? __eou__ i'm doing well , and you ? __eou__ everything is going great . __eou__ kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this friday ? __eou__ mike , i had a good time too , but i am getting ready to move back to the east coast , so i think i shouldn't get too involved right now . __eou__ well , we could just go out as friends . __eou__ right now , i think i need to really focus on matters at home , but thanks for a nice evening .

hey joe , how have you been ? __eou__ i am doing well . how about you , mary ? __eou__ i am doing ok , joe . __eou__ there is a new movie at the mall that i want to see . want to go with me ? __eou__ i can't because i already promised my roommate that i would go shopping with her . __eou__ i could go to the movies on friday night instead . would that be better ? __eou__ did you have a certain movie in mind ? __eou__ i thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice . __eou__ i kind of wanted to see “ the secret life of bees . ” __eou__ maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie !

it's an ugly day today . __eou__ i know . i think it may rain . __eou__ it's the middle of summer , it shouldn't rain today . __eou__ that would be weird . __eou__ yeah , especially since it's ninety degrees outside . __eou__ i know , it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside . __eou__ yes , it would be . __eou__ i really wish it wasn't so hot every day . __eou__ me too . i can't wait until winter . __eou__ i like winter too , but sometimes it gets too cold . __eou__ i'd rather be cold than hot . __eou__ me too .

it doesn't look very nice outside today . __eou__ you're right . i think it's going to rain later . __eou__ in the middle of the summer , it shouldn't be raining . __eou__ that wouldn't seem right . __eou__ considering that it's over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird . __eou__ exactly , it wouldn't be nice if it started raining . it's too hot . __eou__ i know , you're absolutely right . __eou__ i wish it would cool off one day . __eou__ that's how i feel , i want winter to come soon . __eou__ i enjoy the winter , but it gets really cold sometimes . __eou__ i know what you mean , but i'd rather be cold than hot . __eou__ that's exactly how i feel .

i wish it was a nicer day today . __eou__ that is true . i hope it doesn't rain . __eou__ it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . __eou__ it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . __eou__ it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . __eou__ any rain right now would be pointless . __eou__ that's right , it really would be . __eou__ i want it to cool down some . __eou__ i know what you mean , i can't wait until it's winter . __eou__ winter is great . i wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . __eou__ i would rather deal with the winter than the summer . __eou__ i feel the same way . __eou__ i wish it was a nicer day today . __eou__ that is true . i hope it doesn't rain . __eou__ it wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . __eou__ it wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . __eou__ it would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . __eou__ any rain right now would be pointless . __eou__ that's right , it really would be . __eou__ i want it to cool down some . __eou__ i know what you mean , i can't wait until it's winter . __eou__ winter is great . i wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . __eou__ i would rather deal with the winter than the summer . __eou__ i feel the same way .

have you heard what happened ? __eou__ heard what ? __eou__ deborah already had her baby . __eou__ i didn't know that . __eou__ i thought you knew . __eou__ i honestly didn't know . __eou__ the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . __eou__ that's good to hear . __eou__ will you go and visit them ? __eou__ of course i will . __eou__ i just wanted to give you the good news . __eou__ thanks for letting me know .
what a wonderful dinner ! __eou__ thank you . i am glad that you are enjoying it . __eou__ where did you get your fantastic recipes ? __eou__ i grew up cooking . my mother shared her recipes with me . __eou__ i especially like the wonderful chicken dish . __eou__ that is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish . __eou__ is that shrimp in the soup ? __eou__ yes , do you like it ? i added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables . __eou__ i am happy that the wine i brought for you works well with this meal . __eou__ yes , thank you for bringing the wine . it really complements the meal .
hey george , how is your chicken ? __eou__ my chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . how is your fish ? __eou__ my fish is pretty dry too . __eou__ it's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . it doesn't seem fresh . __eou__ yes , it seems that way to me also . __eou__ how are your vegetables ? __eou__ my vegetables are very soggy . __eou__ mine are the same way . it seems like they've been overcooked . __eou__ i don't usually complain , but i think that we should mention this to the waiter . __eou__ i agree . maybe they can bring us some better food .
george , is your chicken ok ? __eou__ it tastes great , but it is really dry . is your fish all right ? __eou__ my fish is very dry . __eou__ i wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it . __eou__ that's exactly what i was thinking had happened . __eou__ are your vegetables ok ? __eou__ the vegetables are kind of mushy . __eou__ so are mine . i think they left them cooking too long . __eou__ the food here is usually good , so i think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem . __eou__ i think that you are right . maybe they can give us a free dessert or something .
this is a great meal ! __eou__ thank you . i am glad that everything turned out so well . __eou__ who taught you how to cook this well ? __eou__ i took a cooking class at the culinary institute . __eou__ wow , what is in this chicken dish ? __eou__ isn't that great ? that is coconut ginger chicken with rice . __eou__ is the soup a shrimp soup ? __eou__ yes , there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass . __eou__ i think i got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal . __eou__ i appreciate you bringing the wine . it goes well with the chicken .
i really love this meal . __eou__ thanks . i was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal . __eou__ where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ? __eou__ i got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes . __eou__ the chicken is out of this world ! __eou__ i love that dish as well . it is coconut chicken with rice . __eou__ i was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup . __eou__ yes , that soup has a shrimp base . i also added sea vegetables and lemon grass . __eou__ it worked out well that the wine that i brought to share seems to blend well with this meal . __eou__ i love this wine ! it goes very well with the chicken .
would you like some more coffee ? __eou__ no thanks . i'm full . we need to find our waitress and get our bill . __eou__ good luck finding the waitress ! __eou__ the service this evening has kind of sucked . is that our server over there ? __eou__ i'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . __eou__ good . i'll just stay here until you get back . __eou__ so the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . __eou__ how much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? __eou__ i wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . __eou__ i kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . __eou__ i think that we should leave 10 % . __eou__ $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .
do you want some dessert ? __eou__ no thanks . we just need our check . have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ where is our waitress anyway ? __eou__ yes , the service hasn't been the best . is that our waitress over there ? __eou__ i'll walk over and get the bill , since i don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . __eou__ good idea . just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . __eou__ so the bill is $ 36.00 . __eou__ how much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ my first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . __eou__ i agree , but we don't really know the whole story . there may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . __eou__ let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . __eou__ i agree . we will leave $ 3.60 for the tip .
does your chicken taste all right ? __eou__ the chicken tastes wonderful , but it is kind of dry . is your fish ok ? __eou__ my fish has good seasoning but is a little dry . __eou__ it seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us . __eou__ yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . __eou__ are your vegetables a little mushy ? __eou__ the vegetables seem to not be very fresh . __eou__ mine aren't so good , either . __eou__ i usually enjoy the meals here , so i think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal . __eou__ i think that we should let someone know . they will probably want to fix the problem .
you look really nice today . __eou__ thank you . i just got this outfit the other day . __eou__ really , where did you get it ? __eou__ i got it from macy's . __eou__ it's really nice . __eou__ thanks again . you look nice today , too . __eou__ thank you . i just got these shoes today . __eou__ really ? what kind of shoes are they ? __eou__ these are called all star chuck taylors . __eou__ i really like those . how much did they cost ? __eou__ they were about forty dollars . __eou__ i think i'm going to go buy myself a pair .
have you met the new girl ? __eou__ no . have you ? __eou__ she's one of the prettiest girls at the school . __eou__ what does she look like ? __eou__ well , she's quite short . __eou__ how tall would you say that she is ? __eou__ i would say she's only 5 feet . __eou__ what about her facial features ? __eou__ she has light brown eyes , absolutely beautiful . __eou__ i think i know who you're talking about . __eou__ have you seen her ? __eou__ i think that i have .
would you like to order anything else ? __eou__ no , i'm good . all we need now is our check . __eou__ our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight , hasn't she ? __eou__ i think that is our waitress is over by the bar . boy , the service has not been good this evening . __eou__ she doesn't appear to be headed this way , so i will go get the check . __eou__ good . just bring it back and we'll total it together . __eou__ our total for dinner is $ 36.00 . __eou__ what do you think would be the right amount to tip ? __eou__ i kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received . __eou__ i agree that it was bad service , but i heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job . __eou__ i believe that 10 % is just about right amount . __eou__ i think that a tip of $ 3.60 will be the right amount to leave .
have you seen the new girl in school ? __eou__ no , i haven't . __eou__ she's really pretty . __eou__ describe her to me . __eou__ she's not too tall . __eou__ well , how tall is she ? __eou__ she's about 5 feet even . __eou__ what does she look like , though ? __eou__ she has pretty light brown eyes . __eou__ i may know which girl you're talking about . __eou__ so you have seen her around ? __eou__ yes , i have .
i absolutely love what you're wearing today . __eou__ you do ? i just bought this outfit a couple days ago . __eou__ seriously , it looks really nice on you . where did you buy it from ? __eou__ i bought it from the macy's at the santa anita mall . __eou__ i really like that outfit . __eou__ thanks . i think you look nice today , too . __eou__ thank you . i just bought these new shoes earlier today . __eou__ those are nice . what are they ? __eou__ these are some chucks . __eou__ those are great . how much were they ? __eou__ i got them for forty . __eou__ i think i might go and find me my own pair of chucks .
i think that you look very cute today . __eou__ is that right ? this is a brand new outfit . __eou__ what store did you get it from ? __eou__ i went to macy's and picked it out . __eou__ i love your outfit right now . __eou__ well , i think you look nice today too . __eou__ thanks . i found these new shoes earlier at the store . __eou__ i think that those are some really nice shoes . what kind are they ? __eou__ these are chucks . __eou__ your shoes look really nice . how much did you get them for ? __eou__ they only cost me about forty dollars . __eou__ i'm going to go get a pair for myself .
there's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ? __eou__ i haven't seen her yet . __eou__ i think that she is very pretty . __eou__ tell me how she looks . __eou__ she's kind of short . __eou__ what height is she ? __eou__ she's probably about five feet . __eou__ that's nice , but tell me what she looks like . __eou__ the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . __eou__ i think i might've bumped into her before . __eou__ are you telling me that you've seen her before ? __eou__ i believe so .
did you go to school today ? __eou__ of course . did you ? __eou__ i didn't want to , so i didn't . __eou__ that's sad , but have you gone to the movies recently ? __eou__ that's a switch . __eou__ i'm serious , have you ? __eou__ no , i haven't . why ? __eou__ i really want to go to the movies this weekend . __eou__ so go then . __eou__ i really don't want to go by myself . __eou__ well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ? __eou__ no , i think i'm going to go to the movies .
did you make it to school today ? __eou__ i always do . did you go to school today ? __eou__ no , i didn't . __eou__ you should have , but have you seen any movies lately ? __eou__ that was an odd change of subject . __eou__ maybe it was , but answer the question . __eou__ no , not recently . __eou__ i want to go to see a movie this weekend . __eou__ what's stopping you then ? __eou__ i don't want to go alone . __eou__ so , will you be at school tomorrow ? __eou__ no , i want to go to the movies instead .
hey , did you hear about jessica's party this weekend ? __eou__ yeah , but i'm still waiting for my invitation . __eou__ oh really ? she gave me mine earlier today . __eou__ well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today . __eou__ yeah , so are you planning on going ? __eou__ i think so . it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun . __eou__ it really does , i can't wait . __eou__ what time does the party start ? __eou__ it starts at 8 o'clock . __eou__ oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ? __eou__ i'm not sure , but i don't think she's given out that many . __eou__ well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today .
did you even bother to go to school today ? __eou__ yeah , i went . did you go ? __eou__ no , i didn't feel like it . __eou__ that's nice , have you been to the movies lately ? __eou__ no , but that was a random change of subject . __eou__ it may have been random , but have you ? __eou__ i haven't lately . __eou__ i would love to catch a movie this weekend . __eou__ so then , why don't you just go ? __eou__ i don't want to see a movie by myself . __eou__ okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ? __eou__ i think i might just go to the movies .
well , i ’ d better get back to work . i ’ ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! __eou__ me too . i ’ ll see you after work , huh ? __eou__ yeah , definitely . i was hoping to catch a ride with you . __eou__ sure . meet me at five .

all right then , ms . montgomery . i ’ ll get those plans over to your office by thursday afternoon . __eou__ great . that will give me time to talk with my staff before i make final decision . __eou__ that ’ s what i was thinking . i ’ ll have them there by thursday . __eou__ good news . thanks for getting things done so quickly .
thanks for the advice , mr . macmillan . i ’ ll keep it in mind . i had better head off though . i ’ m meeting my husband for dinner . __eou__ sure , i ’ m heading out myself . enjoy your evening . __eou__ thanks , sir . you too . drive safely , i hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . __eou__ thanks for the warning ! see you tomorrow !
have you met the new manager in customer service ? __eou__ no , i haven ’ t gotten over there in a few weeks . how is he ? __eou__ she . she seems to be doing a pretty good job . of course , anything would be better than that last guy ! __eou__ you said it ! i can't believe he lasted as long as he did .
how are you ? __eou__ i ’ m fine , thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here . __eou__ that ’ s for sure . you ’ re new , too , huh ? __eou__ yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago . how about you ?
you have an unusual accent , mr . robbins . where are you from originally ? if you don ’ t mind me asking . __eou__ not at all . i was born in madrid , but i came to the states when i was a teenager . __eou__ i guess that must be what i ’ m hearing , i really couldn ’ t place it . do go back to madrid often ? __eou__ no , i haven ’ t been back for more than ten years .
would you like some more coffee ? __eou__ no thanks . i'm full . we need to find our waitress and get our bill . __eou__ the waitress is bringing the bill right now . __eou__ this waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ? __eou__ yes , this waitress did a great job . __eou__ ok , let's see what the damage is . the total for our meal is $ 36.00 . __eou__ what do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? __eou__ fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . what do you think about 20 % this time ? __eou__ yes , 20 % would be perfect . __eou__ her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . the total will be $ 43.20 . __eou__ yes , that was one fantastic meal ! __eou__ i agree . maybe we can come back again next week .
would you like to order anything else ? __eou__ no , i'm good . all we need now is our check . __eou__ the waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak . __eou__ i have never had bad service at this restaurant , but this time was really exceptional . __eou__ yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience . __eou__ let's take a look at our bill . the total price for our dinner is $ 36.00 . __eou__ how much money should we leave for a tip ? __eou__ i know that 15 % is a normal tip , but i really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us . what do you think about tipping her 20 % ? __eou__ she definitely deserves 20 % for a tip . __eou__ so we can add her tip of $ 7.20 to the bill of $ 36.00 and the total will be $ 43.20 . __eou__ yes , what a wonderful meal ! __eou__ it absolutely was a great meal . we'll have to return here for lunch sometime .
cindy . we were going to try to surprise you for your birthday . but you ’ re just too busy ! can you tell me when you ’ ll be free ? __eou__ oh , brian . that ’ s really sweet of you guys . i would love to get together with all of you . how about friday ? __eou__ great ! what time ? __eou__ i ’ m free all afternoon . why don ’ t we meet at 1 o ’ clock in the lobby ?

do you want some dessert ? __eou__ no thanks . we just need our check . have you seen the waitress ? __eou__ oh , here comes our waitress with our check . __eou__ the service here has been really great , don't you think ? __eou__ yes , the service was quite good . __eou__ so , let's look at the check . the total is $ 36.00 . __eou__ how much do you think we should leave for a tip ? __eou__ usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . i am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . __eou__ i agree that 20 % would be just about right . __eou__ ok , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 . __eou__ yes , what a nice dinner that was ! __eou__ we'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon .

tomorrow i'll take you to some places that i'm sure you will have interest in . __eou__ where else haven't i been to yet ? __eou__ not many but these ones . they are the folk antique handicrafts and collectibles exhibition halls ! __eou__ sounds great ! how many kinds of folk collections they have ? __eou__ well , there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city , that's half the collections of antique objects in china . there's one exhibition hall for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collections . __eou__ private collectors ! oh , they must have excellent collections . i'll go and see each of them . what kinds of collections can i see ? come on , david , don't keep me in suspense ! __eou__ no hurry ! i'll tell you now . the collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars . __eou__ enough , david ! i can't wait anymore . let's go right now ! __eou__ okey , okey . we'll start from the folk collection exhibition house , a multi-folk collection exhibition hall , where the best of local antique objects are on constant display . the hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late king dynasty , a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself . academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there . __eou__ very interesting . that's really a place i must go and see . and then ? __eou__ if you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the butterfly exhibition . mr . chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . quite a lot of them are state-level treasures . __eou__ mr . chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , i should say .
good idea ! i've heard that the expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , tv , street signs , etc . __eou__ yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the china's tourism industry . __eou__ what's interesting to see there ? __eou__ oh , there's plenty . flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . __eou__ i visited the first international flower festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__ oh , can't compare with the kunming expo at all ! the kunming expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the expo . __eou__ it would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__ far more than that , i dare to say ! inland provinces and cities , hong kong and macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . you will feel it a great pity if you missile kunming expo .

do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? __eou__ it ’ s a difficult choice . the train is a litter faster , but much more expensive . __eou__ we could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . __eou__ buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around . __eou__ that ’ s true , but i feel that i see more when i travel by bus . __eou__ really ? i think you see more traveling by train . __eou__ so , which form of transport do you prefer to use ? __eou__ i prefer going by train , ever though it costs more . __eou__ ok them . we ’ ll go by train . i ’ m sure we ’ ll have a good journey . shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? __eou__ the train aren ’ t usually full . we can get them on the day we travel . we should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles . __eou__ we should take a packed lunch on the journey . the food they sell on the trains is always expensive .

i'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes . __eou__ thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it doesn't matter , i'm ready for you . __eou__ great ! as you know , however , the day in new york has hardly begun . __eou__ there's nothing like getting an early start , sir . __eou__ what can i do with my baggage while i visit a few more tourist spots ? __eou__ you can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit . __eou__ isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ? __eou__ i wish it was , but it isn't . they will still want a credit card . __eou__ it's always something , isn't it ? let me think about this for a second . __eou__ don't forget that you have very little time , sir , before you have to check out .

how long will it take us to drive to london ? __eou__ i think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . __eou__ that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours . __eou__ you ’ re right . we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas . __eou__ so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? __eou__ ok . you haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ? __eou__ no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car . __eou__ i think it ’ s over five meters long . i can ’ t remember exactly . it has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . __eou__ wow ! that ’ s fast ! i don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . __eou__ we can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .

welcome to perfect getaway tours . how can i help you ? __eou__ i would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife . __eou__ very well , we have a couple of different options such as beaches , the wilderness , the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend . __eou__ i think something in the countryside would be nice . __eou__ perfect ! this package includes round-trip flights to new hampshire . a free airport pick - up is included . our vip limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger __eou__ sounds good ! what is the hotel that we will be staying at like ? __eou__ that is the best part.your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests.you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this __eou__ wow ! this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ? __eou__ of course ! the hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . you can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard . __eou__ i ’ m sold ! i want to book this trip . i don ’ t care what it costs ! money is no object !
some places aren't good to go.but i can show you the right bus to take . it will be no problem . __eou__ we want to see the statue of liberty too . __eou__ i have never done that myself . but i hear it is very interesting . you two should go . __eou__ you have never gone to the statue of liberty ? ! i can't believe it ! but you live here ! __eou__ yes , but i'm very busy with work.and you know how it is , sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country . __eou__ i know . are the subway trains easy to take here ?
it sure is hot . why don't we go in the haunted house ? at least it will be air conditioned . __eou__ i've told you a thousand times . i don't want to go in the haunted house.it ' s too scary ! __eou__ well . maybe i'll go alone then . i really don't want to miss it . __eou__ go alone if you want . i will wait at that cafe and have a soda . __eou__ it might take a long time . because there is a line , you know . __eou__ i know . but if you don't go in the haunted house , you won't be happy.so i will wait for you . it's no problem . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ how was it ? __eou__ i'm sorry it took so long . __eou__ don't worry about it . but how was it ?
hmm . let me try something.wait . i have a reservation for someone named sang here . but it's spelled j - a - n - g . it's not spelled j - i - a - n - g . it's for a mr . c sang . __eou__ oh , that must be me ! probably they typed the name wrong.my husband's english isn't so good . __eou__ yes , sometimes it happens , ma'am . that's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . i'm sorry about the inconvenience . __eou__ it's okay . it's probably my husband's fault.is there a pool in this hotel ? __eou__ yes , of course.the pool is open until 10:00 p . m . so you still have about 45 minutes . __eou__ good . __eou__ here is your key . your room is 379.you can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.enjoy your stay , ma'am . __eou__ thank you .
i hope the food here is good . __eou__ yes , it is very expensive . maybe we shouldn't have come here . __eou__ but the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.if we are spending three days in hollywood , i want to see at least one star . __eou__ i think we might not see any . __eou__ did you like the tour of universal studios ? __eou__ i thought it was o . k . but it really was too hot.and i think they should show people more . the exhibits should be more interesting . __eou__ i thought it was great . didn't you like the special effects rooms ? __eou__ yes , but i still think it could be better .
alice , it really was great . i think it was the most interesting thing here . you really should go in . __eou__ no , i don't want to . __eou__ really . the special effects are fantastic.you shouldn't be scared . you would really enjoy it . __eou__ sam , i never like haunted houses.when i was a kid , i didn't like them . when i was in high school , i didn't like them.when i was in college , i didn't like them . so why should i like them now ? __eou__ but this is maybe one of the best haunted houses in north america ! it's different . __eou__ why don't we go to the epcot center instead ? they have displays from many cultures around the world . __eou__ i saw that in the guide.it looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.do you want to go ? __eou__ yes . that is something i will enjoy . __eou__ alright , let's go then . how many tickets do we have left ? __eou__ we still have most of the tickets we bought.we can go on a lot of different rides if you like . __eou__ i was only interested in the haunted house and the roller coaster rides.the other rides are for kids . __eou__ let's start walking to the epcot center then.according to this map , it is up this pathway here . __eou__ alright , let's go .
may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i would like to check in . __eou__ do you have a reservation ? __eou__ yes , my name is carol tiang . that's spelled j - i - a - n - g . __eou__ i'm sorry , ma'am . i can't find anything under that name.do you have your confirmation number ? __eou__ no , i don't have it with me.but i know i have a reservation . my husband made it for me last month . __eou__ well , let me look again . how do you spell your first name , ma'am ? __eou__ c - a - r - o - l . carol . __eou__ i don't find a carol in the computer for today . i have a carol larson here . but that reservation is for next monday . __eou__ no , that's not me . my name is tiang , not larson . my husband reserved for me . __eou__ are you sure he used your name , ma'am ? maybe he reserved under his name . __eou__ his name is lin , l - i - n . __eou__ i'm sorry . i have nothing here . __eou__ miss , i know he made this reservation for me .
i'm glad i brought my jacket on this trip . __eou__ yes , i didn't know washington , dc got so cold in winter . __eou__ what would you like to do today ? __eou__ i really think we should take a tour of the white house . __eou__ i thought we could go to some of the museums.don ' t you want to see the museums ? __eou__ of course . but today i feel like seeing the white house.we should see it first , because it's the most famous historical building here . __eou__ i don't agree . i think the capitol building is the most famous.but okay . if you want to see the white house , we'll go see it . i'm just afraid it will be boring . __eou__ boring ? how can it be boring ? it sounds very interesting to me .
excuse me , but i ’ m a bit lost here . where does this street lead to ? __eou__ the queen street , i guess . __eou__ so is it the right way to the city hall ? __eou__ i ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction .
but it's the white house . the president and his family live there.they won't let us see most of it . probably we can only see a couple of rooms . __eou__ no , that's not true.the white house is very big . and there are a lot of historical exhibits there.the tour will take us through many different rooms . i read about it in the guide . __eou__ hmm . if that's true , then the security there must be very good.because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the white house . __eou__ i'm sure the security is very tight.probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . __eou__ so i can't take my gun then . __eou__ don't always joke like that ! you don't have a gun . __eou__ yes , it's true i don't . __eou__ you shouldn't say things like that . you could get arrested ! __eou__ what ? do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? __eou__ no . but if you say something like that in the white house , they may take it seriously . sometimes i think you joke too much . __eou__ i'll be careful . don't worry . i don't want to get arrested by the fbi.but how long does the white house tour last ? __eou__ i'm not sure . i think it lasts about one hour . __eou__ alright . we should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . __eou__ first i want to look in the travel guide.maybe they don't have tours in the morning . __eou__ that's a good idea . do you want some more coffee ? __eou__ no , i'm fine .

i'm going to let bob know about the merger . __eou__ it makes no sense to tell him about that . __eou__ why ? __eou__ because he'll tell mary and that will cause us problems .
sorry , mary , i can't make it in time for dinner . __eou__ okay , bob , when will i see you ? __eou__ maybe i will be around later . __eou__ okay , i'll see you later .
bob was late for work this morning . __eou__ has he been late before ? __eou__ yes , once last week . __eou__ thanks for letting me know .
maybe you should have told me first ? __eou__ why ? __eou__ because we're partners . __eou__ i realize that but i needed to make a decision .
may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i'm looking for bob . __eou__ he's in a meeting with phil . __eou__ no problem , i can wait .

mrs . phoebe , here are your ordered goods . please inspect the goods now . __eou__ all right . let me have a check . can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ? __eou__ our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . it is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . it is the basement for the future cooperation . __eou__ that is good . and here i give you a piece of advice . you should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . what's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes . __eou__ i realize that now . i will do that after a while . __eou__ thank you . can i open the packages to check the color and style ? __eou__ of course , let me help you . __eou__ the color and style are consistent with the sample . great ! __eou__ you know , we are superior to other clothes companies . __eou__ yes , that's for sure . there is nothing wrong with the quality . i think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons . __eou__ ok . we will manage it later .
hello , green trading company . what can i do for you ? __eou__ i'm mr . stephen's secretary . he has an appointment with mr . green today . __eou__ yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon . __eou__ i'm afraid we have to reschedule it . __eou__ didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? __eou__ i'm very sorry . but mr . stephen must leave for hong kong right away . __eou__ how about friday afternoon ? __eou__ that will be fine .
kim , have you made contact with mr . lee ? __eou__ not yet , mr . wang . but i'm working on it . __eou__ what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ i just keep getting a busy signal . __eou__ maybe his phone is out of order . anyway , keep working on it . i really need an answer about the contract i sent him . __eou__ all right , i'll let you know when i get through .
linda , it's really late . let's call it a day . __eou__ good idea . we can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning . __eou__ sure thing . do you want me to give you a ride home ? __eou__ that ’ s great . thanks for the ride . i really appreciate 1 it . you know my car is still in the shop . __eou__ don't mention it . it ’ s my pleasure . __eou__ it's very nice of you .
mrs . lee , i ’ ve stayed here for almost a week . and i really must leave tomorrow . __eou__ please feel free to stay as long as you want . you know you ’ re always welcome here . __eou__ thank you . you ’ ve been so nice to me . __eou__ is there anything else i can do for you before your leave ? __eou__ no , thanks . you ’ ve done a lot for me already . thank you for everything . __eou__ don ’ t mention it . i ’ ve really enjoyed your company .
oh , this is monica __eou__ ok . commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . __eou__ yes . let's first define the inspection right . __eou__ following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . __eou__ would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? __eou__ inspection is to be done by the china commodity inspection and testing bureau . usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . __eou__ and can you tell me about the re-inspection ? __eou__ yes . the re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . __eou__ i see . how do they make testing and analysis of this item ? __eou__ they always use the standard and method laid down in the contract . __eou__ what if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ? __eou__ a seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct .

your pc is so amazing . are you doing trade on internet ? __eou__ thank you for your compliment . i bought this pc with my first-month salary . i am getting to know the on-line trade . __eou__ i'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet . __eou__ yes , i often do business through internet now . __eou__ oh , really ? is it a good way ? __eou__ yes , very gorgeous . sometimes , i can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . __eou__ what advantages does it have ? __eou__ firstly , it is convenient . and secondly , it has low cost , because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service . __eou__ i agree with you . it will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition . __eou__ the most important is that it is very convenient . you know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time . even you can have e-contract with your regular customers . __eou__ so cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . __eou__ sure , but every coin has two sides . doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways . __eou__ will you give me some suggestion ? __eou__ of course , such as alabama , which is a famous website . __eou__ thank you . maybe i will do business through internet in the future .
mr . wang , have you enjoyed your stay here ? __eou__ of course , i ’ ve enjoyed it very much . i ’ ve met my old friends and made some new friends . __eou__ we ’ ve all enjoyed being with you . when will you come back ? __eou__ sometime next year . __eou__ i ’ m looking forward to seeing you again . take care . __eou__ the same to you . keep in touch .

hello , fred . what are you doing ? __eou__ i'm doing the business online . __eou__ can you tell me the concept of e-commerce ? now , many people mentioned the word , ' e-commerce ' , in front of me . __eou__ e-commerce , or electronic commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the internet . __eou__ what kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ? __eou__ we can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on . __eou__ what are the benefits of e-commerce ? __eou__ firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . and secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . and thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on internet . __eou__ how things have changed now !
your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . we have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . __eou__ we appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . __eou__ that's true . however at the fair last march , people were so interested in chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . __eou__ do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? __eou__ i'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . __eou__ well , we'll consider your proposal .
i know that you are interested in our washers . __eou__ yes , we are thinking of placing an order . however we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms , including mode of payment , discount and possible date of delivery . __eou__ we supply washers of all types and sizes . we have years of experience in the manufacture of washers . __eou__ we have read about this in your sales literature . could you give us some idea of your prices ? __eou__ our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in europe or anywhere else . here are our latest price lists . you will see that our prices are very attractive . __eou__ do you take special orders ? that is , do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients ? __eou__ sure , we do . __eou__ how long does it usually take you to make delivery ? __eou__ as a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant l / c . it takes longer , of course , for special orders . in no case would it take longer than six months . __eou__ good . one more thing , we'd like you to quote us on cif basis . __eou__ okay . no problem .
mr . smith , i would like to get right to the point here . first , we need to talk about how much each company will pay . __eou__ well , we want to have the largest share . our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer . __eou__ let's look at that another way . the major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . __eou__ what are you thinking about ? __eou__ we do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . we are a good , small company---that's why you are interested . __eou__ then , what would make you feel more comfortable ? __eou__ if you take a 75 % position in the venture , we would take a back seat to you .
this is our best product . __eou__ how long will it take to make five hundred ? __eou__ they'll be done before the end of the week . __eou__ good .
have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ? __eou__ i wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . __eou__ i'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__ but our order this time is very large . to open an l / c for such a large amount at a bank is costly . can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? __eou__ i'm afraid not . we insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . __eou__ to be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . when i open a letter of credit with a bank , i have to pay a deposit . that will tie up my money and add to my cost . __eou__ consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum .

i was told to come to you to get a chest x-ray . __eou__ no problem . just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on , with the opening in the back . __eou__ then what should i do ? __eou__ you will stand over here up against this plate . __eou__ should i just stand naturally ? __eou__ you will raise your arms up shoulder high . __eou__ is this all right ? __eou__ yes , you are doing great . __eou__ where will you be going ? __eou__ i need to stand behind this shield . now you will take a deep breath , hold it , and let it out . __eou__ is that it ? __eou__ that ’ s it . you can get dressed when the film is developed .
i came here to get a chest x-ray . __eou__ i will need you to take your clothes off from the waist up and put on the gown , leaving the opening in the back . __eou__ what comes next ? __eou__ i will need you to face this glass plate right over here . __eou__ should i do anything else ? __eou__ your arms need to be raised to shoulder height . __eou__ is this ok ? __eou__ so far , so good . __eou__ how come you are walking away ? __eou__ i am not leaving . i just need you to take a really deep breath , hold it , and then let it out . __eou__ will i be finished then ? __eou__ you will be able to put your clothes on as soon as i have checked the film .
you look kind of green . __eou__ i don ’ t feel so good . i am feeling sick to my stomach . __eou__ have you had anything to eat lately ? __eou__ i had fried shrimp and clams for lunch . __eou__ perhaps the food was bad . __eou__ perhaps , but i haven ’ t felt well for a few days now . __eou__ has anything been upsetting you lately ? __eou__ my stress level is pretty much what is usually is . __eou__ do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ? __eou__ it seems to me like i may have caught a bug .
are you feeling ok ? __eou__ my stomach is bothering me . __eou__ what have you been eating ? __eou__ i had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch . __eou__ maybe the food had something wrong with it . __eou__ it could be bad food , but i didn ’ t feel so well yesterday , either . __eou__ have you been under a lot of pressure lately ? __eou__ i haven ’ t been under any more stress than usual . __eou__ perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around . __eou__ i feel like maybe i am coming down with the flu .
my doctor said that i need a chest x-ray . __eou__ just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back . __eou__ what should i do after that ? __eou__ you need to come over here and face this plate . __eou__ am i standing the right way ? __eou__ i will need your arms raised to shoulder height . __eou__ am i doing this the right way ? __eou__ everything you are doing is perfect . __eou__ are you going to leave ? __eou__ i am just getting behind this screen . you need to take a deep breath , hold it , and then breathe normally . __eou__ is that all there is to it ? __eou__ you can get dressed as soon as the film is processed . we will be all done here .
you don ’ t look so good . __eou__ i have a major stomachache __eou__ did you eat something strange ? __eou__ i had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch . __eou__ maybe you have food poisoning . __eou__ yes , that could have been it , but i haven ’ t been feeling that great for the past few days . __eou__ are you under a lot of stress ? __eou__ not really . things have been going ok . __eou__ maybe you have a touch of the flu . __eou__ i think that i might be getting the flu .

you look a bit under the weather . __eou__ i am not feeling all the great . i think i have that crud that is going around . __eou__ i know that it ’ s going around the dorms . __eou__ my boyfriend hasn ’ t been feeling so well . maybe he passed it on to me . __eou__ i have some cold tablets if you would like one . __eou__ mostly , i feel like i need some rest and hot soup . __eou__ drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold . __eou__ my grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold . __eou__ you could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions . __eou__ if things don ’ t get better in a few days , i will look for some other solutions .
can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? __eou__ sure . if you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . it ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . __eou__ i need to excise my arms too . how can i do that ? __eou__ one good way is to do push-ups . another way is to use weights . make sure you grip the weights firmly . you don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! __eou__ when i do push-ups , should i bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? __eou__ you don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . the most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight . many people bend the __eou__ what ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? __eou__ one that i recommend is that you lie on your back . you should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out side of your body . __eou__ so i need plenty of space for this exercise . __eou__ yes , you do . lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . __eou__ great . thanks for you advice !

what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can ’ t eat anything . __eou__ let ’ s have a look . mmmm . this doesn ’ t look too good . i think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . it ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain . __eou__ when you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ? __eou__ first we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . i also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling . __eou__ i guess that ’ s what i get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . __eou__ it could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . in any case , i ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing !

hey , you look great ! how's everything ? __eou__ yeah , you know what ? i've been going to the club regularly . the training really pays off . now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit . __eou__ really ? tell me about it . i haven't gone to the club for a long time . i am too busy with work . __eou__ it's important to do proper exercises . __eou__ you're right . too much or too little won't do any good . __eou__ the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet . __eou__ sounds reasonable . __eou__ we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . __eou__ and fruits ! __eou__ surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . __eou__ i've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? __eou__ yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can help one to keep sound physical health . __eou__ i think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . __eou__ you bet it !
why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? __eou__ well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . __eou__ what are they ? __eou__ one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . __eou__ why ? __eou__ the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . __eou__ that makes sense . probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . __eou__ and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . there is one final reason why so many people are fat . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ nobody exercises anymore-not even kids ! the average american home has the tv on for 6 hours a day ! __eou__ wow ! no wonder people are so fat . say , carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . __eou__ yeah , i guess so . __eou__ you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . __eou__ hey , i started a diet and lost 10 pounds . __eou__ so what happened ? __eou__ well , i quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . __eou__ you should have kept trying .

good morning . how are you ? __eou__ i'm very worried , doctor __eou__ oh ? what are you worried about ? __eou__ i'm afraid that i'm very ill . __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that . why do you think so ? __eou__ because i feel tired all the time , even when i wake up in the morning . i find very difficult to do any work . i have no appetite . my wife cooks me delicious meals but i can only eat a little . __eou__ how do you sleep ? __eou__ very badly , doctor . __eou__ do you find it difficult to get to sleep , or do you wake up early ? __eou__ both , doctor . i never get to sleep until two o'clock and i always wake up at five . __eou__ are you worried about anything ? __eou__ well , yes , i am . i'm worried about my work . i've just taken a new job . i earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . i'm always afraid of making a mistake . __eou__ i see . please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch . __eou__ yes , doctor . ( the doctor examines the patient ) __eou__ well , there's nothing very much wrong with you , i'm glad to say.you ' re working too hard and worrying too much.do you take much exercise ? __eou__ no , doctor . i never have enough time for exercise . i start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . then i can't get to sleep . can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ? __eou__ i can , but i'm not going to . you don't need medicine . you need advice . don't work so hard . too much work is bad for you . don't worry about your work.it ' s silly to worry . take regular exercise . __eou__ but i may lose my job , doctor ! it's hard to get a job like mine . __eou__ then get an easier one , even if you earn less money . which would you rather have , health or wealth ? __eou__ you're right , doctor . it's more important to be healthy than wealthy . i'll change my job . i'm grateful for your advice . __eou__ come and see me again in a month's time . i think you'll be a different man !
well , peter . i'm sorry you're ill . what's the matter with you ? __eou__ i don't know , doctor . i'm ill . i have a headache and a stomachache . __eou__ show me your torgue.what did you eat yesterday ? __eou__ well , doctor , i . . . __eou__ did you eat any cake ? __eou__ yes , i ate some cake . __eou__ did you eat any ice cream ? __eou__ well , yes , i did . i ate some ice cream . __eou__ did you eat any candy ? __eou__ well , yes , i did . i ate some candy . __eou__ young man , tell me everything you ate yesterday evening . __eou__ weki , doctor . i went to a birthday party . __eou__ i see ! how many pieces of cake did you eat ? __eou__ three , doctor . __eou__ how many plates of ice ream did you eat , young man ? __eou__ gosh , doctor . i had only three plates of ice cream.john had four .

what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ i have a really bad toothache ! my cheek is swollen and i can ’ t eat anything . __eou__ let ’ s have a look . mmmm . this doesn ’ t look too good . i think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . it ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain __eou__ when you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ? __eou__ first we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . i also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling . __eou__ i guess that ’ s what i get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . __eou__ it could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . in any case , i ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing !

how have you been doing lately ? __eou__ actually , i haven ’ t been sleeping well . i am kind of out of it . __eou__ is there some reason why you can ’ t get enough sleep ? __eou__ i go to bed , but i just can ’ t get comfortable enough to stay asleep . __eou__ when do you turn in for the night ? __eou__ i usually try to go to bed around 11 __eou__ do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep ? __eou__ my mother is ill with cancer , and i think about her a lot . __eou__ do you ever meditate or read before bedtime ? __eou__ i usually watch a lot of television before i go to bed . maybe i should try something else to help me quiet down .
has everything been ok with you lately ? __eou__ i haven ’ t been able to get a good night ’ s sleep lately . i ’ m exhausted ! __eou__ have you been too busy to get enough sleep ? __eou__ i try to go to sleep , but i just can ’ t stay asleep . __eou__ how late do you try to go to sleep ? __eou__ i go to bed when i finish my work . __eou__ has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately ? __eou__ i am worried about how i am going to pay my tuition . __eou__ you might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head . __eou__ doing something relaxing before i go to sleep sounds like a plan .

i ran it against that fence pole as i crashed . what do you think ? damn , it hurts ! __eou__ we'll have to get you to a hospital . i can ride you on the back of my bike . __eou__ i'm lucky i wasn't killed . i must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.there was too much gravel on that corner . i slid out . __eou__ yes , i almost slid too.alright . this tourniquet is tight . how does it feel ? __eou__ make it tighter . i want the blood stopped.then wrap some bandages around the cut . then we can go . ouch ! i hope i can walk . __eou__ alright , i'm twisting it around . you tell me when to stop . __eou__ there . stop !
no . just let me see a doctor . i'm worried about my arm . __eou__ be brave , sir . it won't be long . i will fill out the form for you . what is your name ? __eou__ steve schliessman . s c h l i e s s m a n . __eou__ alright steve . your social security number ? __eou__ 349-95- 8821 . __eou__ do you have medical insurance ? __eou__ yes , i do . blue cross . __eou__ do you have your insurance card with you ? __eou__ no , i don't . __eou__ well , you can call it in later . you can phone us . __eou__ can i sit down now ? __eou__ first i need to get your address . try to move your arm as little as possible .
excuse me . i need to refill this prescription . __eou__ it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . __eou__ yes , i need to refill it today . __eou__ alright . i'm sorry , miss . according to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . __eou__ i was worried about that . i couldn't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not . __eou__ well , it looks like you have.you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . __eou__ listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . so i can't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i've run out.can you just refill it once more ? __eou__ i'm sorry , miss . we can't do it . we must follow the prescription.and this prescription has run out . __eou__ but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i'll have another prescription . __eou__ miss , i understand your problem.but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.it ' s the law . i can't do anything about it.we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never . __eou__ but i have a prescription . i just need more of it . __eou__ a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i'm sorry , miss . it's the law.you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . __eou__ oh , it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan , and i can only see one doctor.it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . __eou__ miss , i just can't help you on this . i'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens.but there is nothing i can do about it . i'm sorry . __eou__ this is ridiculous ! in taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when i need it . __eou__ maybe that's true . i don't know.but i'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too .
good morning , how are you doing today ? __eou__ i have been feeling pretty good , dr . smith . __eou__ so , i can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical . __eou__ yes , i am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam . __eou__ we are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . __eou__ i ’ ve being kind of been having problems being out of breath . can you look at that ? __eou__ yes , i will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later . __eou__ thank you . what will the blood test tell you ? __eou__ we will be checking for blood sugar , cholesterol , and white blood cell count . __eou__ i have been working hard to stay healthy . i hope the tests turn out well .
i need help . i think my arm is broken . __eou__ alright . have you been to this hospital before ? __eou__ no , i haven't . i need help quick . it hurts really badly . __eou__ i understand . it's good you came to the emergency room . __eou__ let me see a doctor . __eou__ i'm sorry , sir . you will need to wait at least a short time.we are very busy tonight . there was a big car accident on highway 106 . __eou__ i thought this was the emergency room . __eou__ it is . but unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.you aren't bleeding , are you ? __eou__ no . only a little . i fell off my porch . __eou__ oh , that's terrible . is it your right arm or your left arm ? __eou__ my left arm . __eou__ can you fill out this form then ? __eou__ no , i can't . i'm left-handed . __eou__ that's very inconvenient for you then.you ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . __eou__ yes . but why do i have to fill out a form anyway ? this is the emergency room . __eou__ yes , it is . but even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
hi , mr . smith . i ’ m dr . hawkins . why are you here today ? __eou__ i thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up . __eou__ yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . you should have one every year . __eou__ i know . i figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? __eou__ well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . so , try to come at least once a year for your own good . __eou__ o . k . __eou__ let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath , please . do you smoke , mr . smith ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . you really should quit . __eou__ i ’ ve tried a hundred times , but i just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . __eou__ well , we have classes and some medications that might help . i ’ ll give you more information before you leave . __eou__ o . k . , thanks , doctor .
ah ! it hurts . don't touch it . __eou__ what part hurts ? __eou__ the shoulder . __eou__ well , maybe you broke it . but what i'm worried about is this cut . __eou__ it's not a cut . it's a gash ! it's bigger than a cut ! ah ! i need a doctor . __eou__ c'mon . just don't move . __eou__ i'm bleeding too much . __eou__ we don't have a decent first aid kit , do we ? __eou__ yes . my bike has one under the seat . get it , quick ! __eou__ there's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . i don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . what we need is a tourniquet . __eou__ wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.that will work as a tourniquet.after that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . __eou__ good plan . let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__ no , forget that ! do the tourniquet first . i'm losing too much blood . __eou__ alright , alright . how did you cut this so bad ?
my wife is in labor ! __eou__ here , ma ’ am please get on the stretcher . __eou__ is doctor hawkins here ? she ’ s our doctor . we called her from the car . __eou__ calm down , sir . we ’ ll call her to make sure she ’ s on the way . __eou__ thanks . sorry . it just came as such a surprise . the baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks . __eou__ how long has she been in labor ? __eou__ about fifteen minutes . __eou__ o . k . are you planning on being in the delivery room , sir ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ please follow the nurse . she ’ ll get you ready .
well , mr . smith . that ’ s a nasty infection you have . __eou__ yes . is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ? __eou__ i ’ m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning . __eou__ ok . thank you . where should i buy them ? __eou__ the pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic . __eou__ great . what floor is the pharmacy on ? __eou__ the fourth . i ’ ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out . __eou__ thank you .
look , jim . that man just fell down over there . __eou__ we better see if he ’ s o . k . __eou__ sir ... sir ? are you all right ? sir ? __eou__ he ’ s not answering . you ’ d better check his pulse and breathing . __eou__ oh , no . he ’ s not breathing , and there ’ s no pulse . call 911 . __eou__ hello ? yes . someone has passed out at connecticut ave . and 1st st . he isn ’ t breathing and does not have a pulse . yes . my friend is performing cpr . ok . thank you . they ’ re sending an ambulance . here , let me help .

oh ! ! ! i have a horrible toothache . __eou__ you should go to the dentist . __eou__ i hate dentists . __eou__ well , suffer then . if you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . __eou__ it always hurts . i hate going . __eou__ stop being such a baby . if it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . __eou__ o . k . , o . k . , i ’ ll go . __eou__ good . you feel better after you do .

sir , i am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . it is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . we are beginning to get more attention from overseas . __eou__ well done , fred . do you know something useful for our promotion for our i-series ? __eou__ ok , let me see . i suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . __eou__ that is a good idea to start with . i also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . __eou__ yes , the mass media has wider influence . one of my classmates works in an advertisement company . i can get help and inspiration from him . and we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . personally , i prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider .

our benefits usually include medical insurance , public accumulation fund and allowances . __eou__ what are the allowances ? __eou__ if you go on a business trip , you will enjoy the allowance . it is 200 yuan per day . __eou__ well , i see . and what about the vacation in our company ? __eou__ as a new-comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . and remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave . __eou__ will our company have some recreational activities ? __eou__ of course . in spring and autumn , we will hold some sports actives . and in movie seasons , we bulk purchase film tickets .
now let me tell you your definite duties in this office and this is your desk . please sit down . __eou__ i see . thank you . sir , what kind of duties will i do ? __eou__ b , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . is that difficult ? __eou__ it's easy . is there anything i can do for you , sir ? __eou__ well . i have nearly forgotten . mr green from abc company had an appointment with me , but i will be very busy at that time . if he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week . __eou__ i will leave a memo for you , sir .
can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ? __eou__ what kind of cottons are they ? may i see your list ? ah , machine prints . __eou__ yes , mainly prints . there are a few plain as well . here they are . __eou__ i see . and the quantities . __eou__ 200 rolls of each . make it 200 rolls for each sample . __eou__ how many rolls altogether ? __eou__ twenty prints and five plain . that makes 5,000 rolls in all . __eou__ six weeks , did you say ? __eou__ yes , five to six weeks . __eou__ we could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . the prints might be put off to eight weeks . __eou__ eight weeks ? we can wait that long . __eou__ that's the best we can do just now , i'm afraid . __eou__ can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ? __eou__ what about taking the prints in two shipments ? two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later . __eou__ that might be acceptable . i shall have to cable our beijing office to get their approval . you can definitely supply in the time you've given me , i suppose . __eou__ yes , i'll see that you get those delivery . shipping by ' s . s . american ' as usual , is that all right ? __eou__ that's right . __eou__ when can we expect your confirmation of the order ? __eou__ as soon as i hear from beijing , that will be either friday or saturday . __eou__ all right .
these goods can be broken very easily , so we would be thankful if you would be sure to use durable packing materials . __eou__ that will be no problem . we never use any kind of inferior packaging . your goods will be safe . __eou__ good . can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container ? __eou__ we always do that , but i will make a point to check it for you since it is so important . __eou__ do you always put a quality mark on each container ? for this shipment it is crucial to us that you do . __eou__ we don't usually do that unless we are asked to . i'li tell my staff to take care of this for you . __eou__ thanks . this shipment is so important to us there cannot be any foul-ups .
what kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? __eou__ cartons . is that okay ? __eou__ i'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . __eou__ well , what i can tell you is this . we've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . so they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . __eou__ in that case , i guess i can rest assured . __eou__ well , i guess you can say that . the safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . __eou__ you're right . but wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? __eou__ we sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . __eou__ it wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? let's still use cartons . __eou__ sure , no problem . as i said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . you don't have to worry about it .
could i have a word with you , madam ? __eou__ is that you , janice ? just speaking . __eou__ i have to tell you that i can't be in today and tomorrow . __eou__ so sorry to hear that . what's wrong with you ? __eou__ i feel sick and coughed a lot at night . __eou__ is that serious ? you ought to see a doctor . __eou__ yes , i did this in the morning . and my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days . __eou__ that's good . do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ? __eou__ i hope so . and i will definitely tell you if i can not . __eou__ well , take care of yourself . and hope you will be better as soon as possible .
let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms . __eou__ i suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . __eou__ i fully understand your position . an irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . but , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . we've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . can't you give us d / a or d / p ? __eou__ i'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by l / c . __eou__ but on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of l / c payment for our imports . and there is the licensing problem . __eou__ i understand that . still , i'm not in a position to help you . maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together .
can you effect shipment during september ? __eou__ i don't think we can make it . __eou__ then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ? __eou__ by the middle of october . __eou__ it's too late . you see , in our market october is the season for the kind of commodity . so the goods must be shipped before october or we won't be ready for the season . __eou__ well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery . __eou__ thanks . then may i suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on september 15 or earlier ' ? __eou__ let me see . now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . well , we can manage it on 20th september . that's the best we can do . __eou__ oh , that's very considerate of you . i'li take your word for it .
sir , i want to ask for a leave for five days . here is the request form . __eou__ let me see your form . you mentioned that you want five days to go back home for new year , right ? __eou__ yes , i need to go home to have a family reunion . __eou__ do you still remember we already have a new year celebration on january 1st ? __eou__ yes , sir . i remember it . but our chinese usually celebrate the new year on lunar calendar . __eou__ well , i understand that . your request is approved . remember to give my best regards to your parents .
well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment . __eou__ because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time l / c , say , 60 days l / c . __eou__ payment by sight l / c is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight l / c . __eou__ but we have only moderate mean at hand . if you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . __eou__ accepting time l / c is unusual and i've never done it before , but we could consider your request . i'll phone our company to see what they say . __eou__ thank you for your consideration . when will you let me know your answer ? __eou__ this afternoon .
what do you think about the equipment in our company ? __eou__ we have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible . __eou__ i also realized this issue . and office automation is essential . __eou__ besides , internet tends to be more essential now in the information age . __eou__ good idea . a network of work stations is helpful for our management . __eou__ and , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function . __eou__ you are right . the current equipment of our offices really falls behind . next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment .
david , how is your interview ? __eou__ i was nervous at that time . what about you ? __eou__ just fine . i tried to answer every question raised by hr carefully . i found some answering skills are useful . these questions are different from exams . __eou__ we can have a rest now after this tough interview . __eou__ don't be rush . it is suggested to write a letter for the personnel department of future clothes company . __eou__ sounds like a good idea . and i think this can leave deep impression to hr . how can we write a suitable letter ? __eou__ just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . and you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . __eou__ i am getting to know your meaning .
could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? i am going to receive some urgent fax from a company . __eou__ of course . let me check it . firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . __eou__ that's right . __eou__ after overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . __eou__ i couldn't agree more . __eou__ and then prepare what you want to receive . if you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . __eou__ what can i do next ? __eou__ the next thing you should do is to wait . the sender will give you the fax . __eou__ look . some of the faxes come through blurred . what is wrong with it ? __eou__ maybe we should call its after-service man .
how much tea are you going to order ? __eou__ we want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . __eou__ when do you want to deliver the goods ? __eou__ we'd like you to execute the first delivery by june 30 and the second delivery by august 15 . __eou__ i'm sorry , but june 30 is quite soon . i can't guarantee 1 500 cases , i'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . __eou__ i can agree to that . __eou__ let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by june 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by august 15 . right ? __eou__ right . __eou__ well , if there's nothing else , i think we've settled everything . __eou__ let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship .
how are you doing ? pretty good , i imagine ? __eou__ actually not so good . that's why we made a special trip to see you . __eou__ ok , let me hear it . i'd be glad to help if i can . __eou__ good . i want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . __eou__ well , i trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . __eou__ i would like to explain to you our financial position . the manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . it takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . __eou__ but for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . __eou__ well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . __eou__ in what way can we solve the problem ? __eou__ have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? __eou__ yes . but the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . __eou__ so , we propose your company apply to hongkong and shanghai banking corporation for a long-term loan . six months before each shipment , you through hongkong and shanghai banking corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable l / c which is to remain valid for two months . __eou__ well , we accept your suggestion .
i'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . __eou__ it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . __eou__ what about a draft at 120 days sight ? __eou__ all right . but we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . __eou__ a bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . __eou__ then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . __eou__ i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . __eou__ so do i .
how many do you intend to order for our shirts ? __eou__ what's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ? __eou__ we are not interested in small orders . i suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen . __eou__ no problem . we want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? __eou__ yes , of course . we have enough productivity . you can rest assured . __eou__ and for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount . __eou__ sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent . __eou__ that's great .
we like your product , and are interested in placing an order with you as soon as possible . __eou__ well , we can proceed with the order until after the christmas holidays . our factories will be closed for another week . __eou__ that's all right . we will send you a purchase order in one week . i hope you will be able to take care of it . __eou__ no problem . once we get your purchase order , we will begin the execution of the order right away . __eou__ thanks . we need the products in less than one month , because we have a big deal with another company . by the way , will payment against delivery be ok ? __eou__ that will be fine . and i can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order .
we will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here . __eou__ good . and because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . __eou__ well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new i will listen to what you have to say . __eou__ we want to make this a trial order . if we can sell all the products in two months , we will pay for them ; if not , we will send them back to you . __eou__ i can't agree to that . my company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back . __eou__ we promise that if the products are sold out in two months , we will place a repeat order right away , at the same quality . __eou__ ok , i agree . but the repeat order can't have the same terms .
you look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . __eou__ of course , just five minutes ago i got the phone call from future clothes company and i was told to start my trial period in that company next monday . __eou__ congratulations ! let's get together sometime . __eou__ great idea . __eou__ well , i am worried to death right now ! there is still no news from the company for me . __eou__ let it be ! time will tell . __eou__ maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . let me check my mail-box again .
to start with , may i ask why you chose to work at our company ? __eou__ first , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . second , i can improve myself by working here . __eou__ well , please look at the employment contract . i'd like to go over the main details again before signing . first , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved . __eou__ yes , i get it . will the medical plan cover me while on duty ? __eou__ of course . a reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . any extended illness will be covered by insurance . have you read the other terms of the contract ? __eou__ yes , i have read . in the contract , i am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . is that right ? __eou__ yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off . __eou__ that's exactly my understanding . __eou__ good . now , you sign here , you can start work the beginning of next month .
steven , have a rest . could you have a talk with me ? __eou__ ok ! what can i do for you , madam ? __eou__ janice has just got sick and i need a hand now . could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? __eou__ when do you want me to come ? __eou__ let me think . about half past seven if it is okay for you . __eou__ that's fine . i can make it .
fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? __eou__ sure , what's the matter ? __eou__ as you know , i have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but i am not sure i can do my work well . and right now my dilemma is that i can not find a person whom i can trust for these three programs . __eou__ what do you think we can do about this ? __eou__ we are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . so , to be honest , i want you to help me to finish all these programs . __eou__ well , sir , i am busy in market development . so i am worried whether i can do this . __eou__ i am aware you have been working so hard . before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . __eou__ ok ! i will try this .
good morning . my name is penny white . i'm new here . __eou__ nice to meet you . my name is tyler smith . let's go to your office desk , follow me please . __eou__ ok . __eou__ here is your working place . nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . i'm going to call her now so that you can get started . is that ok ? __eou__ yes , that's ok . i'm glad to get started . __eou__ if you have any further questions , just ask me . __eou__ ok . thank you very much . __eou__ you are welcome . have a nice day .

my pal , you are so nervous recently . you don't need to be like that . __eou__ i am worried about that arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . that will be embarrassing . __eou__ just use your head . if you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . __eou__ i had a nightmare last night and i dreamt arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . i was terrified to wake up after hearing that . __eou__ that is merely a dream . remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . i think we did the good job in the whole period . __eou__ i know what you are talking about . the performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . there is no surprise during the actual review .
in the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ? __eou__ of course . i spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . and since i was employed , i have been working on them . madam , how am i doing ? are you satisfied with my job ? __eou__ how do you feel what you have done ? did you meet our goals ? __eou__ i suppose so . i tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . certainly without my colleagues ' help , i could not do these things in such a short period . __eou__ yes . and you also overworked in last month , when steven asked for leave . i have been very satisfied with your performance . and your dependability has been a great asset . __eou__ thanks for your praise , madam .

ok , i just want to brief you all on the travel market in taiwan . to start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in taiwan focuses mainly on tours . this segment of the industry is well developed . __eou__ sorry to interrupt , doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? __eou__ yes , of course . most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . another thing is that most travelers to the uk tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . this age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . they kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . they are not into mountain climbing in wales or anything . __eou__ i don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? __eou__ just a moment . i'll tell you about that in a minute . where was i ? oh yes . by way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the uk for this kind of traveler over the last five years . if you look at page ten you can see what i mean . in spite of these characteristics of the market , i still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . __eou__ so how do you intend to do that ? __eou__ ok , let me tell you what we ’ ve been doing . we ’ ve been in touch with the wales and scottish tourist development offices here in taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . we ’ ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . __eou__ may i interrupt you for a moment ? __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ how much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? __eou__ well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . we haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . __eou__ i see . ok . so what ’ s next ? __eou__ well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . we ’ re also going to run some ads on tv and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . we ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town .

fred , have you made the plan for april 28th ? __eou__ yes , sir . shall i explain the details of the plan now ? __eou__ you go ! __eou__ according to your schedule , you will visit the times company , including its office building , workshops and stores , in the morning from 8: 30 to 11 __eou__ is there anything after the meeting ? in that case , would you add one plan ? i want to visit our guest mr . ross after the meeting . can you arrange it for me ?
what is your salary now ? __eou__ my present pay is rib 3 , 000 yuan each month . __eou__ what's your expected salary ? __eou__ what is important to me is the job and the people who i will be working with , so regarding salary , i leave it to you and i am sure that you will make me a fair offer . __eou__ i can offer you 5 , 000 yuan per month . raises are given after three months ' probation period according to your performance . is this satisfactory ? __eou__ yes , it is quite satisfactory . i accept it . __eou__ any question about the work ? __eou__ to whom should i report ? __eou__ the general manager of your section . __eou__ what are the benefits ? __eou__ we'll offer that on holidays . __eou__ i would like to know if there would be any opportunity to work abroad in the future ? __eou__ yes , we have inspection abroad . __eou__ thank you . then i think it's time for us to sign a letter of intent . __eou__ okay .
the smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow . can you draw up a schedule for them ? if they want to make any changes , minor changes can then be made . __eou__ is there anything special they would like to do ? __eou__ they would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products . besides , they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing . __eou__ that can easily be arranged . i will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them . anything else ? __eou__ they would also like to have a meeting with our designers . and this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention . __eou__ i will set it up . __eou__ they will stay for two days . try to work out an efficient schedule .
madam , i made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . i think there are something needs to modify . __eou__ which terms ? __eou__ first , about the terms of payment . your draft contract says that payment is to be made by d \ a . this is not our practice . we prefer to have the payment made by l \ c through a negotiating bank in america . __eou__ good . i will add this to the contract . __eou__ the second thing i would like to point out , that is packaging . it's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . but i think the wooden cases are much safer . __eou__ well , you are right . is there anything else ? __eou__ as far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . thank you very much . __eou__ well , we have agreed on all the major points .
here is the final draft of our contract . i'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade . __eou__ yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . however , let me take a close look at the final draft . __eou__ do you have some points to bring up ? __eou__ well , everything we've discussed seems to be here . __eou__ yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . are all the terms here satisfactory ? __eou__ i'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . what about the quality standard ? __eou__ it is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . it's complete . so would you like to sign the contract right now ?
we've settled price , order , payment , now i am calling to ask about package . how can we pack the goods ? __eou__ as a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . besides , i would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . __eou__ do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? __eou__ yes . as you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . this can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . __eou__ i see . why not use wooden cases ? __eou__ if you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . but cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . __eou__ oh , i know . does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if i insist on using wooden cases ? __eou__ perhaps . that will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . __eou__ then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . __eou__ that is guaranteed . each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . __eou__ sounds good .
good morning . what can i do for you ? __eou__ good morning . would you like to tell me something about the computer ? i've never seen this brand before . what is your superior brand ? __eou__ this is our new brand . i can make sure our computer board is one of the best boards . __eou__ can you tell me the specialty of your computer board ? __eou__ with pleasure . it's easy to have a memory expansion on board capacity and fulfill your needs for a computer . besides , there is more space for extra cards to expand later on . __eou__ what's the memory capacity of the computer ? __eou__ the hard drive has 260 g and the ram is 4 g . __eou__ can you give me a wholesale list ? __eou__ yes . the price differs depending on how many you want . __eou__ is the price negotiable ? __eou__ yes . it depends . if you have a large order , we will give you a discount .
do you work well under pressure ? __eou__ working under pressure is exciting and challenging . i don ’ t mind working under pressure . i work well under that circumstance . people can , i can . __eou__ do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? __eou__ no , nothing in particular . __eou__ how soon can you begin working for us ? __eou__ i need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . i will quit then transfer to your company .
may i see the manager of your office ? __eou__ i'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . can i help you ? __eou__ thank you . i am fred , coming from future clothes company . i've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes . i wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . __eou__ of course , he would . would you leave them with me ? __eou__ we are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . i think you will be interested in some of our new products . we always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers . __eou__ we're thinking of ordering some special styles of summer clothes . we should be interested in your products if they are of the styles we want . __eou__ as you know , we also take orders for clothes made according to specifications . __eou__ how long would it take you to deliver the orders ? __eou__ two months at most . __eou__ good . i'll send your catalogues to those who are interested . meanwhile , may i have an indication of price ? can i have your price-sheet ? __eou__ yes , of course , here you are . the prices are subject to our confirmation .
hi , bob , this is john lin . __eou__ hello , john . __eou__ i'm with hartford public relations . i'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services . __eou__ how about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?
i'm afraid i've a complaint to make , which is about the goods we ordered last week . __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ i will explain the problem briefly . we found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged . __eou__ really ? that's something unexpected . you see , all our exports are strictly inspected before shipment . the goods were in perfect condition when they left the port . __eou__ here's the survey report issued by the china commodity inspection bureau . according to the report , the damage was caused by poor packing . our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases . __eou__ our goods are well-examined before shipment . i'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route . __eou__ please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately . __eou__ we will check with the parties concerned right away .
any questions ? __eou__ when will i know your decision ? __eou__ can we get in touch with you by e-mail ? is this convenient for you ? __eou__ it ’ s quite convenient . __eou__ thank you for your interest in our company . __eou__ ok . thank you very much .
your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in shanghai , may i ask why you quit ? __eou__ i worked in a foreign representative office for one year . however , i leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . i found another job that was more interesting . __eou__ have you done any work in this field ? what have you learned from the jobs you have had ? __eou__ i have learned a lot about business know-how and basic office skills . in addition , i learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues .
what course did you like best ? __eou__ project management . i was very interested in this course when i was a student . and i think it's very useful for my present work . __eou__ do you feel that you have received a good general training ? __eou__ yes , i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university . i am currently studying finance at a training school .
what ’ s your major weak point ? __eou__ i haven ’ t been involved in international business , so i don ’ t have any experience . __eou__ what are you greatest strength ? __eou__ honest , hardworking and responsible . __eou__ does your present employer know you are looking for another job ? __eou__ no , i haven ’ t discussed my career plan with my present employer , but i am sure he will understand .
do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? __eou__ i know something about it . our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . __eou__ it takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so i can not bear it anymore . it is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . __eou__ is that true ? __eou__ definitely ! __eou__ if that information is exact , i guess our company is willing to promote someone .
how do you spend your spare time ? are you interested in sports ? __eou__ i have many hobbies , i like almost all kinds of sports and i also like to listen to pop songs . __eou__ do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ i think i am extroverted .
sorry , i overslept . my clock didn't go off this morning . __eou__ again ? __eou__ that's right , even though i did set the alarm last night . __eou__ your clock never works . perhaps you should buy a new one . __eou__ well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , i'll definitely buy a new one .
david , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ? __eou__ yes , i'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . and your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years . __eou__ so , i wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . if you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation . __eou__ to be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . i'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent . __eou__ as we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent . __eou__ sounds reasonable . i will tell my boss about you agent application . another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? __eou__ to be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , i think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year . __eou__ well . as our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ no , certainly not .
you know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . so , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? __eou__ we appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . but according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so i think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . __eou__ if that's the case , we can talk about it first . what's your concept of a big amount ? __eou__ i mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . __eou__ i'm afraid that's too much for us . __eou__ we know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . however , our company has the regulation for the agency . __eou__ all right , we accept the challenge . what about the commission ? you know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ i am sorry to say that it's a little higher . our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . __eou__ you may have known that we have competitors from south korea and other countries . at the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and tv programs . a 20 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ our price is worked out according to the costing . a 20 % commission means an increase in our price . so , i'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . __eou__ oh , that's pitiful .
have you finished that report yet ? __eou__ no . i'm still working on it . __eou__ how much time do you need ? __eou__ give me one more day .
last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? __eou__ yes , sir . most of us had positive review in last quarter . take fred and david for examples . both of them try their best to achieve the best . their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . __eou__ they are popular in and out of our department . fred is easygoing , while david is cautious in working . __eou__ all these say a lot for their characters . __eou__ so , i want to recommend them for a raise . fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and david to be director of office .
john , you have done a good job . our new series computer is appreciated by the guests . they intend to sign contracts with our company . you really did a good job . __eou__ thank you . i can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users . __eou__ hah , as the sale department director of our team , you are the best . __eou__ i am flattered . but i am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it . she asked me to her office . __eou__ why not ? you've done so well for the company . she should give you a prize . __eou__ i feel nervous when i face her . she looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time . __eou__ come on ! what are you nervous about ? __eou__ it is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation . __eou__ but the sale number is close to the predicted amount . __eou__ i'm still nervous . i don't know what to say to the manager . i always feel ill at ease in that kind of place . __eou__ take it easy . be confident . i'm sure you can do it .
i'm afraid it's a bad news for you . there are some problems in your supervised goods . __eou__ oh , no ! how did this happen . are you sure ? __eou__ i overheard this information when i passed arden's office . we got some complaints from consumers yesterday . i am terribly sorry for that . __eou__ my god ! i actually checked them one by one . how could this be ? __eou__ calm down ! it is useless to act like that . can we find some solutions ? __eou__ what kind of solution can i have now ? i nearly go crazy now . __eou__ but we still have to find one . can we find arden to check whether this is true or not ? __eou__ it seems that i have nothing to do , except this . __eou__ face the reality . maybe we can find the way to make up the loss .
excuse me , i want to know the price of your cpu . __eou__ glad to tell you . the price of cpu is 300 dollars . __eou__ it's rather too high . if you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously . __eou__ if you order a large amount , we can give you a discount . __eou__ well , can you explain it to me ? __eou__ the price of cpu is 260 dollars above 1,000 units . __eou__ can you reduce more ? __eou__ i'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . __eou__ in that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . please reconsider . __eou__ it is so hard to deal with . __eou__ if you can give us a more reduction , we'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ this price is the best we can make .
nice to meet you , sir . i come from new times clothes company . we learnt that your exhibits on the trade fair in shanghai this month were marvelous . would you please quote the price ? __eou__ before we discuss the price , may i ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ? __eou__ your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets . __eou__ can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? it is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity . __eou__ that is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets . __eou__ in that case , our offer for the white-collar series is us $ 200 , and the other is us $ 300 per set . __eou__ do you quote cif or fob ? __eou__ we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive . __eou__ what are your terms of payment ? __eou__ letter of credit at sight . __eou__ another question . could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ? __eou__ within a month after your letter of credit reaches us . __eou__ well , i got all the point . all the decision will be made since i get the approval from my supervisor . __eou__ ok ! i expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . we believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
i've come to hear about your offer . __eou__ we have the offer ready for you . let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in june . the offer is valid for five days . __eou__ i can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . __eou__ you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . __eou__ i am afraid i can't agree with you there . i must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . __eou__ but you must take the design and quality into consideration . you know we are superior to others in design and quality . we have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . __eou__ i agree that yours are of the top . __eou__ well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . __eou__ impossible . how about 5 % off ? __eou__ right . a reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
well , let's have your firm order . __eou__ yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , fob new york . you will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market . __eou__ your price is rather high . we cannot accept it . can you bring the price down a little ? __eou__ in fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . __eou__ i can't agree with you . we have quotation from other sources too . their prices are lower than yours . __eou__ but you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . in fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . you should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year . __eou__ it doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price .
we have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . now i am calling to talk about the terms of payment . what are your terms of payment ? __eou__ well . we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l \ c , payable against shipping documents . __eou__ i see . payment by lc is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept da or dp ? __eou__ i'm afraid not . that is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way . __eou__ what about the cost of delivery ? __eou__ we would like to do it in accordance with an f . o . b .
how about the repair fee ? __eou__ it's for free , because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years . __eou__ great ! when can your technicians come to our factory ? __eou__ they are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now . let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem . please wait a moment . __eou__ i've just contacted our technicians . they say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . can you tell me your factory's address , so they can find you easier ? __eou__ that's wonderful . i appreciate your efficiency and cooperation . __eou__ to provide the as excellent after-sales service is our motto . please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon . they will be there on time . __eou__ thank you again !

you are seemingly upset . what's behind you ? __eou__ arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . but i have no idea on the registering process . __eou__ that's not as complicated as you suppose . __eou__ is it so easy ? i never experienced this . can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ it is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . and we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . __eou__ based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? __eou__ correct . and our country follows the priority of use principle . __eou__ can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? __eou__ some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . so you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue .
what are you doing , janice ? __eou__ i am reading the book on patent and i think it will be helpful for my work __eou__ patent ? are you also learning something about patent ? __eou__ yep ! i heard that your company is registering a new trademark . __eou__ you are well-informed . can you tell me something about the patent law in our country from the book you are reading ? __eou__ i just read this in the whole afternoon . let me show you . __eou__ so coincidental . actually we can exchange some information on this problem . __eou__ the purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . the law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles . __eou__ is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ? __eou__ foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent . this task is usually taken by the patent agent department . __eou__ how long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your patent law ? __eou__ 15 years .
since china was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . one of these commonly used forms is co-production . would you please do a bit explanation of it , mr . walker ? __eou__ well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . they join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . __eou__ i suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in china . __eou__ not necessarily . it depends on the contract stipulations . they may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . __eou__ i think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . it's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , you are right . either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . in such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible .

what are your personal weaknesses ? __eou__ i ’ m afraid i ’ m a poor talker . i ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business , so i have been studying public speaking . __eou__ are you more of a leader or a follower ? __eou__ i don ’ t try to lead people . i ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together . __eou__ do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ? __eou__ yes , in most circumstances . __eou__ are you available for travel ? __eou__ yes , i like travelling . i am young , and unmarried . it ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently .

i was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . you provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . __eou__ it depends on the time of year . at peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . we also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . we run a very tight operation ! __eou__ do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? __eou__ sometimes we use a local employment agency . it depends on the job .

i've just got a new printer . how often do i need to replace the print heads ? __eou__ well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . it depends on the user , but about once a month is average . __eou__ so if i don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ? __eou__ that's right . it could last six months or more . this model's designed for heavy use . don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head .

could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? __eou__ well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . __eou__ so , is it actually paper at this stage ? __eou__ yes , it is . but we need to take out more water . so it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . after that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . the paper is then coated . and finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths .
how do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? __eou__ we try to recycle as much as we can . __eou__ what about the rest ? how do you get rid of it ? __eou__ we have to send it to landfill . it's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . __eou__ but doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? __eou__ yes , you're right , it does . but we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill
has your company been affected much by government legislation ? __eou__ yes , we have . we've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . __eou__ what about your use of raw materials ? __eou__ well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . __eou__ what happens if you exceed the limits ? __eou__ we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .

i heard nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . i also want to work there . __eou__ will this do ? your major is not related to banking , as you know . __eou__ i know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy . __eou__ money is not the only standard to decide your career . in fact , there are more important things you can refer to when evaluating your career . if i were you , i would choose one i like to do . __eou__ actually , i am afraid i will be stuck in the job forever , if i choose a bad one . __eou__ don't worry . we can always change our careers , when we are unsatisfied with them .

we have made some adjustment on the prices . and this is renewed price list . __eou__ thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . __eou__ this is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction . __eou__ if so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . __eou__ then what ’ s your counter-offer ? __eou__ this is our counter-offer . __eou__ we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . __eou__ so are we . our counter-offer is in line with the world market . __eou__ how about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? __eou__ agreed .
what do you think of our price ? __eou__ your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? __eou__ yes . we regret we cannot maintain our original price . since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__ i agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . __eou__ i don't think so . you must compare our price with that of other export houses . i'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__ i don't think we'll be able to pay the price . to have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__ i ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__ don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__ we've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__ is that all ? __eou__ yes , this is the best we can do . __eou__ i'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
i can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting a-l quality . __eou__ i've looked at your units , and am very happy with them . your goods are all far above standard quality . __eou__ we spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . we won't sacrifice quality for quick profits . __eou__ well , we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation . we can start the negotiations as soon as you want . __eou__ great , i'm glad we'll be able to do business together . i'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning . __eou__ fine . as well , would you mind if i asked to see the loyd's surveyor report of your products ? i may have a few more questions about your quality analysis .
how can i be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? __eou__ one of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . __eou__ but a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . __eou__ we have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . this means that no mistakes are made . __eou__ your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__ certainly . we provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year .

could you just run through the evacuation procedure ? __eou__ yes , of course . when you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible . __eou__ should we use the stairs ? __eou__ yes , don't use the lifts . we have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure . and always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading .
what should i do if i notice a fire ? __eou__ raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm . call security , say ' fire ' and give your name and exact location . at night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone . __eou__ should i try to put the fire out ? __eou__ if you discover a small fire , you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained . make sure you use the right extinguisher . they are all colour-coded and contain different substances to put out the fire .

how do you do ? i need your help in selecting a foreign market to invest ! __eou__ fine . i have your letter and i've made some notes . __eou__ how can i find out what countries to invest ? __eou__ we have quite a lot of import and export information and can give you figures on population , consumption , production , and foreign exchange reserves . __eou__ great . i want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries . __eou__ but you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions . you can get much information about environment of investment .
could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ? __eou__ our country is a free trade nation . she was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . but this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . __eou__ well , what about price ? __eou__ the price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . there are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance .
how many years have you done business with china ? __eou__ let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with hua mei of china import & export corporation in 2003 . __eou__ do you have any difficulties in doing business in china ? you know the chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ? __eou__ i don't think i have any problem with our chinese partners . they have always followed the contract strictly . we can do business directly with the corporation . as i mentioned before , the chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . __eou__ well , it's known that the sino-american relation is in a dilemma . does it influence your business in china ? __eou__ actually not at present . but we are afraid it will . you know policies influence business to some extent . i hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . china is really a large market . we don't want to lose it . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ you're welcome .

now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ? __eou__ as you know , we are in a very special time . this is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . i think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies . __eou__ what is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ? __eou__ once the us economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world . __eou__ what challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ? __eou__ we do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . it's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
jim , what do you think of that first interviewee ? __eou__ well , he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy . __eou__ okay , what about the first woman ? __eou__ she looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills . __eou__ all right , and what about the older gentle ? __eou__ he was very distinguished , maybe a bit over-qualified . __eou__ ohhhh . i hate this part of my job . __eou__ why don't you go over the resumes again ? they might help you decide who to hire .
how would you like this order shipped ? __eou__ send it by the fastest way . __eou__ are you going to ship this by air ? that might cost a little more . __eou__ how much ? __eou__ i'll check the costs and call you back . __eou__ ok .
your definition on success ? __eou__ most people think that wealth means success . but from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . on the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . the ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. with the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . and in toda / s society , if you have money , you seem to have everything . but this is not the case . i think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . it also means that you can get respect from others . __eou__ what ’ s your ideal job ? __eou__ ideally , i ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . i ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . i actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . but i realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and i have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . __eou__ how would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? __eou__ very good . basically , once our sales plan was put together , i had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way i felt best . __eou__ how would your present boss describe you ? __eou__ he always says i am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . __eou__ what would your colleagues say about you ? __eou__ they would say i am a dependable friend and a capable colleague .
and how would you describe yourself , miss tao ? what kind of person are you ? __eou__ well , as i mentioned before , i think i am easy-going . i enjoy working and talking with people and i'm a responsible person . __eou__ did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? __eou__ no . not at all . i'm quite easy-going . __eou__ what's your strong points ? __eou__ oh , i'm very responsible , i can make fast decisions , and i do not need much supervision . i enjoy completing challenging tasks . __eou__ what do you dislike most about your job ? __eou__ probably routine , dull work . oh , i am much more enthusiastic if i'm given a challenge and responsibility . __eou__ what kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? __eou__ a friendly one . i think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . an employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . __eou__ sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . are you sure you can handle this stress ? how do you deal with conflict in your present job ? __eou__ well , there's a lot of stress in a chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . i have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . if i have a problem with a co-worker , i do everything i can to work it out directly with that person . if i am unable to work it out , then i ask a supervisor to help out . if my boss shouts at me , i try not to take it personally . i try my best to understand the stress he is under . it's kind of like being in a family . often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . a company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . __eou__ how do you feel about overtime work ? __eou__ that's no problem . i know that every company has busy periods . when this happens , i'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . __eou__ what is most important to you in a job ? __eou__ i want to feel that i am making a real contribution to the company , so i would like my boss to trust me with important work . __eou__ do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ i'm quite outspoken . i enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . so i'd call myself outgoing . __eou__ under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? __eou__ seldom . but i hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . __eou__ ok . what are your strong points ? __eou__ hmm . as i mentioned , i can work well under pressure and i enjoy work that challenges me . i think that my english ability is also a strong point . __eou__ and your weaknesses ? __eou__ i think i sometimes try to be over-organized . so i am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job .

how do you get along with your boss ? __eou__ i had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . because i've had a number of bosses , i've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . it's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . my last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when i helped her accomplish her goals . __eou__ what do you think is important in your work ? __eou__ many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . but the most important , i think , is achieving results .

when you were in school , what were your favorite subjects ? __eou__ i enjoyed everything , as long as i was learning . __eou__ still , you must have had some subjects you enjoyed more than others . __eou__ yes , i did like spanish and music . but i don't remember much spanish . __eou__ that's too bad . we could really use someone who is bilingual . __eou__ if you hire me , i'll start studying spanish again .
steven , what's your idea of price ? __eou__ the best we can do is $ 120 per case . __eou__ i'm afraid that's impossible . you can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . __eou__ i think you are well informed about the prevailing market.some spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices . __eou__ price can't be separated from quality . a comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior . __eou__ it's true yours are of better quality . but your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . how about meeting each other half way ? __eou__ well , i'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes . __eou__ take your time , please .

can you read and write english and french ? __eou__ no , i'm proficient in both written and spoken english , but i can only carry on a simple conversation in french . __eou__ could you tell me something about your english education ? __eou__ my mother is an english teacher in a college , so i began learning english when i could speak , and i took english as my minor subject at university .
are there any special requirements on the project ? and shall we talk around it in details ? __eou__ yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . __eou__ that's a good idea . we can improve our technology to meet your special need . __eou__ and please let white color dominate . __eou__ ok ! i've noted it down . and any others ? __eou__ oh ! i've almost forgot the location was transferred to the a county in the east of the city . __eou__ i'll tell them . __eou__ well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . __eou__ please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . and we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . __eou__ thanks a lot . and i believe i'll have a good time working with you . __eou__ i think so . bye ! __eou__ bye !
even with volume sales our costs for the exec user won't go down much . __eou__ just what are you proposing ? __eou__ we could take a cut on the price . but 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . we suggest a compromise 10 % . __eou__ that's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . any other ideas ? __eou__ i don't think i can change it right now . why don't we talk again tomorrow ? __eou__ sure . i have to talk to my office anyway . i hope we can find some common ground on this . __eou__ robert , i have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . __eou__ i hope so , dana . my instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but i'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . __eou__ i understand . we propose a structured deal . for the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . __eou__ dana . i can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . __eou__ then you'll have to think of something better , robert .

china is now a member of world trade organization . as a member of to , china will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other to members . is it fair to china , do you think ? __eou__ it's a hard question , but i'm sure the reexamination of china's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . after the establishment of new china , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of china's economy . these policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both china economy and our domestic enterprises . after china's entry into to , chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . this new situation entails some changes of chinese economic policies . these changes will spur chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . __eou__ we can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of to agreement . this principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? __eou__ yes , it does . domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . i have found that although changes of china's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot to agreement-non-discrimination principle . such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of china's economic policies .
today , we have invited a special guest , prof . yang . he will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . your international legal advice is important to our business well being . please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . __eou__ the significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . despite many countries accession to to membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . however , these frictions will be better managed under the to trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . __eou__ in spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 __eou__ problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . for this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . the most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . __eou__ how can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? __eou__ yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . __eou__ as you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in asia . what is the current legal framework in the countries ? __eou__ the lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . however , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . this will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . __eou__ several years ago , the countries and china singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . __eou__ precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with to agreement .
what do you think of our price ? __eou__ your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? __eou__ yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__ i agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable . __eou__ i don't think so . you must compare our price with that it other export houses . i'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__ i don't think we will be able to pay the price . to have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__ i'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__ don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__ we've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__ is that all ? __eou__ yes this is the best we can do . __eou__ i'm sorry , we can't handle the price you offered .

( after about 15 minutes ) hmm , you've done a pretty good job . it's well prepared . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ well , i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . __eou__ that's a good idea . __eou__ first , let's read clause two about packing . it's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . that'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . so , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . __eou__ agreed . __eou__ for shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . so would you allow us to make partial shipments . __eou__ i understand your position .

how do you do ? nice to meet you , diane . __eou__ how do you do , jack . nice to meet you . __eou__ well , i think you ' ve reconsidered our proposal , diane . __eou__ yes , you are right . after all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . the only problem is price . __eou__ i should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . do you have any suggestion in mind ? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . __eou__ that's why i came to your office today . we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . __eou__ that's true . but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . __eou__ i see your point . that's to say s 611 each set . still it's much higher than the market price . could you see your way to reduce the price , jack ? __eou__ well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . that's the best we can do . what do you think of that ? __eou__ all right . we accept it . so $ 600 for each set . __eou__ very well . thank you .
alan , i believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . are you interested in some of our products ? __eou__ yes , i'm thinking of buying some t-shirts , but i find your price is on the high side . __eou__ i'm very surprised to hear you say that . i think our price is very favorable . you can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . __eou__ i'm not so sure of that . i think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . __eou__ what's your proposal then ? __eou__ i think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . __eou__ we could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . what quantity are you going to order from us then ? __eou__ as a trial order , i'll take 5,000 dozen this time . __eou__ 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . in that case , the best i can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . __eou__ that's really a big change from 20 % . i really can't accept that . __eou__ what's your counter-offer then ? __eou__ to conclude the deal , i'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . __eou__ 15 % is impossible . that'll leave us almost no profit . __eou__ if that's the case , i'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . __eou__ how about doing it this way ? you increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and i'll give you a l0 % reduction . __eou__ 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . __eou__ well , to encourage future business , i'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . we can't go any further . __eou__ ok . let's call it a deal .
we have made some adjustment on the prices , and this is renewed price list . __eou__ thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . __eou__ this is our rock-bottom price and we can't make any further reduction . __eou__ if so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . __eou__ then , what's your countr-offer ? __eou__ this is our counter-offer . __eou__ we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . __eou__ so are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market . __eou__ how about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? __eou__ agreed .
i had a look yesterday . i found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design . the exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . i have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . i have got some idea of your exports . i am interested in your silk blouses . __eou__ our silks are known for their quality . they are one of our traditional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . they are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand . __eou__ some of them are of the latest style . now i have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . we wish to establish business relationship with you . __eou__ your desire coincides with ours . __eou__ concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank.or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies . __eou__ thank you for your information . as you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . we always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . i have no doubt that it will bring about benefit between us . __eou__ that sounds interesting ! i'll send a fax . as soon as i receive the definite answer , i'll give you a special answer . __eou__ we will make an offer as soon as possible . i hope a lot of business will be put through between us . __eou__ so do i . __eou__ i hope everything will be smooth . __eou__ that is what i want to say . __eou__ i will give you the lowest price in the future . __eou__ thank you !
thank you . i'm very glad to be here . as ms . tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new ebb . as you probably know , ebb stands for electronic book player . our company put the original ebb on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both china and the u . s . __eou__ ms . yang , can you tell us in what ways the new ebb is better than the old model ? __eou__ certainly . first of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . so on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... __eou__ excuse me , but what are the mbps mainly used for ? __eou__ oh , there are many uses and i'll explain them in detail a little later . first , i'd like to ... __eou__ before you go on , ms yang , could you tell us if the original ebb sold well in the u . s . ? __eou__ you were right , mr . tim . your colleagues do want know all about it .

actually , i was wondering what we should do if either one of us would like to terminate the contract ? __eou__ well , as a rule , the contract will become void automatically , if both sides do not agree to renew it when time comes . __eou__ i got it , but nevertheless . what i was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up ? __eou__ oh , i am sorry . i misunderstood . well , in that case , the contract can be canceled with a 2 month's notice . what do you say ? __eou__ that sounds perfect for us .

what companies are stockholders in this company , do you know ? __eou__ yes , the main stockholder is international business machines corporation , namely , ibm for short . __eou__ what section would you like to work in if you enter this company ? __eou__ i wish to work in the planning department . __eou__ what type of work will you expect to do at first ? __eou__ i expect to operate computers . __eou__ what are your plans for the future ? __eou__ i wish to move up to higher positions with acquisition of more experience in the future . __eou__ how long does it take to get here from your home ? __eou__ it's a twenty-minute bus ride . __eou__ how long do you think that we can depend on your working here ? __eou__ i ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to . __eou__ you are single now , but what will you do when you get married ? __eou__ i ’ ve thought about that a lot . i know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . but i am hoping to make it my lifetime work . so if i get married , i will find some ways that i can continue my work . __eou__ do you think you will want to continue working here even after you ’ ve had a child ? __eou__ i think so . __eou__ what ideas do you have if we employ you ? __eou__ ever since i was a young girl , i ’ ve been clever with my hands . i ’ ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . if i could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , i would be happy . __eou__ do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? __eou__ no , nothing in particular . __eou__ if you are employed by us , how are you going to do your part of the work ? __eou__ i'll first get further information about our goals , ways , counterparts and management , etc . . then i ’ ll make my plan . and then i ’ ll go with all my effort to see it is realized . __eou__ if you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ? __eou__ i ’ ll report it honestly . i ’ ll give a correct analysis . i may quit the job - and pay compensation . but i have my way to judge whether i fail . __eou__ what do you think if you do not have much spare time on this job ? __eou__ people are supposed to work hard within regular work time , especially when it is an important work that is highly paid for . i don ’ t mind work over spare time if it is paid for . __eou__ what are your expectations from working on this job ? __eou__ getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . using my speciality in marketing and management . and getting advancement in salary and position . show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing . __eou__ if you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ? __eou__ i would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . he doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . but he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher . __eou__ if we do not employ you , what are you going to do ? __eou__ i will feel it is a pity . but i will not feel so bad . i will go for other interviews until i am employed satisfactorily . hopefully before i find another position , you will call me back .
mr . smith just called me back . __eou__ so ? __eou__ we got the contract ! __eou__ all right !

how about your interview ? __eou__ they turned me down . __eou__ why ? you are so excellent . __eou__ i think the only reason is that i was too nervous during the interview and i couldn't express myself the way i wanted to . __eou__ what a shame ! you should have showed yourself to them ! __eou__ it doesn't matter . i'll try other companies . __eou__ i suggest you hunt for a job on the internet . __eou__ on the internet ? i've never heard of it . __eou__ it's very convenient and it has become popular recently . __eou__ is that safe ? __eou__ of course , if you log on some standard websites . __eou__ thank you for your advice . i'll have a try .

you would be using mainly english in this job . do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ? __eou__ yes , i think i speak english quite fluently . i've often explained historical places in xi'an to foreign tourists in english . they say my english is quite good . __eou__ how many years have you been learning english ? __eou__ oh , more than ten years . i started learning english when i was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher . __eou__ well , perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it . __eou__ certainly .

i have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . may i ask why i was defeated ? __eou__ we have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences . __eou__ experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ? __eou__ yes , i think so . but how do you prove to me that you are more capable ? __eou__ maybe you can hire me on trial . if i'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go . __eou__ good idea .
look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . i ’ ve pushed the start button . it is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . what ’ s going on ? __eou__ let me check . it has a paper jam . __eou__ i didn ’ t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out . __eou__ be careful , the cartridge can be very hot .
hello , mr . hao . i am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . sorry . __eou__ although i am a little shocked , i can deal with it pretty well . i didn't perform as well as i should have in the interview . __eou__ maybe . but you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once . __eou__ ok , thank you , i'll try if there were other chances .
i am sorry to tell you that you failed in the job interview in our company . __eou__ it is tough to accept it , i mean . but can you tell me why ? __eou__ it is hard to tell . maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager . __eou__ i get it , and thank you for your honesty .
i am calling to tell you that you are hired by our company . __eou__ i really appreciate your offer , but i have to decline it , because i have already taken another job which i prefer to work in . __eou__ you are welcome , please call me if you change your mind . __eou__ i will . thank you .

i take care of the letters . i may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__ so you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__ yes , except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__ do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__ yes , and i check all the e-mails for mr . thomas .

how do i make a good impression in the interview ? __eou__ you should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . at least you should get yourself dressed up . appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . __eou__ anything else ? __eou__ don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest . __eou__ what do you mean by this ? you can ’ t do the two things at the same time . __eou__ appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big . __eou__ i see . __eou__ try to be natural , alert and interested . __eou__ you ’ ve given me very valuable advice and i have more confidence in myself now . thank you very much . __eou__ my pleasure . good luck to you .

hello , lucy , i heard you did a good deal in interview . __eou__ it's ok . __eou__ what did you do in the interview ? __eou__ i observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine . __eou__ are all these helpful for the interview ? __eou__ of course . the manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . for example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool . __eou__ anything else ? __eou__ you can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts , and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien .

what do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom ? __eou__ teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness , instead of taking their rights away from speaking . __eou__ what did you do to put it into practice ? __eou__ i divided students into groups and asked them to generate their own ideas actively . it can help develop the problem-solving ability of the students .
why do you want to be a teacher ? __eou__ it's a job i've been dreaming of since i was very little . i firmly believe that teaching is one of the most honorable jobs in the world . __eou__ in what department do you wish to work if we hire you ? __eou__ i want to work in the english department , as i am an english major .
how come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__ you mean the network connection ? __eou__ yes , i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response for any click . __eou__ i have the same question . i can ’ t send out mails . we ’ d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ ok .
a : look at this survey conducted by a website . a quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . hi , francis , what about you ? __eou__ well , i just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . anyway , i have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , i don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ but it is lucky for us . the company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . i have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ well , keep a low profile .
how are your chinese and english ? __eou__ i can confidently say that my chinese and english are pretty good . i won prizes in many speech contests in both chinese and english . __eou__ how would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ? __eou__ i believe every company has its own salary criterion . and you will give me a satisfying salary according to my abilities and performances .
why do you change your job and apply for a translator ? __eou__ this job is more challenging and i have longed to be a translator . that ’ s why i came here for an interview . __eou__ what do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator ? __eou__ i think one needs common knowledge , specific knowledge , and professional codes to be a successful translator .
hi , alan . i feel very nervous because i am going to have a job interview next monday . could you please give me some suggestions ? __eou__ sure . firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . __eou__ yeah , that is very important . __eou__ secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time . __eou__ i will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done . __eou__ i think you should make some preparations . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . what ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . __eou__ can i wear t-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? __eou__ you ’ d better not . informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__ i've got it . i think i will wear a white shirt with a tie . thank you for your suggestions .
brian , a company called me for an interview . __eou__ that's great ! you need to prepare for it . __eou__ how ? __eou__ get your hair done at a good hair saloon . tell them you are going for a job interview . __eou__ okay . __eou__ buy an expensive suit . __eou__ how expensive ? __eou__ the more expensive , the better . __eou__ i can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? __eou__ that'll do it . the best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . __eou__ how ? __eou__ if you know somebody at the company , ask them . if not , dark color will be fine . __eou__ is a white blouse okay ? __eou__ yeah , fine . and dressing shoes . __eou__ black ? __eou__ black is good . __eou__ white pantyhose ? __eou__ no . dark or skin colored . __eou__ jewelry ? __eou__ necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . but don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry . __eou__ how about make up ? __eou__ not much make up . __eou__ perfume ? __eou__ yes , some . but be aware that different people may like different scents .
do you have any sales experience ? __eou__ yes , i worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl . __eou__ what kind of work are you doing now ? __eou__ i'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company . __eou__ where are you working ? __eou__ i work at yangshi trade company ltd . i have been working there since 1997 .

did you see the woman that just left my office ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ she's another applicant , and a leading contender , but i didn ’ t want to hire her . she ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . we ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . and green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__ but it's the style now . __eou__ i realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__ of course . __eou__ well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . they want people who look more like yourself . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . when they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . they don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . __eou__ oh , i see . __eou__ we used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . but , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__ what happened to her ? __eou__ well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . she got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . __eou__ i see .

hi , george . i'm going to have a job interview next week . could you give me some advice ? __eou__ sure . first of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . __eou__ yeah , that's very important . __eou__ so you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . __eou__ i ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__ that ’ s right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . __eou__ it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . __eou__ it ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . __eou__ but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans . __eou__ i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__ it ’ s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes . __eou__ you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . __eou__ i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time . __eou__ you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . __eou__ it seems that ' clothes make the man ' . __eou__ it may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
what are you typing there ? __eou__ i'm working on my resume . __eou__ really ? did you find any information about a new job ? __eou__ yeah , i just got some good information off the internet . __eou__ great ! do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? __eou__ i didn ’ t just find out about one job . there were several ones that looked good . __eou__ maybe i should try looking on the web for work . __eou__ sure you have to be patient . but i think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . __eou__ but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . you might have no chance . __eou__ how do you know if you don ’ t have a try ?
what kind of jobs have you had ? __eou__ i worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then i transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . so i am familiar with the exile market in china . __eou__ how did your previous employers treat you ? __eou__ they treated me very well . we cooperated harmoniously and respected each other . __eou__ what have you learned from the jobs you have had ? __eou__ i have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager . __eou__ when you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ? __eou__ i prefered working with other colleagues when i worked in my previous company . i think teamwork and cooperation are very important . no matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can't do without them .
hello , pratt . how was your interview yesterday ? __eou__ hello , finn . i did a wonderful job and i was employed . how about you ? __eou__ i am sorry to tell you that i have lost the opportunity . __eou__ why ? you are so excellent . i think you are the most suitable person for the job . __eou__ yes , i know i am excellent , but i pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ ve told me . __eou__ what ? then what did you do ? __eou__ when i entered the room , i forgot to close the door . later , i couldn ’ t help smoking , you know i am a heavy-smoker . what ’ s more , i forgot to polish my shoes . there is some dirt on it . __eou__ you are so careless . you know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ’ t find a job . __eou__ yes , i know . and next time i must make good preparations . __eou__ good luck next time . __eou__ thank you .
are you here for the position advertised in china daily ? __eou__ yes , i am . i'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer , and hope to know a little more about it . __eou__ what kind of information would you like ? __eou__ well , first i would like to know if this position is still available . __eou__ yes , it's still open . __eou__ terrific ! then how should i apply for ? __eou__ oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . would you please send them to us by next wednesday ? __eou__ thank you very much . bye-bye .
miss wang , how do you do ? i ’ m allan james , the director of human recourse department of this company . __eou__ how do you do , mr . james ? thank you for asking me to come in . __eou__ not at all . please sit down , then we can begin . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ as you know , miss wang , we are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good english skills . we looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ today ’ s interview is for us to get to know a little about you . and the interview will last a little bit longer . so , if you ’ re comfortable , i want to ask you some questions .

are you married ? __eou__ yes , i've just married . __eou__ how long have you been married ? __eou__ i have been married for three years . __eou__ how many people are there in your family ? __eou__ there are four people in my family . __eou__ who are the members of your family ? __eou__ my husband , my mother-in-law , my daughter and i .
where do you live ? __eou__ i live in beijing . __eou__ what's your permanent address ? __eou__ my permanent address is apt . 401 , 238 zhongshan road , beijing . __eou__ where is your birthplace ? __eou__ my birthplace is suzhou . __eou__ where is your domicile ? __eou__ my domicile is beijing . __eou__ give me your telephone number , please . __eou__ ( my telephone number is ) 139xxxxx345 .
i think if i ’ m going to find a job , i ’ ll look over the job board . __eou__ well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section . __eou__ right , so i picked up a copy of the sunday globe this morning . __eou__ did you get a copy of the herald too ? __eou__ no , why should i ? the globe ’ s help wanted section is the best . __eou__ that ’ s true , but still the herald lists some jobs the globe doesn ’ t have . __eou__ not enough to worry about . why do i waste the money buying two papers ? __eou__ it's only a couple of dollars more . for that much money you can afford to risk it . __eou__ i guess you ’ re right . i'll get a herald as soon as i finish looking over the globe . __eou__ good idea .
hello . may i help you ? __eou__ yes , please . i've been here for nearly two months , but i still haven ’ t found a job . do you think you can find one for me ? __eou__ don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . will you please fill out this form ? __eou__ what ’ s this form for ? __eou__ this is for registration . after you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . and we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . __eou__ that's great . but how long do i have to wait ? __eou__ maybe several weeks , maybe several months . it's hard to tell . __eou__ oh , dear . how can i wait for such a long time ? __eou__ actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . __eou__ then , what do you think i should do ? __eou__ my advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . if you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . __eou__ i see . thank you very much for your advice . bye . __eou__ keep in touch .
i called about that ad we saw in the paper . __eou__ for the bank manager ? __eou__ that ’ s the one . __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ you were right , it was from a headhunter . he wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract . __eou__ well , no surprise there . __eou__ no ! not at all . but i did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . __eou__ great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? __eou__ i ’ m going there tomorrow . __eou__ great ! good luck . __eou__ and i think i'll look in on a few other employment agencies while i ’ m downtown , to see what they have . __eou__ good idea . the more people you ask , the better your chances are .
the boss announces the pay raise today , right ? how much do you think we'll get ? __eou__ no idea . your guess is as good as mine . __eou__ it better be more than last year . __eou__ well , anything is better than nothing . wait and see .

as an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? __eou__ rudeness . you are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . __eou__ and we should have good sitting posture . __eou__ that ’ s right . the ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . this is especially important in summer . __eou__ where should i put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? __eou__ put it beside you . don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . you've got long hair . don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . it gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . __eou__ i think that ’ s the reason why princess diana ’ s hair style became so popular . __eou__ also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . __eou__ i ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most westerners do . __eou__ as the saying goes , when in rome , do as the romans do .
i am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . but when i face a stranger outside , i get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . __eou__ you should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . speech is a reflection of personality , you know . you should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . __eou__ i will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . __eou__ your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . __eou__ i ’ m very shy . i think i might shake in my boots at the moment i meet the interviewer . __eou__ you ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . __eou__ another problem is that i dare not look into their eyes whenever i meet strangers , especially foreigners . __eou__ in china , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . but in western countries it is the opposite . eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . __eou__ is there anything else that i should pay attention to in an interview ? __eou__ yes . don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . if you do you ’ ll have bad breath . __eou__ i ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . __eou__ you should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . __eou__ i remember now . your advice is very helpful .
can you drive ? __eou__ yes , i have a driving license . __eou__ are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ one more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently . __eou__ that's fine with me . __eou__ would you mind relocating ? __eou__ as long as it isn't too far from this city , i don't mind . __eou__ it ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city . are you planning to find a boarding house nearby ? __eou__ i think i can commute that far without any trouble . __eou__ good . do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ? __eou__ no , nothing in particular . thank you . __eou__ then you'll need to know it's a hard job . you'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends . __eou__ yes , but i don't mind working hard .
i have a feeling you will get this job . __eou__ thanks . but i'm not so sure . interviews stress me out . __eou__ just remember to be professional and polite . oh , and don ’ t forget to smile . __eou__ i ’ ll do my best , but sometimes i have trouble being myself in stressful situations . __eou__ have you updated your resume recently ? __eou__ yes ... ah ! i forgot to include my e-mail address . __eou__ you ’ d better double-and-triple check it . you don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot . __eou__ i ’ ll be sure and do that . i also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . __eou__ definitely . oh , do you have a reference letter ? __eou__ sort of . i prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic . __eou__ i ’ m included on your list of references , right ? my praise of you could really make a difference . __eou__ sorry , you ’ re not on it . i don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing !
hello , nancy , nice to see you . __eou__ nice to see you , too . i heard you are a staff of nokia company . __eou__ yes , i ’ m satisfied with this job . __eou__ congratulations . what did you do during the interview ? __eou__ pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable . __eou__ how can i have the good external expressions ? __eou__ don ’ t worry about that . you just pay more attention to the details of people ’ s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language .

what's your working day like ? __eou__ i have a typical nine to five job . actually , i work a little longer than nine to five most days . __eou__ do you get paid overtime ? __eou__ no , i don't . i get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts i sign with clients . __eou__ do you have any breaks ? __eou__ we have an hour-long lunch break from twelve to one . we can take coffee breaks during the day . my boss doesn't mind , as long as we get our work done on time . __eou__ my boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . i suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ? __eou__ there's some paperwork , but most of the time we put the information into our computers . then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ yes , i do . i don't like it very much . __eou__ i work in a cubicle too , but i don't mind it .
can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ? __eou__ of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . you can have a look . we also have many other kinds of carpets . __eou__ the price seems acceptable for me . but i want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ? __eou__ of course we can . we can provide the quantity you ask for . __eou__ that's very good . shall we sign a contract now ? __eou__ no problem . let's check the terms of contract .
i think these patterns are quite good . can you give me a price indication of these ? __eou__ of course , it's my pleasure . we'll quote you the lowest price prevailing . __eou__ thank you very much . if your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract . __eou__ here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % . __eou__ very good . how many goods do you have ? __eou__ can you tell me how many goods you intend to order ? __eou__ we want to order 900 dozen . __eou__ the most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen .

we can offer you a 5 % discount . __eou__ your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . we can't buy with your offer . __eou__ well , what do you suggest then ? how about 8 % ? __eou__ when we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . if we are to place an order with you . i think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient . __eou__ what ? you want to drive me bankrupt ! you can't expect us to make such a large reduction . __eou__ there's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . __eou__ how about lo % ? this price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . __eou__ ok . i can settle for that .
we're considering of ordering 200 computers , but i'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer . __eou__ our price will be not less than $ 5000 . __eou__ your price is higher than i expected . could you give us a little discount ? __eou__ this is already our best price . __eou__ but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . __eou__ well , what would you suggest ? __eou__ could you make it $ 4500 ? __eou__ i'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . this is the best price we can quote . __eou__ can we meet each other half way ? __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ let's close the deal at $ 4800 , ok ? __eou__ you drive a hard bargain ! ok , that's a deal .
we are interested in your pure silk , but i'm wondering about the price . how much will you possibly offer us ? __eou__ it's $ 120 per yard including a 5 % discount . __eou__ that's much higher than i expected . can you come down a bit ? __eou__ but if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 % . __eou__ supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ? __eou__ maybe we would consider a longer credit period . __eou__ that would be nice . let's call it a deal .
we're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . but , there's one problem . __eou__ what's that ? i thought our negotiation went very well . __eou__ the only problem is the price . it's not possible for us to make any sales at this price . __eou__ $ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer . __eou__ i'm afraid i can't agree with you there . your price is much higher than other companies . __eou__ you get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable . __eou__ i don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . if you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . __eou__ sorry , i can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first . __eou__ all right , we'll wait for your answer .
strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? __eou__ we submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . they chose this one . __eou__ what's the advantage ? price , i suppose . __eou__ no , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . __eou__ what deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? __eou__ we can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . __eou__ you don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? __eou__ we do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . but kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . __eou__ i see . well , keep up the good work . see you later .
i'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to australia . can you do that ? __eou__ well , i haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . so i'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you . __eou__ all right , but i'm busy . how long will it be before you can finish the talk ? __eou__ i won't be too long , i suppose . just let me ring them , will you ? __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ thank you .
if i remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . __eou__ that's right . let's go into details of it . __eou__ ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of september . we'd like them to be ready in time for our christmas sales . __eou__ christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? __eou__ no . but in the united states , the christmas season begins about a month before december 25 . __eou__ well , i'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__ i hope you can try to get them to step up production . __eou__ they are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . __eou__ if that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . __eou__ i'm sorry . __eou__ what's your last word as to the delivery date then ? __eou__ by the middle of october . this is the best we can do . __eou__ all right . i'll take your words at that . __eou__ good . let's call it a deal . and we'll do our best to advance the shipment , but your letter of credit should be opened early september . __eou__ i promise .
hello ! is mr . green there ? __eou__ speaking . may i ask whom i am talking to ? __eou__ this is li with silk company . we met last sunday during the exhibition . __eou__ oh , yes . i remember your company . __eou__ thank you for visiting our products . i remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could i have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? __eou__ i'd like to , but i'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . __eou__ what about next week ? is it convenient for you ? __eou__ am . how about 10 a . m . on next friday ? __eou__ any time you say is ok . __eou__ all right , expecting you .
hi ! may i help you ? __eou__ thank you ! i am interested in your product . but i am not familiar with your corporation . __eou__ in fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions . __eou__ no wonder . __eou__ here is our brochure . it'll help you get acquainted with our products and company . __eou__ thank you !
to get around your difficulty , mr smith . i'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . you can send in an additional order later . __eou__ well , i'll consider the possibility . by the way , when do i have to open the l / c if i want the goods to be delivered in june . __eou__ a month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__ could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__ getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . you cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__ very well , mr zhang . i'll not reduce my order . i'll take the full quantity you offer . and i'll arrange for the l / c to be opened in your favor as soon as i get home . __eou__ when will that be ? __eou__ early next month . in the meantime , i should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . i hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my l / cb __eou__ you can rest assured of that .

i think we have everything in the contract . shall we sign it ? __eou__ wait a minute . i think we have missed an important point . we should include an arbitration clause in the contract . __eou__ i believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . __eou__ i hope so . too . but i still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__ all right . i agree with you . but where do we hold arbitration ? __eou__ i suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . __eou__ it sounds reasonable . the clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . if no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . the arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . __eou__ ok .
what shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? __eou__ you should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company . __eou__ shall we leave it to the brokers ? __eou__ yes . they usually do it . __eou__ do they charge for that ? __eou__ of course . in europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service . __eou__ is it the same in america ? __eou__ they do the work without charge to the importer . __eou__ it's part of their service , isn't it ? __eou__ exactly . __eou__ is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? __eou__ no , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment . __eou__ i see . by the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ? __eou__ you must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice . __eou__ i see . thank you . __eou__ you are welcome .
thomas , could you do me a favor ? __eou__ what's up ? __eou__ could you pick up mrs . david from ford company at the capital airport ? __eou__ why don't you go ? __eou__ i'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . he said he couldn ’ t come back to beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him . __eou__ i see . i'll do it for you . __eou__ thanks a lot . it ’ s very kind of you .
what certificates of technical qualification have you got ? __eou__ i have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate . __eou__ have you worked in a computer company before ? __eou__ oh , yes , i have . i worked part-time as a typewriter in a computer company when i was at college . __eou__ do you have any ideas on this work ? __eou__ in my opinion , it has a broad prospect and it needs smart mind . __eou__ good !

what do you think about our company ? __eou__ you are the leading company in the computer industry . __eou__ why do you think so ? __eou__ first , your overwhelming share in the world market . second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . third , the diversity in your production line is second to none . __eou__ in what business are you most interested in this organization ? __eou__ in particular , i'm interested in marketing in the domestic field .
have you had any experience with sales work ? __eou__ yes , i have . in fact , i had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where i established business ties with several firms . __eou__ what exactly did you do at that company ? __eou__ visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . __eou__ did you like your work ? __eou__ yes , i did . __eou__ but when and why did you leave the company ? __eou__ i left it two months ago . i didn't think i could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . __eou__ i see . why did you choose our company ? __eou__ i've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . besides , i grew up in a city in the northeast . i have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales .
where did you study accounting ? __eou__ i studied at anshan university . __eou__ did you intern anywhere ? __eou__ yes , i interned with an accounting firm during tax season . __eou__ that must have been stressful . __eou__ yes , but i learned a lot . __eou__ i'll bet . __eou__ i learned about different tax laws and how they work .
what does human resources department do ? __eou__ hiring , firing , training , insurances , benefits , retirement plans , salary , vacation . __eou__ they take care of a lot of things . __eou__ but most of time , they provide assistances . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ say if the engineering department wants to hire a person , they will request hr to find candidates . __eou__ yes ? __eou__ the engineering manager and his team will interview the candidates . hr will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits . __eou__ ok . __eou__ then the engineering manager will choose the candidate . __eou__ i see .

hey ted , i saw this ad in the paper . you should take a look . __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ it ’ s for a job . it looks perfect for you . __eou__ let ’ s see ...

mr . dick . does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? __eou__ yes . in fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . in the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . if your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . __eou__ but i find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . so i doubt its authority . __eou__ more and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . if your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . __eou__ could you tell me whether or not i send out my resume with it ? __eou__ it depends . if it has something special or useful , i suggest you send it out .

what is the great trait in your personality ? __eou__ i suppose my strong point is that i like developing new things and ideas . __eou__ so you may like inventive jobs . __eou__ yes , i like inventive jobs and i am capable and responsible .
please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__ well , all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__ what are they ? __eou__ they are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__ and what is the most important point ? __eou__ you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .
what are your plans for the future if you are hired ? __eou__ i'll do my utmost if i am hired . __eou__ do you have any short-term goals ? __eou__ no , that thought doesn't cross my mind .
are you a goal-oriented person ? __eou__ yes , i am . that's why i make plans before i do anything . __eou__ how do you plan to do your present job ? __eou__ i want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future .

decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . __eou__ of course . generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . __eou__ whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality __eou__ professional suits may be the best choice . __eou__ gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . __eou__ ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . it would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . __eou__ but those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . __eou__ name brand is not necessary . anything decent will be fine . __eou__ you should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . __eou__ only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . __eou__ in a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . __eou__ in other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials .
well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ? __eou__ most willingly . it's 600 dollars per ton . __eou__ that's a high price . __eou__ but you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . __eou__ i know . but i must say it's still unacceptable . couldn't you make a discount for me ? you see , we have such a long-term cooperation . and our business could be mutually beneficial . __eou__ ok . i can make a special offer for you . this price is based on careful calculations . and it is the lowest price we can offer to you .

brandy , i am supposed to participate in an interview tomorrow . __eou__ that's great . you need to prepare for it . __eou__ how ? __eou__ buy an expensive suit . __eou__ is a white shirt ok ? __eou__ yeah , fine . and dressing leather shoes .
excuse me . what should i wear if i want to go to an interview ? __eou__ you should wear a tie to go with your suit . __eou__ i am afraid i would tense up during the interview . __eou__ it doesn't matter . just do your best to sell yourself .
dm210 is equivalent to 400 rib . __eou__ don't you wish to employ rib of ours ? us dollars might be adopted . __eou__ are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ? __eou__ i will give you a definite answer on the price terms two days later .
peter , i hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . __eou__ i wish i could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . __eou__ i have cut the price the minimum . you know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . we could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . this price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . __eou__ people here desire medium-priced air freshener only . please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . __eou__ the low price i'm offering you is as low as i can go . __eou__ then , i am sorry to say i must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . __eou__ i'm sorry , peter . i hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . __eou__ yes . i'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you .

hey , michael . remember me ? i'm becky . we used to work at lemans together . __eou__ oh , sure . how are you ? long time no see . how are things at lemans ? __eou__ it's about the same . i've been thinking of making a change myself . do you mind if i ask you a few things about your job at the university ? __eou__ no , not at all . go ahead . __eou__ well , i was wondering what the salaries are like ? i mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ? __eou__ well , i can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at lemans . i just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . __eou__ yeah , that's what i thought . but , i've heard that the perks are better . i was wondering if that was really true . __eou__ i'd have to say yes and no on that . i don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like i did at lemans but i get to take classes for free if i want to . i've always wanted to get a graduate degree so i'm taking classes now to do that . __eou__ oh , that's great . it sounds like you're really happy with your move . __eou__ yeah , i guess i am . working at a university is really suits me .

we're sorry , but we cannot allow your claim . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ the material was not damaged by us . __eou__ we'll have to talk this over some more .
just whose fault is this damage ? __eou__ the order was in good shape when it left out factory . __eou__ it certainly didn't arrive here that way . __eou__ we'll make it right with you , of course . __eou__ how about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ? __eou__ what kind of price did you want ? __eou__ i was thinking of 30 % off . __eou__ that will probably be ok .
could i ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? __eou__ go ahead , please . __eou__ how long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__ you'll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__ what about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__ we will provide you with life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__ how often is the bonus ? __eou__ you ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__ do i have training opportunities ? __eou__ we provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__ well , i don ’ t have any other questions so far . i would like to think for a couple of days before i give you my final answer . __eou__ sure . i will ask lucy to call you in two days . __eou__ ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .

mary , this company is pretty good . i really want to have an interview . __eou__ have you made an appointment with this company ? __eou__ not yet . do i have to ? __eou__ yes , it's very important to make an appointment before the interview . __eou__ why ? __eou__ if you go to the company without appointment , the interviewers may happen to be busy with other things , and have no time to give you an interview . __eou__ yes , you are right . __eou__ if the interviewers are not in the company , you will go there for nothing . __eou__ sure . why didn't i think of that ? __eou__ so you should make an appointment in advance with the company for the interview . __eou__ then how can i make the appointment ? __eou__ you could directly call the company and arrange the time and place for the interview . __eou__ ok , i see . __eou__ if you succeed in doing that , you must attend the interview on time .
what should you do if you find out a man may has an illegal departure in exit control point ? __eou__ we can inform the department in charge and ask for revocation of passport . __eou__ what else do you need to keep him in temporary custody ? __eou__ we need a detention warrant .

mr . li , does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting ? __eou__ yes . in fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . the university and the business have a long-term relationship . if you are recommended by your university , you can be approved more easily . __eou__ but i doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same . __eou__ more and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort .

excuse me , i want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? __eou__ 15 dollars per dozen __eou__ oh , it's rather too high . we have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . __eou__ however , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . i can assure you that our price is the most favorable . a trial will convince you of my words . __eou__ if you can go a little lower , i'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ this price of yours is out of the question . you must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . __eou__ i hope you'll give a second thought to it . __eou__ we'll have to discuss the problem later . __eou__ what about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? __eou__ could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ? __eou__ about 300 dozens . __eou__ then , let me check . for the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , i think 13 dollar is our bottom line . and i can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays . __eou__ ok . that's a deal .
so how did your end-of-the-year review go ? __eou__ oh , it was okay . i had my meeting with mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks i need to show more initiative . he thinks that i need to start being more creative . __eou__ did he actually say that ? __eou__ well , not in so many words . but i know that productivity is a big issue for him . oh , he said the usual things like “ keep up the good work ” and “ thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . that , to me , means he's not satisfied with what i've been doing . __eou__ are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? __eou__ no , i don't . either i shape up or my job is on the line . __eou__ well , i think you may be overreacting . mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and i think that's what he was doing . __eou__ do you really think so ? __eou__ yes , i do . if you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing . __eou__ maybe you're right . thanks , don . i feel better . __eou__ i'm glad to hear it .

if i understand the terms correctly , the length of the contract would be one year with a one-year option . is that correct ? __eou__ do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training ? __eou__ i was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms . __eou__ yes and no . let me see if i can clarify that . the terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months . __eou__ could you elaborate on that ? __eou__ sure . what i mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing . __eou__ let me see if i have that right . this contract is for six months of training , but if it isn't cancelled , continues for another six months . is that right ? __eou__ yes , that's right . __eou__ okay , that's clear enough . let's move on to the other terms .

greetings should never be ignored in the interview . __eou__ sure . it is helpful to shorten the distance between you and the interviewer and create a lively atmosphere . __eou__ appropriate greetings will win the interviewer's favorable impression __eou__ but you should pay special attention to your words and attitudes . __eou__ in the beginning of the interview , greet the interviewer with a kind smile . __eou__ in the interview , use polite words , such as ' thank you ' , or ' please ' . __eou__ that's right . details can mean succeed or fail . __eou__ when talking you should focus your eyes on the interviewer in order to closely watch his or her expressions . __eou__ at the end of the interview , you should make your acknowledgements and say goode . __eou__ whatever the result is , you should keep your good demeanor . __eou__ only in this way can you leave a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__ in short , you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview .

we cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview . sometimes , my mind goes blank . __eou__ it is so terrible to be caught unaware . __eou__ admittedly , you can get prepared in advance for the interview , but you cannot cover everything concerned . __eou__ sure . so you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply . __eou__ firstly , your answer should go straight to the point , and be clear and brief . __eou__ state your opinion or argument first , and then go on with details . __eou__ never should you give an answer completely beside the point . __eou__ if you indeed don't know how to answer , admit it frankly . __eou__ pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule . __eou__ confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly . __eou__ try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can . __eou__ it can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer .

do you plan to further your study ? __eou__ yes , i have been always learning the economics on my own . my dream is to get a master's degree in economics . __eou__ if you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . the tuition fee will be financed by our company . __eou__ really ? it is amazing . i will apply for a position in your company .

i think we have had a very pleasant conversation , haven't we ? __eou__ yes , i think so too . __eou__ do you have any other questions ? __eou__ let me think ... i want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee . __eou__ i'm sorry we can't now . __eou__ i really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise i have to rent a house to live . __eou__ maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future . __eou__ that would work too . __eou__ anything else ? __eou__ some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees . will this company do so ? __eou__ i'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee . we only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company . __eou__ i understand . will the company provide training ? __eou__ yes , we will , and the staff will have a chance to travel every year . __eou__ that's great . thank you very much .

how much is your last salary ? __eou__ i have earned 10,000 a year including bonuses . __eou__ how much do you want us to pay you ? __eou__ i like to be paid more than that . hopefully , 150,000 a year . to be honest , i left the company to get more income .
acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview . __eou__ sure . kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment . __eou__ we often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable . __eou__ actually , that's not true . acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places . __eou__ we should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview . __eou__ in the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview . __eou__ don't forget to say " thank you " when you take a seat . __eou__ make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . __eou__ you can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way . __eou__ acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment . __eou__ finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again . __eou__ smiles and kind attitudes are the basics of acknowledgments .

could i ask the company for the housing ? __eou__ yes , but now we are fresh out of staff quarters . __eou__ how will you solve the problem ? __eou__ the company will assign you housing subsidies at 400 yuan a month .
body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image . __eou__ surely it is . __eou__ you should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him . __eou__ you can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words . __eou__ when you are seated , bent forward a little with your hands crossed , to show you respect the interviewer . __eou__ don't move from time to time . it is very impolite and will make you nervous . __eou__ proper posture can show your confidence . __eou__ the best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer . __eou__ pay attention to keeping eye contact as well . __eou__ throughout the interview you should maintain patience . __eou__ in a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview . __eou__ only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success .
when the interview finally comes to an end , the interviewee will probably breathe a sigh of relief . __eou__ still , you should not let down your guard . some details should be paid attention to . __eou__ at this moment you can thank the interviewer again for the opportunity of the interview . __eou__ you can also ask the interviewer about your performance today . __eou__ don't forget to ask when you can receive a reply . __eou__ and it's best to ask about the second interview if necessary . __eou__ you should state politely that you will wait for the results patiently . __eou__ you can ask questions about the position you are applying for . __eou__ in this case , you should remember to give thanks for the reply you get . __eou__ of course . __eou__ just say goodbye to the interviewer before you leave . __eou__ besides , remember to make acknowledgments through an e-mail or a call .
may i ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? __eou__ sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__ thank you for telling me that . __eou__ but remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__ what are they ? i ’ ll be careful . __eou__ don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . __eou__ i got it . __eou__ never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__ i see .

so , emily , how was your day ? __eou__ i don't think you really want to hear about it . __eou__ it can't have been that bad . go on and tell me about it . __eou__ to be honest , it was horrible ! my manager is such a pain in the neck ! __eou__ why ? what happened ? __eou__ well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! __eou__ that's not very fair . what did you do ? __eou__ there wasn't really anything that i could do . there's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . if i had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . __eou__ does he treat everyone in your department like this ? __eou__ he treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! __eou__ do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? __eou__ i really have no idea . all i know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! __eou__ is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? __eou__ not really . i'm hoping to live with it for a while until i get a promotion . __eou__ that's very sensible . it sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders . __eou__ i try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . __eou__ that's so true . when you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way .
i have some good news for you . we've decided we'd like to send you to shanghai on a business trip this weekend . __eou__ oh . __eou__ don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office foe a couple of days ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ i thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . everything will be paid for and i'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . all you have to do is to get on the train tonight at 7 pm . __eou__ the train ? will i be flying back then ? __eou__ oh , no . we've bought your return ticket for you . i think you'll find it comfortable . __eou__ will the train be very crowded ? __eou__ oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . __eou__ when is the first meeting then ? __eou__ they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9 __eou__ where will i be staying ? __eou__ we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . __eou__ that's very sensible . would it be alright if i left early today to prepare for the trip ? __eou__ that's not a problem . have a nap if you can . you don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip .
well , what did you think about the last candidate ? do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ she had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that i think a good manager needs . __eou__ what made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ she was a bit nervous , i guess . what else ? __eou__ when she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . i thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ you're right . if she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ it sure would . did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? she had horrible posture ! __eou__ i agree . i guess i was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ on top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space.she didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting . __eou__ that's true . i guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ don't worry , we ’ ll find someone eventually !
good afternoon , mr.stein . i wonder if you are free tomorrow evening ? __eou__ i'm not sure , but let me check my schedule ... ah , no . i have nothing then . __eou__ great ! our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the beijing hotel at 7:00 . here's an invitation card for you . __eou__ how nice of him ! i'll be delighted to go . but what time would be convenient ? __eou__ i'll be here to pick you up at 6:30 . __eou__ that's good . it's most thoughtful of you to do this , miss wood . __eou__ it's my pleasure . well , then , see you tomorrow .

what characteristics should an interpreter own ? __eou__ i think he should be an expert of everything . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language . therefore , an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he / she serves as an interpreter . otherwise he / she can not carry out his / her work smoothly .

that is what we are pursuing . __eou__ we look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations . __eou__ a meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff . __eou__ that will be good .

we're on the same team here , elvin . i'm being nice because we need to get along together . __eou__ i know you , zina . you're only nice when you want something . __eou__ if we want to beat webtracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . __eou__ to be honest , i'm starting to wonder if it's worth it . __eou__ you'd rather lose to webtracker than do things my way ? __eou__ you said it , not me .
dave , there's something i want to talk to you about . __eou__ zina , why are you whispering ? __eou__ i've been talking to webtracker . i'm thinking of jumping ship . __eou__ what ? are you serious ? you'd defect to our archrival ! ? __eou__ keep your voice down . we'll talk more later . right now i need to see vince . __eou__ we definitely have to talk , zina . and watch your back . elvin is still mad about his nose . __eou__ ok , but don't tell anyone what i said .
i can't stand the stupid guy any longer . it's unbelievable . __eou__ oh , my dear lady , take it easy . you should forgive a green hand like him . __eou__ he does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . __eou__ i suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . __eou__ i've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . __eou__ maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss . __eou__ oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . __eou__ just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . make sure you won't lose your temper ! __eou__ oh , so bad . i'm afraid i'll change the image of myself . __eou__ no , it's unnecessary . just respect the staff and their own opinions . __eou__ but sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless . __eou__ oh , no one is perfect . __eou__ that's right . i should speak to them in a polite way . __eou__ we have the equal partnership in team . __eou__ thanks very much and you're very eloquent . __eou__ thanks for saying that .

hey , benjamin , have you finished your report on the project ? __eou__ not yet . to tell you the truth , i don't know how to write it . i've considered it for several days . __eou__ what ? man , you don't know how to write a project report ? that's sounds a little bit ridiculous . __eou__ don't laugh at me , please . i'm serious . i've never been required to write this kind of report before , i only do the research reports . __eou__ oh , sorry , i've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . __eou__ so what items must be involved in this report ? __eou__ first is your final conclusion on your work of this year , and then comes your plan for the next year . __eou__ yeah , is that all ? __eou__ let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events . __eou__ that's too complicated . __eou__ and only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report . __eou__ oh , my god , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that i just need to fix my information in ? __eou__ i'm sorry . there isn't . because different people have to write different kinds of reports . __eou__ but i don't know how to work the microsoft words . could you please give me a hand ? __eou__ ok , no problem . but you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time .

good.now what kind of job do you want ? mr.wilson ? __eou__ i don't mind really.perhaps a job in a shop or a factory . __eou__ well , i know brown's biscuit factory are looking for a porter.they pay $ 200 a week . __eou__ that sounds all right . __eou__ good.now here's the address of the factory.the manager's name is ...
no , dave . i haven't wrecked my jeep . i'm calling to offer you a job . __eou__ with invoking ? no , thanks . __eou__ i'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building . __eou__ i'm not interested , zina . __eou__ don't play hard to get . the pay is good . you'd be working with elvin again . __eou__ i don't think so . __eou__ elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about .
hey , ken ... i need to talk to you . __eou__ sure ... what's up ? __eou__ can we step into the conference room ? this is a more private conversation . __eou__ sure ... __eou__ ok ... i'm just going to lay it all out on the table , what do you think of vincent's management style ? __eou__ well , vincent has only been ceo for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... __eou__ i don't want to put you on the spot . here's what i'm getting at , i don't think vincent is the man for the job . __eou__ really ? and what led you to this conclusion ? __eou__ as i see it , he lacks the proper vision . his style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.he ' s treading water instead of swimming . __eou__ well , i confess i've had my doubts about his abilities before . it seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . __eou__ i've been with this firm for 26 years and i'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__ me too . but what can we do ? this isn't a reality tv show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__ yes and no ... we can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . __eou__ interesting idea . you might be on to something .
but how did you know i was working for webtracker ? __eou__ when i was in la , i met the webtracker sales rep . __eou__ he couldn't have told you . only a few people at webtracker know about me . __eou__ the sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . he said everybody at webtracker used them . __eou__ i can't believe it . i can't believe i fell into your trap . __eou__ we both may be snakes , dave , but i'm just better at it . among the snakes , i'm the sneakiest .
ok , let's find somebody then . __eou__ good . i'll take care of it . __eou__ wait a second , vince . you know what ? why don't you let me handle it ? __eou__ are you sure ? do you have somebody in mind ? __eou__ yeah . let me see if he'll do it , and i'll get back to you . __eou__ ok . just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with elvin . __eou__ don't sweat it . i know just the guy .
come again ? what are you talking about ? aren't we on the same team now ? __eou__ guess again , dave . i have no intention of leaving invoking . never did . __eou__ what do you mean ? you didn't ? oh , no ... no ! __eou__ that's right , dave . i tricked you into giving a confession . and i've recorded every word of it . __eou__ but how ? so you knew all along i was with webtracker ? how did you know ? __eou__ i saw your green post-it notes . nobody else has them .
do you want to know what really motivates vince to be nice to me ? __eou__ ok . what ? __eou__ it isn't gratitude . it's fear . vince is afraid i'll jump to a competitor . __eou__ you wouldn't do that . would you ? __eou__ i might . vince knows he needs to keep me happy . __eou__ what about your accounts ?
i think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music . __eou__ you do ? how are you going to contact him ? __eou__ i'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen . __eou__ what does it say ? do you think he'll see it ? __eou__ he'll see it . it says , i like sweets . meet me at two thirty in the parking lot . __eou__ can i spy on you guys from the window ? __eou__ no . but i'll fill you in later . right now i have to find vince .
hi , dave . you're early . __eou__ so you knew it was me ? __eou__ i had an idea . __eou__ look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , i want to talk to you about webtracker . __eou__ i'm sorry . i know you feel betrayed . __eou__ so you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to webtracker ? __eou__ my mind is made up .
my accounts go where i go . vince knows that . __eou__ wow . you are a real snake . __eou__ it's business , dave . __eou__ i know , i know . kill , or die , right ? __eou__ right . the faint of heart should not apply . __eou__ i really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . __eou__ so do i .
hi , zina . lots of people are looking for you . __eou__ like who ? __eou__ like elvin . he isn't too happy about what you promised stars.com . __eou__ i've got it under control . __eou__ you do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? __eou__ what if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? __eou__ that would definitely make a difference . but vince already said no .
is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ? __eou__ that would be webtracker . we're heard they're almost ready . that's why we have to finish first . __eou__ or they'll take over the market before we even get started . __eou__ right . and that would be a total giga-bummer . __eou__ i guess we'd better get back to work .
who has been here already this morning ? __eou__ well , vince dropped off some sales reports for you.said you signed a big deal with homesupplies.com . __eou__ they're small fry . tonight i'm going to la to negotiate with stars.com . that'll be big . __eou__ you're right . all the entertainment web sites follow stars.com . __eou__ who else has been here ? __eou__ elvin stopped by to see me . __eou__ elvin ? which one is he ?
vince . we're both busy , so i'm not going to beat around the bush . i need a raise . __eou__ i can't do that , zina . you know i can't . __eou__ bull . i're done my research . i know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . __eou__ who told you that ? __eou__ that doesn't matter . i want at least 4 percent .
i guess i'm just a little nervous . i'm giving everything i have to invoking , and ... __eou__ and what if it doesn't work out , right ? __eou__ exactly . __eou__ you need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . you know how i know ? __eou__ how ? __eou__ because i won't let it fail . __eou__ but what about tomorrow ? what if stars.com decides to go with webtracker , and not us ?
i'm really confused , zina . will you explain all this to me ? __eou__ look , we need to have the stars.com account , right ? __eou__ yes . if we get it , we'll really be set for success . __eou__ and to get it , we have to beat webtracker to the punch . __eou__ ok , i'm with you so far . __eou__ that's why i promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week .
hi , jeny.are still working ? __eou__ hi , nacy.come in please . i'm just putting away on my books . __eou__ so , you are leaving , aren't you ? __eou__ yes , i'm going to take a holiday tomorrow . __eou__ how nice ! i can see you are busying packing . i'm sorry to interrupt you . __eou__ that's all right . i'm almost finished.do you need my help ? __eou__ yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? __eou__ oh . all right i'll read it soon . __eou__ excuse me for taking your time . __eou__ it's nothing navy .
excuse me sir.may i come in ? __eou__ mike , you're late again . __eou__ i'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so i __eou__ do you think i believe the story like that ? __eou__ but it's true . __eou__ how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? __eou__ that's coincidence 。 __eou__ ok , hold it . remember to be punctual next time 。 __eou__ i promise i will . __eou__ you'd better .
jack ! you've really done it this time . __eou__ what ? what happened ? __eou__ i told you to get this consignment out last week.we can't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs , can we ? what am i going to do with you ? __eou__ please , give me one more chance . i'll never let it happen again . i'm very sorry . __eou__ well , i guess i could give you one more chance , but this is the last time.in themeantime , i hear that tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ? __eou__ um , me ? __eou__ bingo !

billy , you are late again . __eou__ i'm sorry i'm late . i overslept . is the manager here today ? __eou__ yes he ' s in his office . __eou__ oh , i hope he didn't notice me . __eou__ don't take any chances . it'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . he's already mad at you for last 2 times . any more and he might fire you . __eou__ you said it . it won't happen again . do you really think he'd fire me ? __eou__ i think he might . you'd better go to his office . __eou__ you are probably right . i'll go right now and apologize . i try hard not to be late but it is difficult with beijing traffic . __eou__ good luck !

ok , so now the last point on our agenda . jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . __eou__ great . well , the main issue here , as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof . __eou__ let ’ s see ... these numbers are off the charts ! what's going on here ! __eou__ well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . look at these bills for example . just this month we ’ ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! __eou__ ok , thank you . i ’ ll look into it . __eou__ the list goes on and on . here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! __eou__ thank you , that will be all . i ’ ll take care of it . __eou__ look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called ” wild things ” ? ! __eou__ ok , i get it ! ! thank you for your very thorough analysis !
how do you think the report i wrote ? __eou__ not bad . but there is more room for improvement . __eou__ i jumped the gun . __eou__ there were some gaps in your report . please be more sorrow . __eou__ yes , i overlooked some facts . i ’ ll be more sorrow .
how can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? __eou__ with the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . __eou__ i guess this is a good excuse to surf the net on someone else's dime . __eou__ who'd have thought bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? __eou__ he must have just got online for the first time last week . he still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
so vicky , how long have you held your present position ? __eou__ i ’ ve been a secretary for two years , before that i was at university . __eou__ and how do you like working for ibm ? __eou__ it ’ s challenging , i feel i have learned a lot . __eou__ what ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? __eou__ i get along well with people , and i enjoy working with others . __eou__ that ’ s good . we always need team players here .
could you give me an expense report ? i would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . __eou__ here you are . do you need glue ? __eou__ that is very kind of you . i ’ m just running out of glue . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
i met a girl in elevator this morning . she works in a company upstairs . she said she envied the casual way we dress for work . she complained about the dress rule in her company . it requires everyone to wear formal clothes from monday to friday . __eou__ well , i was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . now , i know the answer . __eou__ you know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__ to some extent , it is . anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__ but it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . if they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .
how do i submit an expense report ? __eou__ you need all your receipts for reimbursement . __eou__ you mean i have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? __eou__ yes , here is the form for an expense report . fill it out and give it to me . i ’ ll get it signed for you .
let ’ s call it a day . __eou__ it ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . but now it ’ s the evening rush . __eou__ it ’ s hard to commute a long way . __eou__ sure it is . i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam .
are you familiar with the office management ? __eou__ i have done something like that before . __eou__ are you still interested in it ? __eou__ i think i am . i left the job only because it was too far from my home .
did you sign up for the picnic party ? __eou__ yes , of course . i love the picnic party . it ’ s really family fun time . __eou__ this time you can bring your daughter with you . __eou__ right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . __eou__ there are times of games planned , should have a grand time .
we need to know whether you have the special training . __eou__ actually , i received that kind of training when i was in college . __eou__ how about your experience ? __eou__ i worked as a pr clerk for one year
we need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances . __eou__ i used to hold a similar job for six years . __eou__ so you're quite confident in your experience and skill __eou__ i think so .
may i have your resume , please ? __eou__ yes , i need a job that can give full play to my skills . __eou__ do you like a job in a library , working with books ? __eou__ i like peace.as a matter of fact , i once had a job in a library .
one thing i love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . __eou__ really ? how can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__ he just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__ well . this must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . you know how tough it is . do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? __eou__ actually not ! our company pays for performance . __eou__ i like this system . it will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work .
congratulations , francis . your hard working finally pays off . i am so happy for your promotion . __eou__ thanks , monica . without support from you and other colleagues , i would not have made it . __eou__ i hope i could get promoted some day . tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__ well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . they might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . you learn more from that actually . sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__ how do you think if i volunteer for some work ? __eou__ i think it is a smart idea . our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . in view of your achievement , i trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__ i am so happy to know that i could make some contribution to our company . __eou__ this title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__ thank you , i will be doing my best .
my computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__ if you want to speed up your system , you ’ ve got to clean it up first . __eou__ how ? __eou__ you need to free your disk space . the simplest way is to use a disk-cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . things should be fine next time you start . you also need to control what starts up . there is a program calls start-up delayer , it can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after windows boosts . for example , you can choose to set your fox mail program to load 30 seconds after windows starts up . __eou__ very useful advice , i will try them right now .
you have been doing a great job this year and i am very satisfied with your work . __eou__ i am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company . __eou__ based on your contribution , i would like to give you a pay raise . your monthly salary will be increased by 800 yuan . this increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living . __eou__ i really appreciate it . thank you .
could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? __eou__ sure . any specific reason i should know about in case people ask where you are . __eou__ i have to see the dentist . we have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . so if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . if there is something urgent , tell them i will be back in two hours . __eou__ no problem . good luck . __eou__ yes , i will need it . thanks .
hi , lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ thank you for saying so . i don ’ t know , probably because i like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . i think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__ sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . people may think you are telling them how to do their work . if they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ that is true . some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . for example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . to show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ you are quite right . thank you for sharing your experience with me . i learned a lot . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
you look really wiped out ? __eou__ i had meetings back to back all morning . and phone rang off the hook from the minute i walked into the office . __eou__ not a good day . i hate to tell you that mr . thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . __eou__ i can ’ t believe it . i guess i ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight .
could i ask you for a favor ? my laser printer is out of ink and i need to print out something urgent . if you don ’ t mind , i would like to send you these files . could you then print these for me ? __eou__ sure , just send me through internal mail . __eou__ thanks , vivian . __eou__ no problem at all . welcome .
hi , still in the office ? it ’ s already 7 . __eou__ i would like to go but i have to finish a very important presentation . our boss needs it for tomorrow ’ s morning meeting and i was given the complete information only late this afternoon . __eou__ sounds like our boss . typically him always late with important information . anything i can help ? __eou__ oh , that will be great . thank you so much . please help me to double-check the name list . i have to make sure they are all correct . __eou__ ok , shall i make a coffee first ? __eou__ not for me . it is already late . i can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late .
hi , francis , morning ! how are you doing today ? __eou__ i had a bad start of the day . i was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and i missed my morning meeting . __eou__ indeed , i agree that is not a good start . how about the meeting ? you missed anything important ? __eou__ it is ok . my boss briefs me later on . __eou__ was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? __eou__ err , kind of . you know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days .
did you punch in ? __eou__ yes . by the way , you are having a great make-up today . i like the color of your lipstick . so adorable ! __eou__ really ? it took me really a while to find the color . i am happy you like it . __eou__ well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? __eou__ sure , when those never ending meetings .
hello , mr . thomas . could you spare a minute ? __eou__ what do you need ? __eou__ i need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__ he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . every time i go through my book of business cards , i will notice it . it is an eye-catching one . __eou__ wow , fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal . __eou__ yes , it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__ i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
congratulations ! i heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . __eou__ thank you . i am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . you know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . __eou__ sure it is . this is a changing world . does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? they are very useful for us . __eou__ yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . __eou__ well , good for you . i hope you can get what you want from the training . __eou__ i will do my best .
what is your most preferred training method ? __eou__ well , i prefer active rather than passive training . for example , i like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . they sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . all employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . we had a lot of fun learning together . it helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__ well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__ of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__ that ’ s boring . once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video .
have you heard that we will have reorganization ? __eou__ no , really ? __eou__ yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . __eou__ who will be there ? __eou__ james is going to be packed off there . __eou__ that is good . he can leave you alone this time .
the boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , i feel really down . __eou__ what ’ s up ? __eou__ well , actually i failed to meet a deadline last week and i forgot to answer an e-mail for a vip customer yesterday . __eou__ anything that distracts you from work ? __eou__ yes , everything . i feel overwhelmed by the daily work . sometimes , i just can ’ t focus on what i am doing . what is worse , though i make plans for a whole week , i always have to make changes later on because other things come up . i can ’ t manage my time well . i can ’ t handle work well . i am afraid i was screw up more things . __eou__ look , lucy . things are not so bad as you said . this is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . you need to relax a little . don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? __eou__ well , i will try .
how do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? __eou__ if i were a manager , i would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . it is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . __eou__ exactly , i overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , i guess . they were only three of us in the elevator , i felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . __eou__ well , i guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . __eou__ sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way .
some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . people spend so much time at work . it is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__ if we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__ beneficial ? i don ’ t think so . if two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . if they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . by any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__ but if two employees are in love , they will be happy . happy people are more productive . if they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . it can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__ i doubt that .
how would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ we have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ what do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations .
i am thinking about resigning from my current job . __eou__ have you thought about it seriously ? __eou__ yes , i have been thinking about it for quite a while . now i finally make up my mind to leave . i have given my resignation letter to our boss last friday . __eou__ ok , did you find a new company ? __eou__ yes , i will move on to xyz company . __eou__ good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . it is so nice to work with you . __eou__ thanks . i had learned so much from you and our colleagues .
what is the most enjoyable part about your job ? __eou__ i think meeting people . there are people from all over the country , all over the world , all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job . __eou__ what do you find annoying ? __eou__ well , i work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . and if something important comes up , i ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening .
hello , this is francis from xyz company . i would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . do you have time to meet ? __eou__ well , i am not sure . lets me check my agenda __eou__ ok . __eou__ i am free on tuesday afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm , is it convenient for you ? __eou__ it is ok with me . so i will be arriving at your office around 2 fifteen pm . do you have a projector in your room ? i would like to show you some related charts __eou__ yes , there is . see you then .
can i ask for leave this afternoon ? __eou__ what is the problem ? __eou__ i had a headache this morning . i didn ’ t pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i didn ’ t sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . maybe it is the migrated . __eou__ it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . __eou__ thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don ’ t have this too often .
i would like to ask for one day off next week . do you think the manager will agree ? i know it is the busy time for our company , but i do have some important things to handle . __eou__ well , it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__ actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i've got to be there , right ? __eou__ yes , you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__ thank you so much .
you must be very busy these days . i heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . it can be the most important meeting for our company this year . __eou__ sure it is . i am up to my ears as time expressed . __eou__ do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? you remember ? i like that one . __eou__ if we were in the same conference room , i would not work late these days . that conference room has been booked out . this time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . so everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . __eou__ good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . i am sure that your hard work will pay off .
what sort of job would you like to take ? __eou__ i prefer a sedentary job and i used to work as an operator . __eou__ we need an operator now . __eou__ it's just the job i've been searching for .
you must like negotiating a lot . people are saying , you are a super negotiator . __eou__ ha , i am flattered . actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . you just need to understand how it works . __eou__ i am not good at it by any means . give me some advice . __eou__ well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . understand his need and the cost for his need . and then you work together to find a solution . __eou__ sounds easy . but how can i apply to practice ? i am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . but i am afraid our boss will turn me down . __eou__ ok , as john after kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate .
i am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . we just made a record sale this season . __eou__ that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say , the r & d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . __eou__ it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ? __eou__ that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers , young people will love it . __eou__ certainly .
here is the document you asked for this morning . __eou__ oh , you are so efficient . i thought you might give it to me tomorrow . thanks . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . you know , these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . the more i think about it , the more i hate myself for being so disorganized . i decided to change the situation as soon as possible . otherwise i will be more regretful later . __eou__ this is encouraging news , good for you ! what is your solution , then ? __eou__ the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__ sounds not bad ! better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . it is about focusing on the right things to do .
hi , monica , congratulations ! your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . and it was so persuasive and i bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . you really made a big contribution to our company . __eou__ thank you , i just tried my best . i am very happy to know you like it . __eou__ you must have been prepared for a long time . some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? __eou__ well , yes . several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . they are very supportive . i consulted an economic expert last week . he was very kind to give valuable suggestions . __eou__ now , the effort pays off . you have accomplished something . __eou__ come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . i took the job because i love being challenged . but i can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people .
do you want to sign for a korea language class ? __eou__ what for ? oh , i see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the south korea market . __eou__ right , we have located a business partner in seoul . the first contact proves to be successful . the general manager of south korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . i think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . __eou__ well , sounds promising . but i think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . we need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . __eou__ a slow sparrow should make an early start . you know , i am not quick at learning any language .
which job do you prefer , an accountant or a secretary ? __eou__ neither , i prefer an active job . __eou__ then how about a salesman ? __eou__ that's better . i like travelling .
i really like what you have . but the price for this product is much higher than we expected . i am absolutely not a buyer at that price . __eou__ i know it is not the cheapest on the market . but if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . this device is built in with the most advanced technology . every aspect has reached the international standard . it is a worthwhile investment . __eou__ i understand that . if you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__ well , the best i can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . that is our best offer . __eou__ err , well , i can ’ t decide right now . do you mind if i have a small internal discussion on this first ? i will tell you our decision this afternoon . __eou__ sure , no problem .
is the view going to be ok ? __eou__ don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . __eou__ i ’ ll do my best . __eou__ that ’ s the way to go .
i ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . __eou__ it ’ s my pleasure . i enjoyed working with you . __eou__ i wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . __eou__ then keep up the good work .
are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? i'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project . __eou__ tomorrow morning ? what about tomorrow afternoon ? __eou__ then i'll see you in the afternoon . __eou__ ok .
i think you should look over these figures again . there are some calculations that are a bit off . __eou__ i apologize . this should not have to be this way . __eou__ apology is accepted . try to do better next time . __eou__ of course , i should have been more careful . i ’ m sorry .
we did a survey on your job performance . __eou__ how did i do ? __eou__ not so good . lots of complains . __eou__ really ? i thought i was doing well . __eou__ your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . i hope i ’ ve made my point .
i'm really in a flap about the interview . __eou__ take it easy.you ' ve made enough preparations . __eou__ i'm in such a need of the job that i can't afford any mistakes . __eou__ i'm sure you'll pass it .
hi , are you busy ? __eou__ hi , i was just coming to see you.but since you made the trek to my office , you get to go first . __eou__ okay , i'm putting together a report on the allied marketing co . failure , and i seem to have run into a stone wall . can you help me out ? __eou__ well , i can try , what do you need ? __eou__ you were there when the problem started . i was hoping you could fill me in on the details . __eou__ sure , no problem.but i need something from you . __eou__ name it . __eou__ i'm supposed to have this package ready for mailing out tomorrow morning and i'm miles away from being ready.can you edit this product study i wrote while i do these ? __eou__ all right , i can do that , and as soon as we finish this , we can both work on my problem . __eou__ that works for me . __eou__ give me the study . i'll start as soon as i get back to my office . __eou__ here's a print out of the study , and this is a disc with the full report on it.the file name is product study , this is and extra copy so you can do whatever you want with it .
well , that's why you'r here.my source for big tv sets overcharged me on the last shipment , so i need someone new . i wanted to meet you to see if we can work together . i think __eou__ i agree . __eou__ fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ? __eou__ i guess you're right.but like you said , you called me here to check me out . i've been doing the same . __eou__ ha , ha , ha ! that's fair.how did i do ? __eou__ quite good , actually . i'm pretty sure you're demanding , but fair and honest . i feel we can work together . __eou__ good , well , here's what i need from you . are you ready ? __eou__ shoot ! __eou__ well , i know you work for someone else , but as your client , please , we have to get this straight between us . i'm your client , not your company.as your client , i expect you to be square with me at all times . can you do that ? __eou__ i don't see a problem . __eou__ good ! do you have any questions ?
both of the two young ladies are the candidates for the position __eou__ the question is we only need one . __eou__ right.the choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ? __eou__ i should take the taller one for the choice .

mr . drake , i'm pleased to do business with your company . __eou__ we're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , mrs . wayne . __eou__ your company is very well respected . about how long have you been in business ? __eou__ almost twenty years . we were the first total pr services company of our kind in california . __eou__ and this is your company's head office ? __eou__ well , yes , but now we have six offices in california alone . __eou__ that's wonderful . isn't your company part of are corporation ? __eou__ that's right . we are their sole pr sector business . __eou__ that's not bad . how long have you been in pr ? __eou__ not long actually . so i'm sure i will learn a lot from our cooperation .

i've just got bean's new brand image . let's make a t-shirt line with these pics . __eou__ are you nuts ? it's the president of the united states in lingerie ! __eou__ exactly ! with the war in iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . __eou__ what's next ? tony blair in high heels ? __eou__ sure . i'd rather show bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . __eou__ inspiration can come in the strangest ways ...
could you tell me a little about the organization ? for example , how big is your workforce here ? __eou__ well in total we have around 150 employees based in hong kong with another 400 in our head office in beijing . the news desk staff in hong kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__ i see . and how about the working hours ? __eou__ well , as you know rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . you could be on call at any time . we do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__ well i am used to that , mr . parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__ good , as long as you understand that . __eou__ and when do you need to fill the vacancy , mr . parsons ? __eou__ yesterday ! but no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__ that sounds ideal .
well rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? __eou__ i don ’ t think so , mr . parsons . i think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__ okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . if any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . of course you can also call miss childs too . __eou__ great . rmm , when can i expect to hear from you ? __eou__ well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . miss childs will call you to discuss more on monday or tuesday . how does that sound ? __eou__ that sounds perfect . thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me mr . parsons . __eou__ the pleasure ’ s all mine , rebecca . __eou__ i hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__ absolutely . thanks for coming rebecca . goodbye .

i would like to ask for one day off next week . do you think the manager will agree ? i know it is the busy time for our company , but i do have some important things to handle . __eou__ well , it is hard to say . at least you need to come up with a good reason . __eou__ actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . my parents divorced many years ago . now she is ready to establish a new family . it is a special occasion . i ’ ve got to be there , right ? __eou__ yes , you should be there . go find the manager and ask . i think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . it will be signed by the manager for approval . __eou__ thank you so much .
can i ask for leave this afternoon ? __eou__ what is the problem ? __eou__ i had a headache this morning . i didn ’ t pay attention to it . i thought probably it is because i didn ’ t sleep well . but now it is getting worse and worse . i feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . maybe it is the migrated . __eou__ it is ok . you look really pale and red eyes . i suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . __eou__ thank you very much . i am sure good rest will do indeed . i don ’ t have this too often .
listen , you can not afford another day off . you ’ ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . __eou__ i know , but i am really sick . __eou__ well . i want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . __eou__ i understand , sir . i ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . i am sorry , mr . thomas
my computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__ if you want to speed up your system , you ’ ve got to clean it up first . __eou__ how ? __eou__ you need to free your disk space . the simplest way is to use a disk-cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . things should be fine next time you start . you also need to control what starts up . there is a program calls start-up delayer , it can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after windows boosts . for example , you can choose to set your fox mail program to load 30 seconds after windows starts up . __eou__ very useful advice , i will try them right now .
francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . in view of your achievement , i trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . __eou__ i am so happy to know that i could make some contribution to our company . __eou__ this title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . congratulations , and hope the best for you . __eou__ thank you , i will be doing my best .
hi , monica , how is everything going ? __eou__ everything goes well , but i am thinking about quitting my current job . __eou__ why ? you ’ re not satisfied anymore ? __eou__ i just sense . but i cannot grow anymore . my boss is not really supporting me . i am interested in some positions in other jv companies , but i need to do some more in-step research before i send my application letters out . __eou__ that is important . doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . __eou__ certainly , it is very nice talking with you . but i really have to go now . catch you later . __eou__ ok , good luck to you .
congratulations , francis . your hard working finally pays off . i am so happy for your promotion . __eou__ thanks , monica . without support from you and other colleagues , i would not have made it . __eou__ i hope i could get promoted some day . tell me about your experience , ok ? __eou__ well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . they might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . you learn more from that actually . sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . __eou__ how do you think if i volunteer for some work ? __eou__ i think it is a smart idea . our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
marketing manager ’ s office . can i help you ? __eou__ mr . smith , please . __eou__ sorry , he is out . __eou__ what time do you expect him back then ? __eou__ sorry , i am not sure . can i take a message ? __eou__ no , thanks . i will call back later . __eou__ that ’ s fine . please call again later . __eou__ ok . thank you . goodbye .
when can i have your firm c . i . f . prices , that is to say , the final offer , mr . london ? __eou__ we ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . would you be free to come by then ? __eou__ yes . i ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . __eou__ perfect . our offer remains open for 3 days . __eou__ i don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . if your prices are agreeable and if i can get the commission i want , i can place the order right away . __eou__ i ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . our prices haven ’ t changed much . __eou__ i ’ m glad to hear that . as i ’ ve just said , i hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__ we shall be very pleased . is there anything else i can do for you , mrs . anderson ? __eou__ i ’ m buying for chain department stores in canada . they are also interested in egyptian carpets . could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ? __eou__ certainly , i ’ ll make an appointment for you with mr . jordan of the egypt national native produce and animal by-products import and export corporation . __eou__ thank you very much .
if you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory . __eou__ it ’ s very kind of you to say so . my associate and i will be interested in visiting your factory . __eou__ let us know when you are free . we ’ ll arrange the tour for you . __eou__ thank you . i ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . there ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes . __eou__ that ’ s for sure . you ’ ll know our products better after the visit .
we did a survey on your job performance . __eou__ how did i do ? __eou__ not so good . lots of complains . __eou__ really ? i thought i was doing well . __eou__ your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . i hope i ’ ve made my point .
i ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along . __eou__ that ’ ll be most helpful . __eou__ that is our office block . we have all the administrative depart - ments there . down there is the research and development section . __eou__ how much do you spend on development every year ? __eou__ about 3-4 % of the gross sales . __eou__ what ’ s that building opposite us ? __eou__ that ’ s the warehouse . we keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . __eou__ if i placed an order now , how long would it be before i got delivery ? __eou__ it would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want .
how do you think the report i wrote ? __eou__ not bad . but there is more room for improvement . __eou__ i jumped the gun . __eou__ there were some gaps in your report . please be more sorrow . __eou__ yes , i overlooked some facts . i ’ ll be more sorrow .
i ’ m glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . i hope to conclude some substantial business with you . __eou__ it ’ s a great pleasure to meet you , mr . brown . i believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . may i know what particular items you ’ re interested in ? __eou__ i ’ m interested in your hardware . i ’ ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . i think some of the items will find a ready market in canada . here is a list of my requirements , for which i ’ d like to have your lowest quotations , c . i . f . vancouver . __eou__ thank you for your inquiry . would you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offers ? __eou__ i ’ ll do that . meanwhile , could you give me an indication of price ? __eou__ here are our f . o . b . price lists . all the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . __eou__ what about the commission ? from european suppliers i usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . it ’ s the general practice . __eou__ as a rule we don ’ t allow any commission . but if the order is a substantial one , we ’ ll consider it . __eou__ you see , but i do business on a commission basis . a commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . even two or three percent would help . __eou__ that ’ s something we can discuss later .
how do i submit an expense report ? __eou__ you need all your receipts for reimbursement . __eou__ you mean i have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? __eou__ yes , here is the form for an expense report . fill it out and give it to me . i ’ ll get it signed for you .
good morning , miss monica . nice to meet you again ! __eou__ good morning , mr . thomas , it is nice to see you too . __eou__ after the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . so , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . what is your expected salary ? __eou__ i ’ ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . depend on my work qualifications and experience , i would like to have 5000 yuan to start . __eou__ the basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . __eou__ it is a bit lower than i expected . but i can accept that . what are the working hours ? __eou__ 40 hours a week , monday to friday , 9 am to 5 pm with one hour lunch break every day .. __eou__ do i have to work on weekend ? if so , how do you pay for the overtime ? __eou__ we do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like spring festival and the mid-autumn day . __eou__ is there probation ? __eou__ no probation is involved . if you feel good , you can start next week .
hello , mr . thomas . could you spare a minute ? __eou__ what do you need ? __eou__ i need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ ve hired . i think i am going to have some problems working with him . __eou__ he seems to be quite qualified . if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
could you give me an expense report ? i would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . __eou__ here you are . do you need glue ? __eou__ that is very kind of you . i ’ m just running out of glue . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
with tomorrow being labor day and all , i think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . what do you say ? __eou__ what ! that sounds perfectly ridiculous ! labour day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__ well , we all get labour day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . it's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . i think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . __eou__ so if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? __eou__ in our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . we'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early .
i call this meeting to order . thank you all in attendance today , i know it's a busy day for you all . we have a lot of material to cover today . did everyone get an agenda ? __eou__ i need a copy of the agenda . also , may i suggest something ? i know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . __eou__ we should be able to finish everything up before then . let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . the first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . __eou__ i propose we accept the minutes . __eou__ good . do i have a second ? __eou__ i second . __eou__ motion carried . now , next on our agenda is our budget review . margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? __eou__ i gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . we've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . __eou__ what kind of action is required ? __eou__ if everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . next week , we can cast the final approval .
could i ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? __eou__ go ahead , please . __eou__ how long is my paid vacation every year ? __eou__ you ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year . __eou__ what about the insurance and housing policies ? __eou__ we will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . __eou__ how often is the bonus ? __eou__ you ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . __eou__ do i have training opportunities ? __eou__ we provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . __eou__ well , i don ’ t have any other questions so far . i would like to think a couple of days before i give you my final answer . __eou__ sure . i will ask lucy to call you in two days . __eou__ ok , thank you for your time and patience . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
give these sales figures a look . it's pretty depressing . we're way in the red this year . we can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . __eou__ you're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . but i think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . __eou__ deman is dropping . the problem is our competition . they are monopolizing the market ! __eou__ maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . __eou__ it's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . if we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . __eou__ do you think it's that serious ? __eou__ look at this numbers and see for yourself . read'sm and weep . __eou__ my goodness , i didn't realize it was that bad .
what's our target audience for this campaign ? __eou__ this go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . __eou__ do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? __eou__ well , there are some similarities that come up . because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . but that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . __eou__ right , that makes sense . what's the average age ? __eou__ demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 k a year .
what kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? __eou__ marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . all together , there will be 15 events . __eou__ what kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? i don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... __eou__ it's not what you're thinking . these events will give us a wider exposure than most . take the tri-city marathon for starters . this is a highly publicized event . the television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . __eou__ other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? __eou__ we've got a spot in olympic stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . __eou__ sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? __eou__ it might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . these are the events that our customers and potential customers care about .
how long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__ let's see ... you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles . __eou__ fine . we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__ no , the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ? __eou__ we're working on different steps in different areas.for example , our colbert line is thriving in american markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.in asia , however , it's a different story.most people haven't even heard of colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . __eou__ what are you doing to increase understanding in the european sector ? __eou__ understanding comes from product differentiation.we get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like .
the product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . __eou__ unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . __eou__ why is the price so high ? __eou__ it's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . __eou__ model of computers aren't compatible ? __eou__ most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . __eou__ maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . __eou__ but by then , the technology will be outdated . __eou__ true , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . __eou__ that's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . __eou__ this model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . __eou__ i guess you get what you pay for .
didn ’ t you punch in this morning , monica ? __eou__ sorry , i don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__ that ’ s ok . i should have told you earlier . this is a company rule . __eou__ do we also need to punch out after work ? __eou__ according to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . __eou__ how about the lunch break , lucy ? __eou__ from eleven thirty to 1 o ’ clock . __eou__ may i ask whether we need to work overtime ? __eou__ sometimes , but not quite often .
good morning , i am monica . are you mr . white , the manager of finance department ? i am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . __eou__ yes , that is me . nice to meet you , monica . welcome on board ! __eou__ thank you . i am very happy to have my own office now . i ’ ve never had one before . it is very nice . __eou__ well , we have nicer things than that in this company . you will find out soon . __eou__ really ? what could that be ? __eou__ well , i bet you will love them too . if you need help , just ask me any time . i am in the next door . you can also reach me through the extension 508 . __eou__ that is very kind of you . thank you very much .

okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . let's review them all together . __eou__ this first one , i have a question ... this graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? can this line be right ? it looks like our sales plummeted . i can't believe we did that poorly ... if i remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . __eou__ i think you are looking at the wrong line . the rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . you are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . the one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . i think there was a problem in the marketing plan . some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . __eou__ well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . __eou__ that is our one major success . if you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . __eou__ at lease they stayed the same . that's better than dropping .
hi , i am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . a technician has just come and checked it . he will bring me a new one tomorrow . it seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . can i use the one in your office ? __eou__ of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__ yes , i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? __eou__ yes , it will print immediately .
i can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . i thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . __eou__ it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . __eou__ ok , no problem . we do it ourselves . __eou__ do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible . __eou__ check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ? __eou__ yes , very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed , so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ? __eou__ either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
would you please mail these letters , lucy ? __eou__ yes , sir . __eou__ these two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . others are ordinary letters . __eou__ all right , who should i send them to ? __eou__ it ’ s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london . __eou__ ok , home or office address ? __eou__ office address , please . he might be at work when they arrive . __eou__ should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? __eou__ yes , it ’ s right .
look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . i ’ ve pushed the start button . it is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . what ’ s going on ? __eou__ let me check . it has a paper jam . __eou__ i didn ’ t pay attention to that . i will try to get the paper out . __eou__ be careful , the cartridge can be very hot .
please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__ well , all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__ what are they ? __eou__ they are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__ and what is the most important point ? __eou__ you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule .
hello , this is francis . __eou__ hi , this is monica . i was wondering when we can work on this financial report . __eou__ today , i am busy all day long . __eou__ shall i see you on friday morning ? __eou__ that ’ s not good for me at all.it ’ ll have to be another time . __eou__ we must find some time to read report . __eou__ i know . i am available from 1 pm to 4 pm on friday afternoon . __eou__ that ’ s all right . then see you on friday afternoon . __eou__ see you .
lucy , i ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__ monica , wait a moment . i think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . __eou__ i think i can handle it by myself . __eou__ i ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__ i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__ other company rules also need your attention . __eou__ like this one ? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__ don ’ t mention it .
we have the orientation this afternoon . __eou__ what ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? __eou__ the company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company id , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . __eou__ quite a lot . all them one afternoon ? __eou__ yes , it is not easy . __eou__ it is ok with me . i enjoy being busy and learning new things .
hello , this is lucy from abc company . is this monica ? __eou__ yes , it is . __eou__ i am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 pm this thursday afternoon . please come on time . __eou__ ok , thank you . by the way , could you please tell me how i can get there from a community ? __eou__ oh , you can take the subway , get off at b stop and walk north for several minutes . you will find a building . it will take about 40 minutes in total . __eou__ i got it . thank you so much . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .

what ’ s up ? __eou__ i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , i can ’ t send out this e-mail . do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__ do you mind i have a look at your computer ? __eou__ of course not , i appreciate that . __eou__ well , it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__ i see . what can i do now ? __eou__ you can send a compressed one .
the demographic reports are in ... from the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . __eou__ why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__ according to the report , our boston crowd is quite different make-up from our chicago folks . our boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... you know the kind . chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... i think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__ i have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... to make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__ no kidding . we've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups .
excuse me , could you please show me the way to the human resource department ? __eou__ yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ? __eou__ yes , of course . i am monica . i have made an appointment with your hr manager . __eou__ just a minute please . i ’ ll make a call to the hr office . yes , they confirm your appointment . please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . you can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
how come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__ you mean the network connection ? __eou__ yes , i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click . __eou__ i have the same question . i can ’ t send out mails . we ’ d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ ok .
what's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? we were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.why haven't i heard anything about it ? did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? __eou__ no , sir . the plant expansion project has been delayed.there was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.it seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . __eou__ you're joking , right ? no wonder we've been tied up with this project . i know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? __eou__ the environmental review board has a team on it now.hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week .
how long will it take for our order to be delivered ? __eou__ let's see . you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china . they should be able to place your order before the end of next week . it will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of ningpo . the freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today . domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles . __eou__ fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . __eou__ no , the chinese company has that all worked out . with the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . __eou__ if we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . __eou__ we need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but i'm not sure how to do it . __eou__ we've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . __eou__ yeah , you're right . we've got to get the most popular phrases there ... how else can we boost site traffic ? __eou__ i think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . if they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . __eou__ i guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . i would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products .
have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? who do you think is our digest threat ? __eou__ from the numbers , it seems like forest inc . is our digest competitor ... le'ban and markford are also major contenders in our market . __eou__ le'ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... with them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . __eou__ here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... __eou__ thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . with competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . we need a price we can compete with . __eou__ we're in a very competitive environment . it's sink or saimin this market . __eou__ better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . i want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .
how much do you have budgeted for our trip to las angeles ? __eou__ in total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__ yes , i want to know exactly where the money is going . give me a detailed report . __eou__ first we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . for our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . that's another $ 800 . __eou__ weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? we're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__ i have two people to a room . the $ 80 room rate is the lowest i could find . with the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . __eou__ so far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? __eou__ i have budget $ 25 per peron per day for food expenses . that totals another $ 800 . and for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , i have estimated about $ 400 . __eou__ well , that's only $ 4000 . didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? where is the rest of the money ? __eou__ that's my buffer ... i wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry .
how did your company's fundraiser go ? __eou__ the fundraiser events went really well . we were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the american cancer society . all of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . __eou__ so how does it work ? how were you able to make money with the marathon ? __eou__ each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . all in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . __eou__ sounds like a great deal for the american cancer society . __eou__ in all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . the exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . we accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .
john , i'd like to see you in my office for a minute . __eou__ yes , sir , i'll be there in just a moment . __eou__ john , i have been watching you . i've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and i'm impressed . you've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . i just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , i'm recommending you for promotion . __eou__ gosh sir , thank you , sir ! i had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . __eou__ well , it's not going to be in our department . i've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . there's supervisory spot opening up in financial . i'm turning your name in for it . __eou__ management ? wow , i had no idea i could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . __eou__ you've earned it .
what's the deal with the asia area sales ? did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ? __eou__ we got numbers back from our offices in beijing , hong kong , taipei , singapore and tokyo , we're waiting on bangkok and kula lumpur . __eou__ what do the preliminary figures tell you ? any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the far east ? __eou__ it's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . __eou__ for example ? __eou__ for instance , some products that do very well in tokyo branch are a flop in malaysia.we ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans .
hello , this is lucy from abc company . __eou__ hello , lucy . __eou__ i ’ m calling to see if you have made your decision . you are the right person we are seeking for . __eou__ yes , i have decided to work with your company . __eou__ good news for us . when can you start to work ? __eou__ it ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . i ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . __eou__ ok , please come to my office at 9 am next monday . i will introduce you to our boss . __eou__ no problem . thank you for calling me . __eou__ you ’ re welcome .
thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare . __eou__ employee welfare ? what all does that include ? __eou__ in the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . but we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . __eou__ what kind of considerations are we talking about ? __eou__ it is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . they will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on friday nights . we have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . let ’ s all welcome ms . michelle cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . __eou__ our company now has n ombudsman ? __eou__ yes , that ’ s right . from now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , ms . cain will be your advocate . if you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . her job is to have your best interest at heart .
are you free next thursday ? __eou__ yeah , why , is there something going on thursday ? __eou__ a bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . __eou__ bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , i had no idea bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? __eou__ retirement age is still 65 , but i think more and more people are retiring earlier , i think bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . __eou__ wow ... i thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? __eou__ well , i think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ?
mr hughes ? do you have a minute ? i would like to discuss something with you . __eou__ what can i do for you ? __eou__ i was wondering , i have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . also , i ’ ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent japanese . is that right ? __eou__ yes , that ’ s right . i do speak decent japanese . __eou__ right now i ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our asian market . we have several upcoming events to take place for the japanese cities . we ’ ll be heading to tokyo next month to get things started . what i would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . __eou__ exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? __eou__ we aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . we would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . __eou__ so if i can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? __eou__ we could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in japan.at the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you .
how often are stockholders meetings held ? __eou__ stockholders meetings are held biannually . usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . in between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . financial statements are made once a year . __eou__ what percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? i'm guessing not a large percentage ... __eou__ you're right , it's a low percentage . also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . it's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . __eou__ so , how much say do the stockholders really have ? __eou__ unless they're united , very little ...
please send this memo out to all the managerial staff ... there will be training for all the department heads next week . attendance for managerial staff is mandatory , except for the financial department . financial officers may participate if their schedules allow . __eou__ you would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? i'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? who all is included in managerial staff ? __eou__ managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . it includes all supervisors and department heads . __eou__ what about the senior account managers ? do they count ? __eou__ no , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . they are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training .
so tell me , what's the difference between the board of directors , the ceo , and the stockholders ? they all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__ no , there's a definite difference . you know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . then there's the ceo — the chief executive officer . he's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . it's too dangerous . that's the reason for a board of directors . the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . they could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__ how many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__ usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . they meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . they provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .
where is the boss ? i need him to sign a few documents . i checked in his office , but he is not there . is he out of the office now ? __eou__ yes . today is tuesday , so the boss went off to his mba seminar class . he is out of the office every tuesday and thursday mornings , and he has classes all day saturday and sunday . __eou__ what's he studying ? __eou__ he is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . he can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his mba . __eou__ sounds like a tiring schedule.he ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? __eou__ the classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . but as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ he just has his secretary do his homework for him .
could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before i send it out to the human resources department ? __eou__ sure , let me take a look ... personal information , education , experience , training ... i think you should add another section for language . you speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . __eou__ but languages don't have anything to do with engineering . shouldn't everything i put on my resume have something to do with my field ? __eou__ not necessarily . i think people would be impressed by your language abilities . it says something about your level of intellect and experience . also , i think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . __eou__ it's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if i am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? __eou__ well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . that's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
francis , what ’ s that ? __eou__ well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . __eou__ could you tell me something about it ? __eou__ ok . on the top , mr . thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . __eou__ how many departments do we have ? __eou__ four . they are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and hr department . i directly report to mr . white . he is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . probably you will be meeting him at lunch . __eou__ ok . who should i report to ? __eou__ mr . white , too .
so , where can i start my work ? __eou__ well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . you ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . __eou__ and i represent ? __eou__ our company just concluded a business transaction . you can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction . __eou__ ok , thank you . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . feel free to ask me any time you need help .
hello mr . jones , please have a seat . thank you for coming in today . i have read your resume . you completed university in england ? __eou__ yes , i went to cambridge . after graduation , i started right away into the advertising industry . later , i made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . __eou__ so , what experience do you have ? __eou__ i have ten years marketing experience . this includes both entry level and management positions . in my last position , i worked my way up to being director of the marking department . __eou__ i can see that from your resume.your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? __eou__ i felt after five years in one place , i was ready for something new . i would like to have a job that is challenging , something that i can see and do new things every day . i loved many things about my former job , and i left with amiable feelings on both sides . i was just ready for something new . __eou__ i see . do you want to work full-time or part-time ? __eou__ i would rather work full-time . __eou__ i'll make note of that . now , what are your salary expectations ? __eou__ i am willing to negotiate , but i expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
how long does it take to get to downtown from here ? __eou__ it is 15 minutes ’ drive . __eou__ what companies do we have in our neighborhood ? __eou__ mitsubishi , hp , ibm and many other famous corporations . __eou__ does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? __eou__ yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building . __eou__ it ’ s such a large firm . do we have our own staff restaurant ? __eou__ yes , at the end of the hall .
bob , can i talk to you for a minute ? there have been some developments for the stewart case that i really need to talk to you about . __eou__ yeah , what's the matter now ? we've had so much trouble with this case already . don't tell me there's more bad news . __eou__ well , i'm afraid there is . i have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . __eou__ what ? what does that mean ? why won't there be any results ? __eou__ i hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . there's nothing left . i'm so sorry ... __eou__ oh , no , you can't be serious . i never expect anything like this would happened . what are we going to do ? __eou__ there's nothing that can be done . everything is gone . i wish i could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . we will just have to figure out a way to move on .
we are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next tuesday . do you think you can handle that ? __eou__ we are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? we need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . the earliest i will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . __eou__ no , i must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? __eou__ we can do that , but it will cost ... if we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , i'd say , maybe 10 % . __eou__ are you kidding ? __eou__ no , and let me tell you why ... if i make my guys stay over to check the inventory , i'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . i estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , i can have them do it . otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and i'll call you with the numbers after they're done . it's your call ...
hello ? ms . patterson ? this is bill from workmate calling . i'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate i sent for your gala dinner project next month ... as i said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . __eou__ oh , yes . i reviewed your estimate . but it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? __eou__ yes , i have several copies , but they're all different versions ... the latest i have is version 12 , is that current ? __eou__ no . later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . __eou__ hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . i see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . that will definitely add to your cost on this project ...
how can i help you ? __eou__ yes , i am james mason from anderson and associates . i would like to see mr . smith . __eou__ do you have an appointment ? __eou__ yes , he knows i'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . __eou__ i wonder if mr . smith forgot your meeting . i am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . will you please have a seat ? __eou__ sure . __eou__ yes , mr . mason , i just checked with our office manager , ms . terry , she said mr . smith briefed her on your project . she is just finishing up a meeting now . she could be with your shortly . would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? __eou__ that would be very nice . thank you . __eou__ right this way , mr . mason . we can start with our front office . when ms . terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . there is a conference room already prepared
it is really exciting news . __eou__ what news ? __eou__ you don ’ t know ? the company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . __eou__ you know what we will get ? __eou__ we will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . and if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . __eou__ what docking station ? __eou__ this is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . the socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . __eou__ another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , i don ’ t need a desktop anymore . a laptop is enough .
how come it is slow as a snail today ? __eou__ you mean the network connection ? __eou__ yes , i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . it took me almost one minute to open it . then there is no response to any click . __eou__ i have the same question . i can ’ t send out mails . we ’ d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately . __eou__ ok .
look at this survey conducted by a website . a quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . hi , francis , what about you ? __eou__ well , i just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . anyway , i have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . __eou__ though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , i don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . __eou__ certainly , work always comes first . __eou__ but it is lucky for us . the company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . i have shopped too often online these days . __eou__ well , keep a low profile .
what ’ s up ? __eou__ i guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , i can ’ t send out this e-mail . do you have the number of the text port ? __eou__ yes , do you mind if i have a look at your computer ? __eou__ of course not , i appreciate that . __eou__ well , it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the e-mail capacity . __eou__ i see . what can i do now ? __eou__ you can send a compressed one .
did you hear something ? __eou__ oh , it is my cell phone ringing . i set it in the vibration mode . __eou__ it is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . it is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . __eou__ you are right . some ring tone is just terribly loud . you can hear it even in the next door . it is really a kind of distraction . __eou__ maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . __eou__ good idea .
have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? __eou__ yes , not bad . like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . __eou__ well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , i think it is not reasonable . what if there are some important calls ? __eou__ well , this one is not compulsory . it is just suggestion . __eou__ i didn ’ t pay attention to that .
i take care of the letters . i may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . __eou__ so you have to open all the envelopes . __eou__ yes , except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . __eou__ do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? __eou__ yes , and i check all the e-mails for mr . thomas .
what are in this folder ? __eou__ they are reports of our company . __eou__ are they filed alphabetically ? __eou__ no , they are filed according to dates . __eou__ can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? __eou__ no problem , here you are .
a friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . he told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . he recommended me to subscribe to it . what do you say ? __eou__ i think it is good if we know enough about career planning . we will make wiser choices . what else did he tell you about it ? __eou__ well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . __eou__ sounds practical ! to be honest , sometimes i feel puzzled about my future career . i am not sure if this job suits me the best though i work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . i have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . __eou__ making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . it seems that you need this course more than i do . i love my current job . if i take this course , i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . i need these to improve my current work performance . __eou__ ok , then we can sign up for it together .
you didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . what ’ s up ? __eou__ well , i just came in . i worked overtime yesterday . some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . so i stayed to double check them . the boss was aware of my very late work of last night . so before he left office , he told me i could come one hour later this morning . __eou__ but you still look a little bit tired . what time did you leave ? __eou__ it was around 1 thirty in the morning . i guess i didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . i just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . __eou__ that ’ s normal after a tense work evening . working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . once , i worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . that really broke my rhythm and i got a little sick later . __eou__ working at weekend is something i hate to do most . __eou__ but if the company asks , what else can we do ?
where were decorating and i ’ m going to ask some things . __eou__ well , i ’ ll be glad to help you out . we can deliver what you need to your office . __eou__ shall we need at 1 fifteen this thursday ? we definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . __eou__ fine , i ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on thursday .
good morning . i ’ m liu yi , from china xyz company . we have an appointment with mr . thomas . __eou__ welcome to abc company . we have been expecting you , please have a seat . i will call him . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ mr . thomas will be here very soon . in the meantime , may i ask all of you to sign in so that i can issue your passes ? __eou__ should each of us write separately ? __eou__ yes , please . please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see .
i am liu yi , from china xyz company . i ’ d like to see mr . thomas , please . __eou__ do you have an appointment , mr . liu ? __eou__ no , i am afraid not . i just arrive in town today . __eou__ mr . thomas is quite busy , i ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . __eou__ would you please ask when he will be free ? __eou__ have a seat please while i call .
how long have you been in this company ? __eou__ i came two years ago after i graduated from college . this is my first job . __eou__ you must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . __eou__ of course ! everyday , there is a deadline to meet . bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . it is so busy . but anyway , i have been trying my best to be a good employee . __eou__ well , you ’ ve adapted yourself very well . everyone in our office thinks you ’ ve made a great progress in the past two years . what is your secret ? __eou__ it is so encouraging to hear this remark . the secret is to make plans . write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . then just work hard .
do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? __eou__ how regular ? __eou__ an average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . __eou__ you are kidding me ? it is against the labor law . they should be aware of their rights . __eou__ but these people say nothing about that . they are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__ that ’ s not right , somebody should do something .
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? __eou__ of course ! it is the no . 1 stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it . __eou__ totally agree . what is your solution ? __eou__ well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy . __eou__ you seem to have a very relaxed outlook . __eou__ it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress . __eou__ but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses . __eou__ i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
i am going on a business trip to guangzhou next monday morning . __eou__ to visit our supplier ? __eou__ yes , as the new year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . __eou__ well , i guess you will meet many people in this field . so don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . __eou__ sure . __eou__ by the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? __eou__ no , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . __eou__ ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . you have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . and then attach them to your expense account . when you get back , our company will reimburse everything . __eou__ i see . what about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? __eou__ i am not sure . you can check with the finance department . __eou__ i will call them this afternoon , thanks . __eou__ you ’ re welcome . have a nice trip .
good morning , i am monica . are you mr . white , the manager of finance department ? i am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . __eou__ yes , that is me . nice to meet you , monica . welcome on board ! __eou__ thank you . i am very happy to have my own office now . i ’ ve never had one before . it is very nice . __eou__ well , we have nicer things than that in this company . you will find out soon . __eou__ really ? what could that be ? __eou__ well , i bet you will love them too . if you need help , just ask me any time . i am in the next door . you can also reach me through the extension 508 . __eou__ that is very kind of you . thank you very much .
hi , francis , how was your business trip ? __eou__ it was a nightmare . __eou__ what ’ s up ? __eou__ actually , the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then i lost my carry on bag when i was tackling with the officers in charge . i left the airport three hours later than i expected and then i was caught in a traffic jam . when i finally got home , i was totally exhausted . but i found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . __eou__ this is really a sad story . did they trace back your luggage ? __eou__ i am still waiting for their call . __eou__ take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
did you see the letter i got from bradford films ? they sent it in response to your phone call last week . __eou__ if they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? __eou__ i guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the milton contract . __eou__ can i see it for a second ? __eou__ sure , here it is ... __eou__ dear mr . clark , further to our telephone call last friday , i am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . as we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . __eou__ did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? __eou__ let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” it looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? __eou__ i don't think so , why do you ask ? __eou__ the letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” i don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... __eou__ maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . you should give them another call .
lucy , i ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__ monica , wait a moment . i think we ’ d better call the repairman to do it . __eou__ i think i can handle it by myself . __eou__ i ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__ i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__ other company rules also need your attention . __eou__ like this one ? __eou__ never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . __eou__ yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__ don ’ t mention it .
can you help me for a minute ? __eou__ sure , what i can do for you ? __eou__ i'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , but i just don't know exactly what to say , i don't even know how to get started , i know i should write dear mr . mrs . or ms . , but the problem is i don't know the name of contact person . __eou__ you can just put dear sir or madam , officialese not personal , you can write to whom may concerned . __eou__ ok , so i first thanks them for their business , i can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support , how is that ? __eou__ good ! but also , write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing , give them more reference . __eou__ like regarding our new product line , we would like to announce a special price discount __eou__ right , do you need them to respond ? __eou__ yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . how should i write that ? __eou__ you can tell them " please finding the enclosed customer service survey , else also , you can say attach a customer survey . if you need resource it right away , you can tell them the urgent by saying please return the survey without dely as soon as possible . maye it more polite with this as early as convenience .
so , monica , how do you like your new office ? __eou__ well , i love it . the room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially , i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place ! __eou__ that ’ s very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . __eou__ what was so bad about it ? __eou__ small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . __eou__ sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn ’ t take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . __eou__ totally agree . by the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
didn ’ t you punch in this morning , monica ? __eou__ sorry , i don ’ t know the rule about punching . __eou__ that ’ s ok . i should have told you earlier . this is a company rule . __eou__ do we also need to punch out after work ? __eou__ according to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . __eou__ how about the lunch break , lucy ? __eou__ from 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock . __eou__ may i ask whether we need to work overtime ? __eou__ sometimes , but not quite often .
may i ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? __eou__ sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . __eou__ thank you for telling me that . __eou__ but remind you , there are some forbidden activities . __eou__ what are they ? i ’ ll be careful . __eou__ don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . __eou__ i got it . __eou__ never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . __eou__ i see .
we'd like to welcome everyone to the michelson tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . my name is paul shafer , i'll be showing you around today . please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , i'll be happy to answer questions for you . __eou__ is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? __eou__ that's an excellent question . i'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . the reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . as you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . __eou__ how long will the tour take ? __eou__ it should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . all together our tour should last about half an hour . __eou__ okay ... __eou__ well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? if you'll follow me , first i'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ...
our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__ we will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? that will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . the office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__ you can double check with the housekeeping department , but i am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . they are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . as long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__ ok , i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . is there anything else we need to order while i am at it ? __eou__ i think the only thing is toner . try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . __eou__ ok , will do .
did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? i'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , i'm pretty sure they came in last night . __eou__ everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . but i noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . maybe you can take a look at them . if the copy is unreadable , i'll call them and ask them to relax . __eou__ yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . these copies are so dark , i can't make out any of the words . __eou__ what about that one ? __eou__ this one ? this one is so light i can barely read it . how can that be ? __eou__ you know , i think the fax machine is out of toner , i can change the toner cartridge . that should solve the problem . __eou__ yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . and look , there's about three pages missing ! it looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! __eou__ i guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . don't worry , i'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , i'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine .
may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i would like to place an order for toner cartridges . we have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time . __eou__ let me key in your information into my computer . i will pull up our records for you . do you have an order number ? what name is the order listed under ? __eou__ it should be under leslie smith . the number is 184796 a . __eou__ yes , mr . smith . i have an order for three cases of cartridges , it that what you would like to refill ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ is there the correct billing address ? __eou__ no , pls post the bill to 124 hildrod lane , milton county , 98830 . __eou__ i will send you an invoice in the next few days . your order should be delivered before the end of the day on monday . __eou__ thank you .

hi , i am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . a technician has just come and checked it . he will bring me a new one tomorrow . it seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . can i use the one in your office ? __eou__ of course you can . i am sure this one works very well . i just sent dozens of pages . how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ? __eou__ yes , i think you have the same model as i have . does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? __eou__ yes , it will print immediately .
please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . __eou__ well , all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . __eou__ what are they ? __eou__ they are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . __eou__ and what is the most important point ? __eou__ you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . __eou__ what ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ? __eou__ yes , very urgent . and there is no other fax machine around . and the office of our boss is closed , so i can not use his machine either . and his secretary is out . do you have any suggestion ? __eou__ either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
i can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . i thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . __eou__ it seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . ok , no problem . we do it ourselves . __eou__ do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible . __eou__ check with somebody from the it department . they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .

let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . __eou__ i have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . my experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where i have been able to apply my paralegal education . i was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . i really love research and analyzing facts . my major in college was english , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . i am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . __eou__ what do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? __eou__ flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . in my last position , i supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . there were days when i had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . i would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so i didn't drop the ball . at the same time , i made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . i think communication is probably the next key quality . it really worked well when i talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . __eou__ can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? __eou__ there was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . even though i worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and i stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . it was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . my boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . __eou__ tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . __eou__ i remember a case that was filled with obstacles . the first thing i did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . i assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . i was able to get some input from another lawyer i happened to see at lunch . through some hard work and fact digging , i was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . i took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and i discussed and eventually resolved.my boss was impressed with the work i had done . __eou__ what are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ my strengths are my caring about getting the job done . i am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . as far as weaknesses , i really enjoy my work , and sometimes i put in too much time . but i am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . __eou__ tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . __eou__ i did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . i asked her if i could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . it turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . i took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . __eou__ when do you find a job satisfying ? __eou__ my biggest satisfaction is when i experience growth in a job . when i first started as a paralegal , i had a lot to learn . but through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , i have come a long way . i've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . __eou__ how would your coworkers describe you ? __eou__ first , they'll say i have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . i really enjoy working with people . secondly , they'll say i had great customer service skills . i put the customer first . and thirdly , they'll say that i know the law . i put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . __eou__ do you have any questions ? __eou__ yes , i do . on a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ?
how would you describe your ideal job ? __eou__ i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement . __eou__ why do you think you might like to work for our company ? __eou__ i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested.what ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field . __eou__ what makes you think you would be a success in this position ? __eou__ my graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . i am sure i will be successful . __eou__ how do you know about this company ? __eou__ your company is very reputed in this city . i heard much praise to your company .
what kind of person do you think you are ? __eou__ well , i am always energetic and enthusiastic . that's my strongest personality . __eou__ what are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ em , as i have said , i'm diligent and industrious . on the other hand , sometimes i'm too hard-working and i put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . __eou__ what qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ? __eou__ to work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . that is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . __eou__ how do you spend your leisure time ? __eou__ i like playing games and having sports . they are my favourite hobbies . __eou__ so , what kind of sport do you like most ? __eou__ oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one . i mean , i like all kinds of sports , basketball , swimming , bike riding and so on . maybe it is just the reason why i am so energetic and vigorous .
tell me a little bit about yourself , please . __eou__ my name is dunlin and i live in beijing . i was born in 1980 . i will graduate from peking university this july . i have majored in accounting . __eou__ would you tell me something about your family ? __eou__ there are three in my family , my parents and myself . my father is a teacher and my mother is a worker .

woo hoo ! this just might be the start of the rest of my life ! __eou__ what happened ? __eou__ i ’ m in the market for a job ! i went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until i got the names of a few employers i would like to work for . i have the resume i wrote for english class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . i ’ ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so i can address the letters personally . and you know i can be charming in interviews . goodbye my penniless days ! hello salary and a career ! __eou__ ben , we ’ re fifteen . what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . you know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . __eou__ uh-huh . __eou__ but i ’ m just in it for the money , right ? how else am i going to be able to afford to keep taking angela to the movies ? besides , i love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ?
now , miss childs passed on your resume to me and i ’ ve had the chance to look it over and i must say i ’ m quite impressed . __eou__ thank you very much . i ’ ve tried to keep it short and clear.if there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . __eou__ well yes , i do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . __eou__ yes , of course . well as you can see from the resume i ’ m 27 and grew up in brooklyn , new york , although our family moved to london when i was quite young , at around 16 . __eou__ ah i see , so you were actually educated in europe ? __eou__ yes precisely . although i was born in the us , i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ’ ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business __eou__ very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . __eou__ absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i ’ m really looking to settle down . __eou__ i see . okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? __eou__ sure .

we have the capital ready.right now i am looking at three different companies to produce our products.and your company , mr . chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . __eou__ i appreciate your remarks . and we are always happy to do more business.but , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.it requires a lot of investment for us . __eou__ you have some doubts about our products , i understand . __eou__ i would like to offer you a good price.but i won't be able to do that if i think this is a one-shot deal.so i would like to have some confidence in your idea . __eou__ of course . let me tell you in some detail about our idea.you know the popular hello kitty products . __eou__ yes , of course . __eou__ well , the products in themselves are very simple.it is the logo that is successful.so , hello kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . __eou__ and i would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from japan.it is the japanese that have made it a fad . __eou__ that might be true.but we have a logo concept that is great . it is really great . i think it will catch on in taiwan at least . young people will love it.it is because of our logo that our products will sell.we just need someone to produce the products for us.we have the backup and people to do the marketing . __eou__ so what you are really trying to sell is a fad . __eou__ yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.little accessories for young people . but the reason these will sell is the logo.just like hello kitty . __eou__ i understand . but why won't you show me the logo ? __eou__ because it hasn't been copyrighted . we want to get some protection for it.but while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . __eou__ i see . the problem , however , is that i can't be confident in giving you a good priceless i am confident your product will last . __eou__ i understand . for now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.we aren't going to sign a contract yet . we are just investigating . i only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.and then , i only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . __eou__ alright . i understand . right now you just want estimates . __eou__ yes .

what type of people do you work with most effectively ? __eou__ i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.it ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because i move quickly and i am decisive . __eou__ what things impress you in your colleagues ? __eou__ i admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . i also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . __eou__ what are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? __eou__ the only thing i really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . i want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that i have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . i believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . __eou__ how do you organize and plan for major projects ? __eou__ i love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.then , i set a timetable that's realistic.what i usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because i've already visualized what could happen and how i'd react . __eou__ describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . __eou__ i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks.the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because i could't bring my office files with me.luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . __eou__ how do you manage your time in a typical day ? __eou__ i've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.the last thing i do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which i take care of at the end of the day or week . __eou__ describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . __eou__ i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .

david , i am going for an interview tomorrow . it's an american company . can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? __eou__ well . they may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . __eou__ but they can see my resume . it's all in there . __eou__ i know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . __eou__ ok . what else ? __eou__ they may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? __eou__ i see . what about the salary ? __eou__ hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . i think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . and if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . and basically , that's about it . __eou__ ok , thanks , david . you ’ ve helped me a lot . __eou__ anytime . let me know how it works out .
anything else ? __eou__ yes , one last thing . how much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? __eou__ our employees receive 15 days of paid vacation every year . if you don't use the full 15 days , they carry over to the following year . __eou__ how about sick days ? __eou__ you get 5 paid sick days . __eou__ any other benefits ? __eou__ yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . __eou__ great . thanks so much for your time . __eou__ we'll contact you soon , tom . thanks for coming in .

i've read your report , and i'm not sure i agree with you.you think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? __eou__ that's right . i know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . __eou__ we give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . it sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . __eou__ right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.but employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . __eou__ i see . so our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . __eou__ that's right . if sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . we wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . __eou__ let's give it a shot !

from reviewing your resume i can see that you have ample experience for this position.what i want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job . __eou__ well i ’ m impressed with what the company has done in the past and i think by hiring me the company ’ s future can only be brighter . i find that my personal goals and ideas about business operation __eou__ so you ’ ve acquainted yourself with the company . it ’ s refreshing to interview someone who ’ s sure of what they want . __eou__ yes , i believe that it ’ s crucial for me to know if a company is right for me , not just if i ’ m right for the company . i ’ ve only been impressed by what i ’ ve read and heard and i see myself having __eou__ commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here . __eou__ well i ’ m definitely a team player as well as being highly self-motivated . i believe this company can fulfill my long-term goals and offer me great upward mobility . therefore you will find in me

i ’ ve just looked over your resume and i must admit i am quite impressed . __eou__ thank you . i ’ ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . __eou__ you ’ ve got plenty of training and experience . i wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . where do you see yourself ten years from now ? __eou__ to be honest , i don ’ t plan in that much detail . my goals tend to be general ; i define success according to the job at hand . i see myself advancing as i succeed , but i don ’ t necessarily dwell on __eou__ interesting ! and how do you feel about decision-making ? are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? __eou__ that depends a bit on the problem at hand . there are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail __eou__ sounds good . everyone is taking about teams these days . can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? __eou__ i see myself as an encourager . of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . in my last job , each representative handled __eou__ so , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper .

i can ’ t attend the meeting in washington . i ’ ve proposed you as the most able substitute . __eou__ but i ’ ve never been on a business trip before ! __eou__ it ’ s easy enough . just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . the accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses . __eou__ so the company will pay for everything ? __eou__ yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . it ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . __eou__ that sounds good . but what do you want me to do there ? __eou__ i ’ ve already paved the way . you just have to give a presentation on what our products are . i will do the follow-up and close the sale .
comfort inn , may i help you ? __eou__ i ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . __eou__ you ’ re in luck ! we ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . would you like to make a reservation ? __eou__ not just yet . i have one or two questions . how much for a single ? __eou__ during the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . but we ’ ve got a single super saver special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . and we ’ ve also extended our checkout time 00 in __eou__ that ’ s a good deal . since this is a working trip , i wonder if you have meeting rooms where i can get together with some clients . __eou__ yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . we can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking __eou__ that sounds great . do you accept checks ? __eou__ i ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . but we do accept all major credit cards .

i ’ m ready to settle the bill . __eou__ i hope you enjoyed your stay . __eou__ definitely ! very relaxing . __eou__ good . right , that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ what ? i only stayed three nights . __eou__ that ’ s right , sir . three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ but your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . __eou__ yes , of course . the meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . __eou__ but why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . __eou__ i ’ m sorry sir . the 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . that means it ’ s 250 per person . the room itself is 500 dollars a night . __eou__ perhaps i could talk to your manager ? __eou__ of course . just a minute ; i ’ ll get her .
mr . lee , all ready to check out ? we ’ ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . how will you be paying ? __eou__ i ’ d like to use my master card , if i could . hey , wait a minute ! this is a bit more than i expected . why is it so high ? __eou__ the bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ ve charged you for the correct services . most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . __eou__ what ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? __eou__ that ’ s the mini-bar . each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . the items you consume are put on your bill . __eou__ i had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! __eou__ those are for pay-per-view movies . each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? __eou__ yes , that ’ s right . but i had no idea i would be charged for all this . thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this .
i want some envelopes please . __eou__ do you want the large size , or the small size ? __eou__ the large size please . do have you any writing-paper ? __eou__ yes , we do . i don't have any small pads . i only have large ones . do you want a pad ? __eou__ yes , please . and i want some glue . __eou__ a bottle of glue . __eou__ and i want a large box of chalk , too . __eou__ i only have small boxes . do you want one ? __eou__ no , thank you . __eou__ is that all ? __eou__ that's all , thank you . __eou__ what else do you want ? __eou__ i want my change .
accounting , this is mike . __eou__ mike , this is leo in sales . i was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.are we still on ? __eou__ goodness ! it ’ s been so long i actually forgot . let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar . __eou__ ok . see you at your office at 2:30 . __eou__ right , see you then !
hey there ! i ’ ve been hoping to run into you . are you busy tomorrow morning ? __eou__ let me see ... wednesday morning . yes , i am booked solid all morning . what ’ s up ? __eou__ i was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . i ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . it has a lot of complicated form __eou__ i can explain them to you . it ’ ll just take about a half an hour . how about friday afternoon ? __eou__ ooh . sorry , that ’ s not good for me . i am tied up all day friday . we ’ ll have to do it next week . i am wide open then . __eou__ ok . shall we say next week , on tuesday at 2:30 ? __eou__ sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . i ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros .
good afternoon , mr . dome ’ s office . __eou__ this is denise , mr . bruce ’ s secretary . i was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with mr . dome at 4 o ’ clock . __eou__ yes , it ’ s confirmed for here in our office . __eou__ is your address still 1150 lake road ? __eou__ yes , that ’ s correct . __eou__ ok . thank you .
hi ron , this is kim at headquarters . __eou__ oh , hi kim . how ’ s it going ? __eou__ great , thanks . i was calling to change our meeting next week . __eou__ ok , sure . when did you have in mind ? __eou__ well , i was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . __eou__ why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ? __eou__ that works for me ! i will call you when i get into town to reconfirm . __eou__ great . talk to you then .
hi . i ’ m here to catch flight 513 to new york . __eou__ may i see your ticket please ? __eou__ here you are . do you need to see my passport ? __eou__ any form of picture i . d . will do . __eou__ mmmm ... a photo i . d . i have my new jersey driver ’ s license . is that ok ? __eou__ that will do . what an interesting picture ! how old is it ? __eou__ actually it wad taken just last year , but i had a shaved head and a beard . can you still recognize me ? __eou__ barely . will you be checking any luggage today ? __eou__ yes , one suitcase . i also have a carry-on bag . __eou__ ok . mr . lee , you ’ re all set . your flight leaves from gate 10 . boarding begins at 10:30
hi i came in on flight 513 . everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there . __eou__ let me check the computer . uh-oh , looks like your luggage is on its way to paris . __eou__ you ’ re kidding . what am i going to do ? __eou__ well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . just leave us a contact number . __eou__ you can reach me at 13661306917 . __eou__ thank you . i am terribly sorry about this . it very rarely happens . we do have a sophisticated tracking system , so i know we will find it soon . but we apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ that ’ s ok . there wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . the shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . __eou__ wow ! i have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . __eou__ i ’ ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal .
i would like to buy a ticket to new york please . __eou__ when do you plan to travel ? __eou__ i ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . __eou__ are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? __eou__ yes i know , but i just got the chance to leave and so i am going to take it no matter what . __eou__ i understand . so that ’ s one ticket to new york , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . will that be one-way or round trip ? __eou__ i wish i could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . __eou__ when would you like to return ? __eou__ my return date will be the 14th . __eou__ ok . i have several seats available . would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__ anything but a center seat is fine with me . the middle seat drives me crazy ! __eou__ ok mr . lee . i have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in new york on the 6th at 6 __eou__ will there be any layovers ? __eou__ no , all flights are direct . __eou__ perfect ! i ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? __eou__ $ 800 dollars .
hi . i ’ m here for flight 514 returning to beijing but the board shows there is a delay.how long of a delay is expected ? __eou__ so far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__ do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__ i think you should stay in the airport . even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . who knows ? __eou__ what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ it seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . it happens all the time . no need to worry . __eou__ umm ... you know ... actually i was thinking of trying another airline . no need to hold my seat .
good morning . please come into my office . __eou__ good morning . thank you . __eou__ i see that you have some impressive writing experience . __eou__ yes . i have written for several top newspapers in the country . i ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel . __eou__ wonderful . i ’ d like to know why you ’ re interested in this position at our paper .
hi . i ’ m here for flight 513 to new york but i thought i heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . is that true ? __eou__ i ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but i ’ m afraid it is true . that flight has been canceled . would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__ no way ! i worked very hard so that i could leave on today ’ s flight . are there seats on another airline ? __eou__ it ’ s possible . if you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . __eou__ you mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! __eou__ that ’ s the one . it seems that everyone is anxious to get to new york tonight . __eou__ this is a rotten way to start a vacation . i hate lines ! can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__ certainly . you will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience .
we need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . __eou__ ok . let me send a memo around . __eou__ schedule it for this afternoon , when ken gets back . __eou__ i don ’ t think he ’ s back today . __eou__ oh , that ’ s right . go ahead anyways . i ’ ll fill him in . we can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! __eou__ i know , it ’ s a big one .
well , what did you think about the last candidate ? do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ she had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that i think a good manager needs . __eou__ what made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ she was a bit nervous , i guess . what else ? __eou__ when she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . i thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ you're right . if she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ it sure would . did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? she had horrible posture ! __eou__ i agree . i guess i was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ on top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__ that's true . i guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ don't worry , we'll find someone eventually !
hello , parker . how ’ s everything ? __eou__ can ’ t complain . and you ? __eou__ business is booming . i understand you want to meet up with me next week . how ’ s your schedule looking ? __eou__ let me see . i can come out and see you first thing wednesday . __eou__ great .
do you mind if i smoke here ? __eou__ yes , i do . i ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . the ac ( air-conditioning ) is also on . __eou__ can i just turn off the ac for now and open the window and smoke indoors ? __eou__ that ’ s not a very good idea . it ’ s quite hot outside . why don ’ t you smoke outside ? __eou__ it ’ s very hot and that ’ s why i ’ d like to smoke inside . __eou__ though the ac has the air-purifying function . i ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . are you okay with that ? __eou__ oh , no problem .
have you finished going through the contract ? __eou__ yes , but i have a few questions for you . __eou__ ok . ask away . __eou__ first , i ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . __eou__ yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . however , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . __eou__ even if i ’ m only sick for one day ? __eou__ that ’ s correct . __eou__ that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . __eou__ well , we ’ ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . __eou__ i see . i guess that makes sense . __eou__ do you have any other questions ? __eou__ yes . maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . do you offer anything to fathers ? __eou__ we do actually . we can add that as an amendment to your contract . __eou__ how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? __eou__ men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . __eou__ why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? __eou__ well , women are the ones giving birth . i think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? __eou__ i guess so . i don ’ t have any other questions . should i sign here then ? __eou__ yes , please .
do you have a minute ? __eou__ sure , what would you like to discuss ? __eou__ i've made a tough decision , sir . here's my resignation . __eou__ well , i have to tell you that i'm quite surprised . is there any possible way to change your mind ? __eou__ i'm afraid not , sir . i've made up my mind . it's something i have to do . __eou__ can i ask why ? were you unhappy working for us ? __eou__ oh , no . not at all . __eou__ are you planning on studying abroad ? __eou__ no , sir . __eou__ have you been given a better offer ? __eou__ oh , no . i would never look for another job while working here . i think this is a fantastic place to work . __eou__ well , what's the problem then ? __eou__ it's my mother . she's sick and needs someone to take care of her . i'm the only one who can do it . __eou__ i'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . why don't you just take a leave of absence ? we can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . __eou__ really ? i didn't know that would be possible . __eou__ sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . __eou__ thanks , sir .
how was your day ? __eou__ let ’ s start with you . how was yours ? __eou__ it was really busy . i had to work straight through my lunch break . __eou__ did you get to leave early then ? __eou__ my boss told me that i could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so i decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . __eou__ it was nice of your boss to give you an option . my boss would never do that . __eou__ let ’ s get back to you . how was your day ? __eou__ it was horrible ! it was just one thing after another . __eou__ you look pretty upset . are you ok ? __eou__ i ’ m fine . but i have bad news . __eou__ what ’ s that ? __eou__ i got sacked today . __eou__ you ’ re kidding ! how did that happen ? __eou__ well , i was late to work today . it was the third time i was late this week . __eou__ how late were you ? __eou__ only about 5 minutes . __eou__ you got fired for being a few minutes late ? __eou__ my boss is really picky about that . he never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . __eou__ oh well . you never really liked your boss anyway , did you ?
are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? __eou__ what ’ s to get ready ? __eou__ lots ! have you done any research about the company ? __eou__ nope . __eou__ have you updated your cv ? __eou__ nope .
amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? __eou__ sure . what do you need ? __eou__ well , i wanted to let you know that i've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? why ? __eou__ it's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i can't continue working for a company that may let me go . __eou__ but surely they won't fire you ! you're one of the most experienced managers here ! __eou__ well , to be honest , there's another reason . i've got a better offer . __eou__ well that's great news ! congratulations ! where will you be located ? __eou__ the head office is in new york , but i'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . __eou__ it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . __eou__ i have . i feel lucky . i look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use english more . __eou__ i'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? __eou__ of course i can . in fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , i'll recommend you personally . __eou__ thanks . i appreciate that .
are you ready for the meeting ? __eou__ yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? __eou__ it's challenging , but i'm enjoying it quite a bit . __eou__ that's great . i knew you'd do a good job as a manager . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ how's your assistant manager getting on ? __eou__ well , that's part of the problem . his probation period is up tomorrow and i don't think he's ready to pass . __eou__ what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . __eou__ if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? __eou__ to be honest , he has no authority . he's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . __eou__ i see . not everyone is cut out to work in management . __eou__ i know . it'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . __eou__ there's an opening in the creative design department . it involves working with computers . __eou__ that's perfect . i'll let him know tomorrow . thanks !
hello ? __eou__ good morning , nathaniel . this is leah calling from the international student office . __eou__ good morning . __eou__ the reason i'm calling is because ms . collins will not be able to call you back until next week . __eou__ oh . i had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . __eou__ she's terribly sorry about that . she had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . she hopes you understand . __eou__ is there someone else i can talk to ? __eou__ she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . when are you free today ? __eou__ any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . __eou__ mr . liu is available at 2:15 today . will that work for you ? __eou__ i'd prefer to speak with ms . fonda . __eou__ i'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . she has an opening at 11:30 this morning . will that work for you ? __eou__ that will be fine . __eou__ ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 . see you then .
hi , isaiah . how are you ? __eou__ i ’ m well . and you ? __eou__ fine . how ’ s your job going ? __eou__ i don ’ t know if i told you or not , but i decided to start my own business . __eou__ really ? that ’ s fantastic . what kind of business is it ? __eou__ i ’ ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from goldman sachs . __eou__ how ’ s it going ? __eou__ it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! __eou__ that ’ s such great news . i ’ m really happy for you ! where is your office located ? __eou__ our headoffice is here in beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . __eou__ where will those be located ? __eou__ if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in hong kong in april and another one in singapore in october . __eou__ when will you find out ? __eou__ we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . __eou__ well , good luck . i hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! __eou__ thanks !
how's your new job going ? __eou__ really well , thanks . __eou__ how are you finding your new boss ? __eou__ she's not bad . she's a bit bossy , but i'm sure i'll get used to her . __eou__ would you rather have her or your old boss back ? __eou__ she's far better than my old boss . he didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . __eou__ how about your new co-workers ? __eou__ they are all pretty easy-going . it's a very friendly place to work . __eou__ do you miss your old co-workers ? __eou__ of course . i spent so much time at my old workplace that i got to know them all very well . they were like family to me . __eou__ do people in different departments get along with each other ? __eou__ sure . since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . __eou__ do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? __eou__ yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . __eou__ do you like working in teams ? __eou__ i prefer it to working independently . i think most people do .
how's your job search going ? __eou__ i don't know . i only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__ i see . have you found anything that you're interested in ? __eou__ i've only found a few openings in my field . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ i'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . __eou__ there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? __eou__ unfortunately not . if i can't find anything in the field , then i could also work in the tourism field . __eou__ that's a good idea . you have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ by the way , i saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . __eou__ really ? what is it ? __eou__ it's a job at a recruitment agency . __eou__ that's interesting . do you think they'd hire me ? __eou__ well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . i think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! __eou__ that's true . i might as well call them up and see if i can get an interview . do you have the details ? __eou__ sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . good luck !
i don ’ t know what i ’ m going to do ! it ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if i lose my job ! __eou__ don ’ t worry . i don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . __eou__ it was a rather big mistake . when you work as an investment adviser , onc small mistake can cost the company millions . __eou__ but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? you were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . __eou__ that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . there ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . i ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing i can do about tha __eou__ let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . how much money do you have in your savings ? __eou__ i have enough to live off of for about 3 months . but i really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! i ’ d rather invest my money somehow . __eou__ well , that ’ s good . if you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . that will save you plenty of money . __eou__ that ’ s very generous of you . i guess that would work . __eou__ if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . if you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . __eou__ i guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . maybe losing my job would be a good thing !
hi , jane . how are you doing this morning ? __eou__ i ’ m all right , thanks . just a little tired . __eou__ late night ? __eou__ yeah , i got home around two .
hi there ! my name ’ s terry graham . you ’ re new around here , huh ? __eou__ yes . my name ’ s mark benson . i just started a couple of weeks ago . __eou__ well , if there ’ s anything i can do for you , let me know . __eou__ thanks , i appreciate that !
hi , my name's abby . what's your name ? __eou__ i'm colin . it's nice to meet you . what do you do ? __eou__ i'm a freelance english teacher . how about you ? __eou__ i'm in between jobs at the moment . __eou__ what kind of job are you looking for ? __eou__ i'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the it field . __eou__ have you ever thought about becoming a freelance it consultant ? __eou__ no . is it difficult to find such a job ? __eou__ not if you are good at net-working . do you like to meet new people ? __eou__ yes . i'm pretty out-going and friendly . __eou__ do you have experience in the it field ? __eou__ i have some . i worked in the it department at a language school for four years in spain . __eou__ do you speak spanish ? __eou__ yes , but not fluently . __eou__ that's ok . have you sent your cv out to anyone yet ? __eou__ i've sent my cv to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . __eou__ did you write a clear objective in your resume ? __eou__ no , because i didn't know what i wanted to do . __eou__ i think you need to update your cv . bring it over to my office tomorrow and i'll help you with it . __eou__ thanks , i will . i'll see you tomorrow then !
hi , betty.what ' s up ? __eou__ nothing special . how about you ? are you used to the life here in the states ? __eou__ everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__ great ! __eou__ well , i wish someone could talk to me about western table manners __eou__ sounds interesting . where did you get the idea ? __eou__ as you know , table manners in china are quite different from those of westerners . __eou__ absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__ for example , in china , it's okay to talk while eating . however , you may regard it as rude . __eou__ yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__ can you think of anything else ? __eou__ sure . we tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__ i didn't know that before . __eou__ and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__ i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__ don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__ i hope so .
how's your job search going ? __eou__ i only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__ have you finished compiling your resume ? __eou__ yes , i was precise with every word in my resume ? __eou__ that's good . don't forget to design the format . an attractive format is as important as the content . __eou__ absolutely , i've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . __eou__ good . how about your cover letter ? __eou__ a cover letter ? i've never thought about that . won't a cv do for my job application ? __eou__ no , a cv is not enough . you should also attach it with a cover letter . don't overlook it . you're faced with fierce competition in the job market . if your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of __eou__ sounds reasonable.even if i'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so i should try my best to catch the human resources manager's attention . __eou__ yes , you're right . all your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . __eou__ got it . i'll start right now .
i just received a phone call for an interview next week . __eou__ congratulations ! this is your first interview ever . __eou__ thank you , but i'm nervous . i don't know what to do.could you tell me what should i do before an interview ? __eou__ sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . __eou__ yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should i prepare ? __eou__ you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . it is important to show that you've done some research into the company . the interviewers wil __eou__ then what should i do when i'm being interviewed ? __eou__ smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview __eou__ are there any other things i should pay attention to ? __eou__ yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . that'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression .
have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? where else would you go ? __eou__ i would try to land a job in beijing . i just want to go to one of the big cities . __eou__ why ? __eou__ many say more development opportunities can be found there . __eou__ that's true . beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . __eou__ and there're higher salaries there . __eou__ well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . __eou__ i've considered that . i'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . __eou__ one person ? how about your girlfriend ? __eou__ oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in beijing . she insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . __eou__ sorry to hear that . it seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . __eou__ sure have . i want to offer my parents a better life ; so , i'll have to work very hard . __eou__ i admire you . good luck !
do you have s second ? __eou__ sure . what do you want ? __eou__ i want to tell you i've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? why ? __eou__ i've been thinking about this for several months , well before the spring festival holidays . __eou__ and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? __eou__ yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , i want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . i've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and i still haven't received __eou__ absolutely . with your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . __eou__ that's exactly why i decided to quit the job and find a new one . __eou__ this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . __eou__ that's right . i am not the only one who has done this . job hopping is quite common in the it industry . __eou__ that is to say , most it professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . i'm wondering why it companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead
what did you do at the office today ? __eou__ i had a really busy day . i had to work a little overtime . in the morning an important client called to place a large order . i had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . __eou__ what kind of things did you need to check ? __eou__ the most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . if the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . i also had to check the price . this customer is very important , so the __eou__ i see . did anything else happen ? __eou__ i received a lot of emails from potential clients that i had to answer . each time , i had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . each client has different conditions and required __eou__ it must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . __eou__ yes . that ’ s why we have everything on computer files . we don ’ t use much paper at our office . after lunch , i had to deal with a complaint form a client . __eou__ i hate dealing with complaints . was it a legitimate complaint ? __eou__ yes , it was . i managed to sort out the problem , but i was tied up with the matter for over an hour . __eou__ you certainly had a busy day . __eou__ that ’ s not all ! i also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . in the end , i finished everything . i wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning .
how time flies ! we have been in beijing for almost 4 years . __eou__ yes , i can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . i asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . __eou__ yeah , feels like yesterday . now i ’ m almost settled down here . we ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . __eou__ congratulations ! i hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , i ’ m still residing in beijing . __eou__ thank you . is your company going to move to other cities ? __eou__ no , i ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ well , i still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . __eou__ yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . __eou__ that ’ s right . i work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but i don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . __eou__ i understand your position . perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . you ’ ll feel much better with your family around . __eou__ yeah , i think so .
okay , well i ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . __eou__ yes , well miss childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details i ’ d like to clarify . __eou__ well feel free to ask me anything , and i ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__ could i first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__ yes , of course . that's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? as a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 hk dollars per annum . this doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al __eou__ i understand . and are there other bonuses included ? __eou__ well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . but we could go through all the details of that at a later date . __eou__ well , mr . parsons , i am flexible when it comes to salary . the opportunity to work in hong kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__ excellent.well , what other questions do you have rebecca ?
well rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? __eou__ i don ’ t think so , mr . parsons . i think you have covered all the main points for me . __eou__ okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . if any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . of course you can also call miss childs too . __eou__ great . rmm , when can i expect to hear from you ? __eou__ well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . miss childs will call you to discuss more on monday or tuesday . how does that so __eou__ that sounds perfect . thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me mr . parsons . __eou__ the pleasure ’ s all mine , rebecca . __eou__ i hope to hear from you very soon . __eou__ absolutely . thanks for coming rebecca . goodbye .
could you tell me a little about the organization ? for example , how big is your workforce here ? __eou__ well in total we have around 150 employees based in hong kong with another 400 in our head office in beijing . the news desk staff in hong kong comprises around 80 staff . __eou__ i see . and how about the working hours ? __eou__ well , as you know rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . you could be on call at any time . we do have to work very unsociable hours at times . __eou__ well i am used to that , mr . parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . __eou__ good , as long as you understand that . __eou__ and when do you need to fill the vacancy , mr . parsons ? __eou__ yesterday ! but no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . __eou__ that sounds ideal .
okay , now i ’ d like to find out more about your last job . i see you spent almost four years at the london weekly , is that right ? __eou__ yes , that ’ s right . to be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . i was really just treated more like an intern . i didn ’ t have many responsibilities and i found it quite frustrating . __eou__ so , what changed ? __eou__ well slowly but surely i proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . __eou__ wow , a real step up ! __eou__ yes , i was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . i spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism i wanted to stay in long-term . __eou__ i see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? __eou__ i just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . i really needed a more challenging role to be honest .
okay rebecca , well i think you ’ ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . __eou__ okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? __eou__ definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? __eou__ well as i mentioned before , i do tend to get frustrated if i don ’ t see progress in my work or career . i suppose i ’ m quite a restless character . my father always taught me to be a high achiever so . __eou__ so would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? __eou__ well , in a way yes . but i must say that even if i ’ m not completely happy in my work i always give 110 % i would never shirk my responsibilities . i suppose sometimes i expect too much too soon . __eou__ well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? __eou__ yes , please .
okay , rebecca . now you ’ ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? how would you describe your key strengths ? __eou__ well , mr . parsons , as i mentioned before i ’ m someone who needs new challenges . i ’ m really focused and hard-working . i think my academic results prove this . __eou__ yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? __eou__ well , i believe i ’ m a good team-player , but i can also work well independently . i ’ m very enthusiastic and , well i hope my colleagues would agree , i ’ m fun to work with . __eou__ what would you say is your most positive quality ? __eou__ hmm , that ’ s a tough question . but i would have to say my passion . i ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career .
now , if i look here i see that you completed a ba in english ? __eou__ yes , that ’ s right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english , and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 . __eou__ yes , i ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . __eou__ yes that ’ s right . i ’ ve always enjoyed studying . my friends say i ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . __eou__ well , it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ? __eou__ well i ’ ve always been keen on writing , so i became the editor for the university student magazine , which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter , to help the homeless in york . __eou__ what did that involve ? __eou__ providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . __eou__ i ’ m sure . okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? __eou__ yes , okay .
right rebecca . now i see that after graduating from university your first job was ... __eou__ for a local paper in york called the york herald . actually , i started with them as an intern in the beginning . i was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g __eou__ certainly . and after your internship ? __eou__ they seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . i ended up staying two years there actually . i was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . i really __eou__ yes i see . but you decided to leave them in 2006 right . __eou__ yes , that ’ s right . my husband and i moved to london , and so i managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in london . __eou__ the london weekly right . __eou__ yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future .
hi . could you give me a hand with this report ? __eou__ sure . i ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . __eou__ thanks . would you mind taking a look at the layout ? do you think it ’ s appropriate ? i want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . __eou__ it looks good to me . i would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . the bosses seem to like that . __eou__ that ’ s an excellent suggestion . i can easily do it on the computer . __eou__ why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? they ’ ll be more distinct . __eou__ i ’ ll take that suggestion too . how about the content ? __eou__ i think you ’ ve included all the essential things . you might want to make the conclusion a little longer . restate your reasons clearly . __eou__ is it ok to include the pictures ? __eou__ definitely ! i would include one or two on each page if possible . remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . __eou__ thanks for those ideas . i ’ ll get to work on them right away .
we ’ ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . we don ’ t want to make any mistakes . __eou__ ok . i should have it finished by friday afternoon . then i can check those account over the weekend . we need to have them finished by monday , right ? __eou__ that ’ s right . we ’ ll finish them just in time . the macy project can wait for the time being . we need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s __eou__ from next week on , we should be in less of a rush . __eou__ i ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . everyone deserves it . __eou__ don ’ t say that yet . a new project could suddenly appear . __eou__ that ’ s true . right . i ’ m going back to the meeting . it ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . __eou__ carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . __eou__ good . i have to go right now . i really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . __eou__ they usually go on for ages . __eou__ i ’ ll stop by if i have time later . make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . __eou__ i will . enjoy your meeting !
hello . how was the marketing meeting ? __eou__ hi . it was awful . i think i put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . __eou__ i ’ m surprised to hear that . i thought you had some very good suggestions . __eou__ so did i . i ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . __eou__ so what happened in the meeting ? __eou__ one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . that was to be expected . the worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . __eou__ i wonder why not . we could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . __eou__ that ’ s good advice , but i ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . __eou__ may i make a suggestion ? __eou__ sure . i ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . __eou__ is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? if they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . you won ’ t get credit for ide __eou__ i ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . __eou__ go on . take a chance . you could just hint at your idea . the client should be smart enough to take a hint .
what do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? __eou__ well , there are several things . of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . __eou__ so , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? __eou__ no . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . they will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . those things will increase you costs . __eou__ how can a business maximise revenues ? __eou__ you need to invest in some good advertising . you have to know where your potential customers are and target them . it ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . the market is too small . __eou__ what else do you suggest ? __eou__ find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . price yourself near the low end . don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . th
we ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? __eou__ that ’ s fine ... i need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should i see about that ? __eou__ see julie , the receptionist . she knows where all that stuff is kept . you might like a calendar for you desk . she can give you one of those too . __eou__ thanks . i need to make a few photocopies . __eou__ the photocopier is near my office . come on , i ’ ll show you where it is . __eou__ do you enjoy working in this office ? __eou__ yes , i do . everyone ’ s really friendly . sometimes , i wish i worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . __eou__ what ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? __eou__ we usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . the boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . it ’ s also a chance to put forward su
what ’ s your working day like ? __eou__ i have a typical 9 to 5 job . actually , i work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . __eou__ do you get paid onetime ? __eou__ no , i don ’ t . i get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts i sign with clients . __eou__ do you have any breaks ? __eou__ we have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . my boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . __eou__ my boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . i suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ there ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . do you work in a cubicle ? __eou__ yes , i do . i don ’ t like it very much . __eou__ i work in a cubicle too , but i i don ’ t mind it .
what do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? __eou__ first , i'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . he or she will know all the local laws and regulations . __eou__ that ’ s very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we ’ ll need someone to hire staff . __eou__ i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that . i don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . have we decide on the location of __eou__ yes . we have . we chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd . __eou__ why didn ’ t we choose an office in the cbd ? __eou__ the offices there were too expensive . have we negotiated any contracts yet ? __eou__ yes . we ’ ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . we hope to sign another three this month . __eou__ when will the branch office open ? __eou__ hopefully next month . everything is a little rushed . we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . __eou__ has and advertising campaign been prepared ? __eou__ yes , it has . we ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines . __eou__ i made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . we should be able to get plenty of customers .
welcome to abc electronics . first , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . __eou__ ok . i understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? __eou__ that ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . the lunch break is flexible . you can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . __eou__ that ’ s fine . is it ok to have a coffee break during the working day ? __eou__ of course . the main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . we even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . __eou__ how often do you have meetings ? __eou__ you should attend a department meeting every monday morning . there are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee __eou__ i ’ ve met some of my colleagues already . i ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together . __eou__ you are entitled to a company car . have you seen it yet ? __eou__ i was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . __eou__ ok . this is your cubicle . at first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . later , you ’ ll be working more independently . __eou__ that ’ s fine . i need to learn how you do things here first . salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? __eou__ that ’ s right . make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible .

can you squeeze me in sometime today ? __eou__ that ’ s a big order , jane . i am really swamped . __eou__ i know what you ’ re saying , but i have to go over the books with you before i go see our tax guy . __eou__ right . okay , let me see what i can do . how about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? it won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ?

i ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , mr . cranial . i ’ d like to accommodate you , but i just don ’ t think i ’ ll have the time . __eou__ are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? __eou__ not at all , sir . i ’ d just like to push it up to next week . i ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . __eou__ well , i don ’ t like it , but i guess i don ’ t have any choice .

hey , could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ? __eou__ the most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . do you know all about them ? __eou__ yes , i pretty much understand the company . __eou__ well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . have you decided what they are yet ? __eou__ yes , i've been observing them . __eou__ when you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . have you chosen what to wear ? __eou__ i already have something to wear . __eou__ i would always be ready to go shopping with you ! should we talk about other basics ? __eou__ ok , i am ready to think of other things . __eou__ you need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . you'll do great !
i am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview . __eou__ make sure that you understand the company . do you understand what it is that they do ? __eou__ no , i probably need to do some more research . __eou__ when you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . does that make sense ? __eou__ i think that their attitude is rather casual . __eou__ so all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . do you have something to wear ? __eou__ i have absolutely nothing so far . __eou__ you know i could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? __eou__ yes , where should we go from here ? __eou__ focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . i'm sure you'll do well .

hello . excuse me . __eou__ yes . can i help you ? __eou__ do you remember me ? i just had lunch here a half hour ago . __eou__ of course i remember you . __eou__ i think i lost my wallet here . __eou__ oh , no . really ? i didn't see anything . __eou__ really ? you didn't find a wallet ? __eou__ no , i didn't . would you like to go look by the table with me ? __eou__ yes , i would . it's not here . and it's not on the floor.has anyone sat at this table since we left ? __eou__ no . it's been empty the whole time . __eou__ hmm . i don't know how it could have happened . __eou__ i remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.you didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? __eou__ no . my friend did . __eou__ then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? __eou__ no , i'm not sure . but i usually take out my wallet when i sit down.it ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . so i usually put it next to me on the table . __eou__ maybe you lost it before you came here . or maybe you left it at home . __eou__ i don't think it's at home . i think i had it when i left the house.but what should i do ? __eou__ well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . __eou__ should i call the police ? __eou__ you can if you want . but the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . __eou__ hmm . i'll go home and check . maybe you're right . maybe it's at home . __eou__ i'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . __eou__ thanks for your help .
oh , my god ! what's this ? __eou__ what ? __eou__ look ! this window is open . __eou__ did you open it before we left ? __eou__ are you kidding ? it's winter . why would i open it ? __eou__ i don't know . wait . is this yours ? __eou__ no ! oh , my god ! someone has broken into the house . __eou__ it looks that way . that's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__ i locked it when i left though . __eou__ yes , but the robber broke in.then , when he left , he left through the door . so it wasn't locked . __eou__ i don't care about that , allen ! what did he steal ? that's the question ! __eou__ look around . __eou__ the tv's still here . __eou__ and your stereo too . so what did he steal ? we have to go look upstairs . __eou__ but what if someone's still up there ? __eou__ i don't think there will be . he left through the door , remember ?
there's someone coming . __eou__ it took them four minutes to get here . that was pretty fast . __eou__ yes , it's fast . but four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . __eou__ i guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.it looks like the back of the house was burning . __eou__ i wonder if anyone can call the ridleys about this . do you know them well ? __eou__ not really . __eou__ do you know where they're vacationing ? __eou__ i think they went to mexico , but i'm not sure.it ' s a bad thing to return home to.they ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . __eou__ yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.it ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . don't you think ? __eou__ yes , i suppose . it's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping .
hi ! what are you watching ? __eou__ it ’ s a programme about islam . it ’ s very interesting . __eou__ wow ! so many people ! where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ they are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . muslims call this pilgrimage haj . __eou__ why do they go there ? __eou__ muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ when muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ that ’ s right . unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ i heard about that . the pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ that ’ s right . that ’ s when accidents often happen . the saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ yes . in england , christian pilgrims might go to canterbury and many christians go to the vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ i think that place is lourdes . there are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ personally . i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . i don ’ t think place is magical in any way .
are you watching another news report about the war ? __eou__ yes . the two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . several military target were destroyed by bombing . many civilians were among the dead and wounded . __eou__ how did this war start ? __eou__ bout side claim a small area of territory . both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . __eou__ politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . neither side wants to compromise . __eou__ relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . several european countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . __eou__ what do you think will happen ? __eou__ both countries are very poor . soon they will run out of money to finance the war . then , perhaps , they will negotiate . __eou__ it would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first .
what do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ i ’ d say the main reason is poverty . countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . if their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . __eou__ it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end . __eou__ how do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ i don ’ t think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . the thing is to find the real pro __eou__ so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ yes . it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive . __eou__ the problem is that many poor people might suffer .

hey , john ! what do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ it's hard to say ! but it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . people from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . it seems they will never end . __eou__ how do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ i don't think that there is any easy way . __eou__ i think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support . __eou__ yeah , you are right !
how do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ i don't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . __eou__ so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.if the problem is resources , share them . __eou__ it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . __eou__ yes , it is.one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
excuse me for being late to work . __eou__ where have you been ? __eou__ my car broke down . __eou__ that's too bad . please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again . __eou__ yes , i'll work on it . __eou__ thank you , have a seat . we are working on the new project __eou__ great ! fill me in . __eou__ let's take a look at the campbell project . __eou__ i don't understand the projected revenues . __eou__ let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand .

good afternoon , mr meng . it's a little late for you , isn't it ? __eou__ hello , miao ping . yes , i've been stuck in back to back meetings all day , but i really wanted to come and speak to you . __eou__ what can i help you with ? __eou__ i'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . do you have any ideas ? __eou__ mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . too risky ! how about open-ended funds ? __eou__ yes , i've heard about that . isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? __eou__ exactly . then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . and , we provide a professional fund manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . __eou__ how can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? __eou__ our investment financing service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . __eou__ is this the information here ? well , let's take a look then ...
right , let me run through your options . you can go ahead and cash your undue large-amount deposit certificate if you really want to , but i'd recommend a personal durable commodities loan . __eou__ ok , what does that entail ? __eou__ it's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . if you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . __eou__ yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . i'll probably need about 25,000 rib . will that be a problem ? __eou__ not at all , mr zu . as the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . __eou__ i'm glad you thought of this . i'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! and i suppose i can use the money from the certificate to pay back this personal durable commodities loan and i won't lose any interest , right ? __eou__ exactly right . if you'd like to go ahead , i can process that for you now , mr zu . __eou__ absolutely , jenny . thanks very much , i think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
hello , and welcome to iba . which service do you require ? __eou__ hello , shelly , is it ? i'm here on behalf of my company , so i'll need the corporate banking services . __eou__ that's no problem ; i can take care of that for you . __eou__ i need to have a credit check done for my company . __eou__ if it's this kind of consultancy service , i'll have to direct you to another department , i'm afraid . __eou__ that's no problem . do you offer any other consulting services ? __eou__ there are many services you can choose from . why don't you take a look at this leaflet while i find someone who can help you ? __eou__ great . i'll wait right here , thanks .
consumer credit department . how may i help you ? __eou__ i need some info on car loans . such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . __eou__ certainly . do you currently bank with us ? __eou__ yes , i do . i have a current account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . __eou__ that's excellent . well , for our personal automobile consumer loan we offer some really competitive rates . the maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . __eou__ i plan to repay it within 2 years . and the interest ? __eou__ of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % __eou__ so the rate is variable ? ok , that's fine . how about the frequency of repayment ? __eou__ we usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . and since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . __eou__ that's nice and easy . thanks for your time .
welcome to iba consumer credit . what can i assist you with ? __eou__ my family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . __eou__ that's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . that's why we have just started a new scheme ; a personal automobile consumer loan . __eou__ great , i just hope i qualify ! could you tell me some more ? can i use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? __eou__ what we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . if it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . __eou__ then i can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? __eou__ yes . when you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . as long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . __eou__ what do you require ? __eou__ a correctly filled in application form , id card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ that sounds fine . if you could give me the name and address of the dealer i'll go over there now and see what they've got .
hi , buddy ! how do you deal with your salary ? __eou__ i usually put them into my bank account . i think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . __eou__ look ! this stock is rising now . i am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . __eou__ have you invested in the stock market before ? __eou__ no . this is my first time to buy some . you can see that its historical price data is rising now . __eou__ but that is a little risky , you know . __eou__ hey ! do you still remember our teacher of economics , mr . locker ? __eou__ of course ! i remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . __eou__ i can ask for some advice from him .
this is lincoln bank , consumer credit department . how can i help you ? __eou__ ah , hello . i'm calling to find out how i apply for a car loan . __eou__ we offer a personal automobile consumer loan . the application process is pretty straight forward . i trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? __eou__ yes , i do . it's ready and waiting in my account . __eou__ the next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... __eou__ could i just stop you there ? sorry to interrupt , but i have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car i want . __eou__ that will certainly cut down the processing time . we can move on to the next step . do you have the purchase price ? __eou__ yes , it's 110,000 rib . so , with the down payment done , i will need to borrow 70,000 rib . __eou__ what we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , id card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ yes , i have everything here . ok , i'll come in and see you later today . maybe i could have my new car as early as next week ! how exciting !
hello , welcome to credit services . how can we help you ? __eou__ i'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . __eou__ are you an existing customer ? __eou__ yes , i've had a current account with a debit card with you for years . now , i'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . __eou__ may i ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? most young people jump at the chance . __eou__ when i opened the account with you , i was a student , i graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so i figured now would be the best time to go ahead . __eou__ that's very sensible of you . we have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . __eou__ as you can see from the statements for my current account , i have never been overdrawn . i'm always very careful about that .
credit services , how can i help you ? __eou__ i'd like to apply for a credit card with you . __eou__ would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? __eou__ oh , i'm not sure . what's the difference ? __eou__ well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 rib , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 rib . __eou__ why such a big difference ? __eou__ it's all about credit rating and salary . if your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . __eou__ my salary is pretty high and i've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . are there any perks of the platinum card ? __eou__ yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . __eou__ that's great ; my health club membership is about to expire .
welcome to lincoln bank . what can we do for you ? __eou__ morning . i'm a new user of your credit card and i was wondering if i'm taking full advantage of it . __eou__ well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . __eou__ yes , of course . it's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays i hardly ever use cash . i just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . __eou__ you know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . __eou__ really ? __eou__ yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . __eou__ so , if for some reason i was having a bad month and spent a little too much i could just pay the minimum ? __eou__ yes . as long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . __eou__ how so ? __eou__ for example , if your credit limit is 5,000 rib and you owe 1,000 rib , your available credit will be 4,000 rib . so , your credit limit drops . __eou__ oh , i see . well , i don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that i can if i had to . thanks for that .
welcome to credit services . how can i help you ? __eou__ hello . i'm here to talk about my credit card . you see , i'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . i've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . __eou__ right . well , the benefits are a little different . with our corporate card you can use it for agency collection and payment . __eou__ is there anything else ? __eou__ there's quite a long list , actually ! you can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . __eou__ and i suppose i can do that anywhere ? i do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . __eou__ if you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions . __eou__ in just one document ? that will definitely be a time saver .
it's mrs bardot , isn't it ? __eou__ yes , it is . but i'm afraid we haven't met before . __eou__ i'm greg wu , head of consultancy . i see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . is that right ? __eou__ hello greg . yes , that's correct . you see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . it's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . __eou__ i see . so , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? __eou__ that's right . i feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what i mean . __eou__ i couldn't agree more . if you have the company details with you i can get on with that right away . is there anything else that you need from us today ? __eou__ the lady at the desk , shelly i think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . __eou__ we do indeed . such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . __eou__ that's good to know . thanks for your help today , i'll leave you with the details and you can get started .
welcome to the consultancy department , i'm greg wu . what can i assist you with today ? __eou__ i need to do a credit investigation on another company , but i'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . __eou__ how so ? __eou__ well , it's an american company , you see . i'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . __eou__ we are able to do credit investigations globally . you have no need to worry . __eou__ really ? i have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside china . __eou__ 10 years ago , maybe yes . but nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . __eou__ i'm not exactly prepared right now . how about i go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? __eou__ i'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . __eou__ i'll return at about 4:30 pm . see you then .
welcome to iba . what can we assist you with today ? __eou__ hello . yes , i've just read your leaflet about the new moneylink card . i was wondering how i go about applying for one . __eou__ this scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . __eou__ that does sound good . i'm already an account holder , have been for many years . and i already have your existing card . __eou__ that should make things perfectly simple , then . actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . __eou__ perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! so , i can just upgrade automatically ? __eou__ may i have your details , and i'll check for you . __eou__ certainly ... __eou__ ok , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . that means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . __eou__ wonderful ! and , you mentioned ' perks ' ? i do hope i'll be getting some of those .
hello ! so , you're back . do you have everything with you ? __eou__ i think so . __eou__ we will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ... __eou__ yes , yes . i've got all of that here . __eou__ and also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number . __eou__ check , check and check . __eou__ what's the purpose for this check ? would you like to know its repayment capacity ? __eou__ yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . when do you think i can get hold of this report ? __eou__ as it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . there is , of course a service fee of 300 rib to be paid . __eou__ no problem , i'll settle that now . you can take it from my business account .
good morning , sir . can i help you with something ? __eou__ i hope so . i'm not actually a customer here , but i saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . __eou__ i see . yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . would you like to apply for a card with us ? __eou__ yes , please . but i suppose i'll have to open an account with you first , right ? __eou__ that's right . but don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . __eou__ could i open an account with you today ? __eou__ of course , it can be done right this minute . if you could just fill in this application form for me ? do you have your id card with you ? i'll need to see that . __eou__ yes , here you go . and sign here ? __eou__ yes , please . that's being processed now . as soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . __eou__ so quick and easy ! thanks very much .
iba , jane speaking . how can i help you ? __eou__ hello . i'd like to speak to someone regarding my card . __eou__ sorry , i'm not quite sure if i understand . in what way , sir ? has your card been stolen ? __eou__ no , no . nothing at all like that . it's just that i applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but i'm still waiting for my card . __eou__ oh , i see , sir . well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card . __eou__ yes , my application was accepted last friday . now it's wednesday , that's more than 5 days . __eou__ sorry , sir , but it's 5 working days . this does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week . __eou__ of course ! how silly of me ! yes , 5 working days would mean this friday , at the earliest . i see . i'm sorry to trouble you . __eou__ it's no trouble at all , sir . is there anything else i can help you with today ? __eou__ nothing , thanks . i again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now .

welcome to iba . what can i do for you today ? __eou__ i'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . __eou__ no problem . could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? __eou__ here it is . i usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . __eou__ yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . we will be putting in a new atm in the near future , though . that should help to ease the queues . __eou__ i'll look forward to that , i can't stand queuing . __eou__ i know what you mean . how much would you like to deposit with us today ? __eou__ 1,000 rib , it should all be there . __eou__ that's correct , 1,000 rib . i'll need your personal code to deposit this . could you enter it on this key pad , please ? __eou__ ok , done . when will it show in my account ? not for withdrawal , i mean just registered . __eou__ it will show in your account straight away . here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ? __eou__ that's fine . ok . thanks .
welcome . what can i do for you this morning ? __eou__ i'm here on holiday and i don't have a local debit card . is it possible to withdraw money on my visa credit card here ? __eou__ well , welcome to our country . i trust you are having a pleasant stay ? __eou__ oh , yes . it's amazing here . i don't think i ever want to go home again ! __eou__ that's the opinion of most people . do you have your passport with you ? i'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . __eou__ fine . here you go . __eou__ how much would you like to withdraw ? __eou__ is it ok to withdraw usd ? __eou__ that's fine . __eou__ ok , 200 usd , please . __eou__ here's your money , your card and your passport . please double check the amount for me . __eou__ perfect . thanks !
welcome . what can i do for you , madam ? __eou__ i hope you can give me some advice . i'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . it's such a long way from my home , but i checked and you are my nearest branch . is there anyway i can do it from home ? __eou__ that's terrible . unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . what i'd advise you to do is set up a direct debit service . __eou__ a direct debit service ? what's that exactly ? __eou__ a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . __eou__ but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean , i receive my bills , not you . __eou__ we set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . __eou__ i see . so , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? that does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
welcome to lincoln bank . what can i help you with , sir ? __eou__ i'm not sure if i'm at the right counter , but i need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? __eou__ unfortunately , no , i can't . but our specialist can . please take a seat and our mortgage adviser will come out to see you . __eou__ a specialist ? that's excellent , thanks . __eou__ no problem , sir . he'll be with you in just a minute . could i get you something to drink while you are waiting ? __eou__ a black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks .
i'm the mortgage advisor at this branch . you wanted a chat about housing loans ? __eou__ yes , i've found a wonderful property i wish to buy . unfortunately , i just don't have access to the cash . __eou__ i see . it's a problem most of us face . may i ask what the purchase price is ? __eou__ it's 600,000 rib . but i've already put down 200,000 rib , which is my absolute limit , so i'm looking for a loan of 400,000 rib . __eou__ so , you've already made a large initial deposit ? that is good news . ok , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started . __eou__ i already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . __eou__ that is good , it should speed things up nicely .
welcome to iba . do you need any assistance ? __eou__ yes , please . i'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates . __eou__ i see . we offer personal housing loans , or mortgages , at a rate of 0.42 % per month . __eou__ that's pretty much the same as i've been quoted at other banks . __eou__ we offer many different payment plans . would you be looking at long-term or short-term ? are you looking at a 10 - year repayment plan ? __eou__ definitely . i want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as i can . __eou__ then we can certainly help you with that . you see , for shorter term loans , we can offer an even more competitive interest rate . __eou__ mmmm ... that does sound interesting . is there anyone available i can talk with about this in more detail ? __eou__ i'll get our mortgage adviser for you . please take a seat , i won't be a minute .
may i help you at all ? __eou__ yes , please . my son wants to go overseas , to england , to do his master degree . i wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? __eou__ we certainly do . i can give you some details about a loan called personal loan for studying abroad . we offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . __eou__ i see . what does it entail ? i'm not sure if we will be eligible . __eou__ this loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . __eou__ so , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? __eou__ that's right . the sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . the guidelines are not so strict , you see . __eou__ that is good to know . just think ! we've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . thank you .
good day ! what can we do for you ? __eou__ i'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . __eou__ buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . __eou__ that's great . i'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . __eou__ with our personal automobile consumer loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__ that's good news . the car i'm interested in is priced at 120,000 rib , but i think i can get a bit of discount on that . i can afford to put up around 40,000 rib myself . __eou__ that's great . you will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . __eou__ the funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it .
personal loans , how may i help ? __eou__ i'm going to be studying overseas next year and i'd like some info about suitable loans . to be honest , i'm not even sure if i can get a loan . __eou__ not a problem . we offer a personal loan for studying abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . anyone is eligible to apply __eou__ would i have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? __eou__ not exactly . our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . __eou__ i see . what about age limitations ? __eou__ there are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . __eou__ got it ! i fit into that category very nicely . that's great ! i'll have a chat with my parents and come back . thanks very much .
welcome to lincoln bank . what can we do for you today ? __eou__ hello . i called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . she said to come in as soon as i had the chance , as this must be done in person . i'd like to apply today . __eou__ ok , that's absolutely fine . i will need to see some credentials before we can get started . do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? __eou__ yes , yes . it's all here . there you go . i'm not sure if i need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do i ? __eou__ you do , i'm afraid . there are 3 ways to do this . you can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . __eou__ yes , i read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . i'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . __eou__ right , that's no problem . i see you are already well informed . if you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . __eou__ ok , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . thanks .
did you need help with something ? __eou__ i don ’ t know where to get my ballot . __eou__ i can help you with that . __eou__ how can you help me ? __eou__ i work here . __eou__ that ’ s great . __eou__ may i see your id ? __eou__ here it is . __eou__ all right , here is your ballot card . __eou__ what do i do now ? __eou__ go to a voting booth and vote . __eou__ all right . thanks for your help .

will you be voting this year ? __eou__ of course ! will you ? __eou__ this is going to be my first time voting . __eou__ are you serious ? __eou__ i ’ m not sure what i ’ m doing . __eou__ voting is easy . __eou__ i don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . __eou__ the ballot gives you all that information . __eou__ nobody told me that before . __eou__ you have nothing to worry about . __eou__ i ’ m so glad you told me that . __eou__ good luck on your first election .
i am really excited ! __eou__ why are you so excited ? __eou__ i just got done voting . __eou__ this was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ? __eou__ i just turned 18 last month . __eou__ that is so lucky of you . __eou__ why ? __eou__ you turned 18 a month before the election . __eou__ i didn ’ t think of it that way . __eou__ are you serious ? __eou__ seriously , but i ’ m excited that i did . __eou__ congratulations on being a part of history .
did you vote yesterday ? __eou__ i sure did ! __eou__ what candidate did you vote for ? __eou__ i voted for obama . __eou__ i ’ m shocked he actually won . __eou__ i knew he would win . __eou__ how ’ d you know ? __eou__ he was the best candidate this year . __eou__ what about him being black ? __eou__ i guess america is finally maturing . __eou__ i think you have a point .
i am so excited ! __eou__ excited about what ? __eou__ i just voted . __eou__ is this the first time you ’ ve voted ? __eou__ yes , i just had my 18th birthday this year . __eou__ that ’ s lucky . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ you turned 18 in an election year . __eou__ i didn ’ t think about it like that . __eou__ really ? __eou__ no , but that makes me even more excited . __eou__ you ’ re a part of history .
can you tell that i ’ m excited ? __eou__ what are you excited about ? __eou__ i voted today . __eou__ was this your first time ? __eou__ i just turned 18 a month ago . __eou__ you ’ re lucky . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ because you turned 18 in an election year . __eou__ i didn ’ t even think of that . __eou__ you didn ’ t ? __eou__ i really didn ’ t , but i ’ m still excited . __eou__ you should be , because you ’ re a part of history .
did you vote ? __eou__ of course ! __eou__ who was your vote for president ? __eou__ my vote was for barack obama . __eou__ i didn ’ t expect him to win . __eou__ i had no doubt in my mind that he would win . __eou__ what made you think that ? __eou__ nobody could compete with him . __eou__ i thought his race would have kept him from winning . __eou__ times are changing . __eou__ that ’ s true . __eou__ i support our new president 100 % .
national trust . __eou__ my name is alice lin , and i need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . __eou__ just one second , and i'll check . __eou__ thank you .
union bank . how can i be of service ? __eou__ i need to know how much money is in my account . __eou__ i'll need your name and account number . __eou__ certainly .
you voted , right ? __eou__ you know i did . __eou__ who did you vote for ? __eou__ i voted for obama , of course ! __eou__ can you believe that he actually won ? __eou__ i knew he would win . __eou__ i didn ’ t think he would . __eou__ he was the top candidate . __eou__ i figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s african american . __eou__ that just goes to show that america is finally turning over a new leaf . __eou__ you ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ i ’ m excited that barack obama is our president .
hello , there . you are looking a little confused ; can i help you with something ? __eou__ well , i've always used the bank book , but now i have this card . i don't know how to use it in the machine . __eou__ don't worry ; i can help you with that . i understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . the first thing we need to do is check the atm is in service . this one is fine . __eou__ yes , i sure can . i feel like a dinosaur with all of these youngsters and their electronics . this machine is working , then ? __eou__ yes , this one is in service . put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . then you will see some instructions on the screen . __eou__ oh , it wants me to put in my pin number . ok , i can do that ... __eou__ and press ' enter ' to confirm , here . now you need to decide which service you need . __eou__ there are so many to choose from . i didn't know you could do all of this using a card . __eou__ that's the beauty of these machines , you can do almost anything . and unlike a person , they don't usually take breaks or go off sick !
i hope you can help . i've got a bit of a problem with your atm . __eou__ of course , that's my job . oh , dear . what's happened ? __eou__ well , it's eaten my card ! it won't give it back ! __eou__ i see ... calm down , don't worry . may i ask what were you doing when it took your card ? __eou__ yes . i was only entering my pin . i'm terrible at remembering it , i'm so forgetful , you see . __eou__ mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ? __eou__ maybe three times . as i said , i always forget it . __eou__ ah ! don't worry ; it's just a security measure . if someone uses a card and cannot get the right pin after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you . __eou__ oh , i see . so if i call my branch they can sort everything out for me ? __eou__ yes , they'll be happy to help . believe me , it happens to many people . __eou__ i'd better try harder to memorise my pin in future . thanks .
good morning , madam . is everything ok ? is there something i can assist you with ? __eou__ thank you , yes . i'm not sure how to use this atm , i usually go to a clerk and use my bank book . but today , i thought i'd try something new . i want to take some money out . __eou__ welcome to the electronic age ! i can run you through it ; it's what i'm here for . __eou__ thanks so much . right , i've put my card in . what now ? __eou__ just look at the screen here . it'll give you prompts , you see ? now you need to enter your pin number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . __eou__ then it'll give me my money ? __eou__ not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . the next thing is to select the service . __eou__ here we are ' withdrawal ' , so i just press here ? __eou__ yes , then enter the amount you want . __eou__ oh , as simple as that ! i shall never wait for a real person again , these machines are wonderful .

welcome to lincoln bank . which service do you require today ? __eou__ i'm here to ask about a loan . __eou__ we have many loans on offer . may i ask what the purpose of the loan is ? __eou__ i got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . i'd like to buy a car for the family . __eou__ i see . what you need is one of our petty consumer loans . __eou__ could you tell me what the requirements are for that , please ? __eou__ certainly . it's quite simple really . do you hold a resident's permit ? __eou__ yes , i do . i was born and bred here . __eou__ that's great . we'll also need details of your occupation . __eou__ i have all of that with me . i've also banked here for a number of years .
welcome to lincoln bank . are you a new customer ? __eou__ yes , i am . i opened an account with you about a month ago , but today i'm here to see about a loan of some kind . __eou__ i see . as you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you . __eou__ yes , that's fine . my credit is good ; i banked at my former bank for many years . __eou__ may i ask why you decided to switch your account to us ? __eou__ haha ! actually , i felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer . plus , i've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy . __eou__ we always welcome new business . if you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin . __eou__ i have everything right here . i'll let you go through that and come back . i'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure i make the right choice .
as an existing banker , that will speed up the process . you said you had the documents with you ? __eou__ that's right . here you go . __eou__ before i verify those , i need you to fill in some forms . then , as i said , i need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... __eou__ ok , as i expected . how much will you allow me to borrow ? i mean , i don't need a massive sum of money . __eou__ you are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 rib , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . __eou__ that'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . __eou__ we can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . __eou__ how soon before this goes through ? __eou__ if you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . __eou__ perfect . so , i guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . thanks for everything .
good afternoon . what can i do for you today , madam ? __eou__ it's a little sensitive , actually . i need to get hold of some money , and quickly . __eou__ ok , madam . we are here to help . __eou__ i already have some time deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . i really don't want to cash those just yet . __eou__ i understand completely . there are other options , such as a personal pledge loan . __eou__ i've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? __eou__ the procedure is really simple and convenient . all you need to do is fill in this loan application form . __eou__ right ... anything else ? __eou__ of course , we'll need some documentation from you . like your resident permit , proof of salary and your usd deposit certificate , to use as collateral . __eou__ and then i just sign here ? you're right ! it certainly is simple and extremely convenient .
welcome back , sir . i trust the materials were helpful to you ? __eou__ indeed . i've decided to go for the petty consumer loan . that is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . __eou__ your credit is fine , sir . now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ? __eou__ i've just bought a second hand apartment and i'm looking to do some renovations . you know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy . __eou__ i see . and what loan amount are you expecting ? __eou__ it says here that the maximum is 20,000 rib . is that flexible ? __eou__ i'm sorry , sir . the maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20,000 rib , with no exceptions . __eou__ well , 20,000 rib , it'll have to be then . __eou__ i need some documentation from you . such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and i already have your credit details here . __eou__ everything is right here . if that's all in order , just let me know where i sign .
loans department , how can i help you ? __eou__ hello . could you give me some details about your personal pledge loans , please ? __eou__ certainly , sir . i'd be happy to . the personal pledge loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , time deposits , for example , or visible treasury bonds . __eou__ so , as long as i have one of those , i can apply for a personal pledge loan ? __eou__ that's correct , sir . the bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities . __eou__ mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? __eou__ the maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral . __eou__ and the maximum loan amount ? __eou__ the initial amount is just 2,000 rib , but we can go up to 100,000 rib . but remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral . __eou__ ok . i'll have a look at what i've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . thanks for your help . bye . __eou__ my pleasure , sir . bye .
hello , this is iba bank . maria speaking , how may i help ? __eou__ hi , i'm looking into your loans and i'm a little confused about the interest rates . could you give me some advice ? __eou__ not a problem . which loan was it you were interested in ? sorry , i must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__ i understand . i'm interested in the petty consumer loan . __eou__ one of our most popular ! the usual interest rate is fixed by the pbc . that is the people's bank of china . but of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . __eou__ so , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the pbc ? __eou__ that is correct . __eou__ i'm going to have to do some more research into this . thanks for your help , bye for now .

mr moon , how good to see you again . __eou__ hello , miao ping , i'm here to chat with you about corporate agreement savings . what can you tell me ? __eou__ well , corporate agreement savings will be based on the agreement deposit contract signed by the customer and the bank together . so , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . so , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of current deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . __eou__ what if i exceed ? __eou__ if it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the people's bank of china on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . __eou__ right , i see . it all sounds pretty complicated to me . i think i'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what i want to do .
after you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . __eou__ miao ping , if i do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if i exceed be counted ? __eou__ it is higher than the rate of interest for current deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . __eou__ so , if i do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a corporate agreement savings plan with you ? __eou__ first of all , you need to sign a corporate agreement savings contract with us . this means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . __eou__ ok , let's get the ball rolling on this .
hi , how can i help ? __eou__ i was told to come over to this window if i want to make a withdrawal . i'm not withdrawing from a current account , you see . i want to withdraw from my certificate of deposit . __eou__ unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your c / d before the pre-decided date , you must give notice . __eou__ oh , i see . will i lose any money if i decide to withdraw on it now ? __eou__ yes , you will lose interest . i see that you have a 5 - year c / d with us . i'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity . __eou__ oh dear . well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done .
are you here to make a deposit mr hayes ? __eou__ no , nancy , today i'm here to make a withdrawal . i made a formal request 7 days ago . __eou__ you want to withdraw on your time deposit , right ? __eou__ that's correct . but before i do , i was wondering if you could give me some advice . __eou__ of course , mr hayes . that's what i'm here for . what would you like to know ? __eou__ maybe i'm making a big mistake cashing in my time deposit before maturity . __eou__ this bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . would it be possible to take the money from your current account , for example ? __eou__ no , not really . my current account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it .

ok , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits . __eou__ good idea . how much do i need to deposit ? __eou__ for agreement savings , we ask for 100,000 rib . __eou__ and how do i withdraw if i need to ? __eou__ you can use a type a agreement savings account the same was as a settlement account . __eou__ i'm sorry , refresh my mind . what's different about a type b account ? __eou__ with a type b account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service .

foreign currency deposits counter , yes . what can i do for you ? __eou__ you see , i have these euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . so i'd like to save them in my account , but i'm not sure how to go about it . __eou__ ok . we offer 2 types of saving systems , time savings and demand savings . with time savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with demand savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time . __eou__ i see . what's the interest like on those ? __eou__ there's quite a large difference . i mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % . __eou__ yes , i couldn't agree with you more . a 1 year time deposit it is !

hello , sir . what can i do for you today ? __eou__ i need to find a new way of getting my insurance . __eou__ we've just started a new business at this bank , bank-insurance link . __eou__ could you give me some details about that ? __eou__ certainly . it could really benefit someone like you . besides insurance for you , you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company . __eou__ that sounds great . more dividends if i want to purchase them ! __eou__ there are two different types that we are offering at the moment , dividend deposit and dividend participated deposit . __eou__ i'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . thanks .
hello , sir . so , you are back ? __eou__ yes , hello again . i would like to know the exact difference between dividend deposit and dividend participated deposit . __eou__ that's pretty easy to explain . with the deposit , the interest is fixed , but the dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . the longer the term , the higher the dividend you earn . this is because it is calculated at the compound interest rate . __eou__ and i can purchase that here ? __eou__ yes . and if you already have a current account with us , the insurance premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
hi there . how can i help ? __eou__ i started a new job last month and i'm expecting my first salary . __eou__ i see . and your company has a wage distribution service agreement with us ? __eou__ so i was told , yes . they gave me this book ? __eou__ yes , that's a current-all-in-one passbook . that's what you need to get your salary .

you've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ? __eou__ to be honest , i haven't really done much research . __eou__ i would recommend that you at least glance through these brochures , just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you . take your time , sir . __eou__ thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials i've decided not to go with my initial choice . __eou__ of course , sir . if i could have your details again and your id , i'll check them and we can go on .

mr brown ! how nice to see you , can i help ? __eou__ i'm not exactly sure if it's your department , but i'd like to ask some questions about qualifying for comprehensive credit granting . __eou__ i see . you are one of my favourite customers , mr brown . i'm more than happy to help . for comprehensive credit granting , iba will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch . __eou__ how long a period will you look at to determine this ? __eou__ we will consider the first part of the year , in your particular field , and your credit rating can be no less than class a , during that period . __eou__ that sounds simple enough . it's friday today , i'll be back on monday morning , first thing , with all of the relevant data . see you then , and enjoy your weekend .

hello , sir . what can we do for you today ? __eou__ hello . i've been asked to come and see about something called l / c ? what is it exactly ? __eou__ l / c stands for ' letter of credit ' . this is necessary for trade between two countries . a letter of credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . __eou__ so the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street !
hello , sir . how can we help you today ? __eou__ i need to find out some more information for l / c . i would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please . __eou__ ok , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include insurance forms , way bills , bills of lading , customs forms , various certificates . __eou__ ok , got it . is there anything else i need to know before we go ahead ? __eou__ just that in effect , a basic letter of credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . __eou__ that sounds fine , thanks for that . let's go ahead !
hello . is everything ok , there ? __eou__ i'm having a little trouble with this form . __eou__ what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ there are two types of l / c here and i'm not sure which one i want . __eou__ that's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . we usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular . __eou__ so , i should choose that one ? __eou__ i would recommend it , yes . then you just need to complete that form . __eou__ i see . it's very nice of you to help me . is this form alright ? __eou__ yes , that's all in order . let's get this processed for you , then .
good afternoon . may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i'd like to make a deposit . __eou__ which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ? __eou__ i prefer time deposit . __eou__ okey . the interest rate for time deposit is higher . could you tell me it's rib deposit or currency deposit ? __eou__ rib deposit . __eou__ is it your first time to make a deposit here ? __eou__ yes . __eou__ the term of time deposit ranges from three months to five years , including three months , six months , one year , two years , three years and five years . how long would you like to keep your deposit ? __eou__ six months . __eou__ fill in this slip in ink , please . __eou__ here you are . __eou__ all right . just a moment , please . __eou__ thank you .
hello . what can i do for you today ? __eou__ i've got some documents here that go with the l / c our company opened 10 days ago . i think there is something wrong . __eou__ really ? have you checked everything carefully ? __eou__ very carefully , that's when i found the problem . __eou__ ah , i see . the goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? __eou__ yep , you've got it ! what should we do ? __eou__ usually , if the problem is insignificant i advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . but this does seem a little more serious . i suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . hopefully you can sort it out over the phone . __eou__ that's a great idea ; thanks for your help .
hello , welcome to lincoln bank . what can we do for you today ? __eou__ i want to effect payment under an l / c today . __eou__ no problem . ok ... just checking for you . ah , i'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . what you can do is buy some us dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount . __eou__ that seems alright . what's the exchange rate like today ? good or bad ? __eou__ it's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 .
hello , welcome to the international business counter , sir . what can we do for you today ? __eou__ hi . i need some help with these documents under l / c . __eou__ of course . is there a problem with them ? __eou__ yes . my manager sent me in , there's a problem with the shipping time . it's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it . __eou__ you will need to return the documents . that's no problem ; we can deal with that for you now . __eou__ thank you . i need to get this done as soon as possible ; my manager is tearing his hair out !
good afternoon . welcome to lincoln bank , how can we be of service ? __eou__ hi . you called and said i should come in . it's about some documents that have arrived for nobut foods . __eou__ just pulling up your information now . yes , some documents arrived for you from sapporo . __eou__ oh great ! we've been waiting for those . is everything alright with them ? __eou__ actually , there is a problem . it's the goods description , it's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes . __eou__ no , everything has to be perfect . __eou__ no problem , i'll just get the form for you .
hello again . what can i do for you today ? __eou__ yes , i'm back ! it's nice to see you again . i'm here about those documents . __eou__ ah yes , the ones from sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ? __eou__ that's right . i had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? __eou__ well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... __eou__ yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a discrepancy fee . __eou__ the customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a discrepancy fee of 100 us dollars . __eou__ that's wonderful news ! i'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . thank you for helping us to fix that little problem .
good morning , mr bell . how are you today ? are you here to sort out your l / c documents ? __eou__ yes . i've been through them and there's a problem , a rather major discrepancy actually . you see ? it should be kn509 . __eou__ i see , here it says km509 . __eou__ exactly , if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match . __eou__ yes , i see what you mean . you need to reject these documents .
welcome to iba . how can i help you ? __eou__ you called yesterday to tell me that our funds under the l / c had arrived ? it's ming cha legal services . __eou__ oh , yes . i remember . you must be mr xie . it's nice to put a face to a voice . __eou__ yes , it sure is . the l / c number is jd185649000023 . __eou__ jd185649000023 ? yes , found it . 175,000 euros , is that correct ? jd185649000023 ? __eou__ correct . could i convert that into rib ? __eou__ yes , you can . just wait a moment and i'll do that for you now . __eou__ that's fine , thanks .
good morning , sir . are you here to get some advice about our new personal financing program ? __eou__ i am indeed . what can you tell me ? __eou__ the account is a compound savings account , which is in rib and forex . __eou__ do i get a card ? __eou__ yes , you can have a money link card . you can also base the account on time deposits . the choice is yours . __eou__ how about the interest ? i'm not really happy with the interest i'm receiving through my current account . __eou__ the interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our personal financing . __eou__ that sounds better . also , can i use the one card for several accounts ? say , if i have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? __eou__ yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits . __eou__ that's wonderful .
hello , there . what can we do for you today ? __eou__ i received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . is that right ? __eou__ yes , that's right . we have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already . __eou__ i also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which i am , it's possible to get additional benefits ? __eou__ right again . we can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the stock exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments . __eou__ what if i don't want to come in to the branch , can i use the consultation service over the phone ? __eou__ certainly , sir . via phone or internet , any time , any place .
good afternoon , you look a little stuck . can i help ? __eou__ the thing is , i've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but i can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__ i see . what is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__ i'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a savings deposit . __eou__ well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__ i was thinking of around 10,000 rib . __eou__ that's a nice round figure to deal with ! ok , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 rib . __eou__ and for the savings deposit ? __eou__ for the savings deposit you could actually get more . you see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . so , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__ wow ! a third more ? very good .
good day . welcome to iba , what can i assist you with today ? __eou__ hello , yes , i'm a stock investor and i'm looking at opening a new account with you . perhaps your new compound savings one ? i already have a current account with you . __eou__ that's no trouble , sir . __eou__ i'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . it sounds just perfect for me , as i'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . __eou__ yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our personal financing program . __eou__ what i need to know is how i can keep track of what's going on . i mean , some days i buy and sell quite a lot . some days , there's no activity at all . __eou__ for every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both . __eou__ that's just what i need , sometimes i'm pretty forgetful .
hello , madam . what can we do for you today ? __eou__ hi . i've been sent over from turner interiors . they said i need to collect some sort of l / c ? do you have it ? __eou__ i certainly do . here it is , an export l / c from tokyo . __eou__ it should be from sayuri beds . is that right ? __eou__ yes , it is . sayuri beds , tokyo , japan . __eou__ that's what i want ! do you need me to sign anything ? or fill in some forms ? __eou__ just sign right here , please . that's everything you need to do . __eou__ perfect . thank you , goodbye !

good morning , may i help you ? __eou__ hello , i want to remit one thousand yuan to magnolia company . __eou__ please fill out this form , please . __eou__ ok ... do i put on magnolia company for the receiver ? __eou__ yes . you must put on its name and full address . __eou__ ok , i see . here you are . is that ok now ? __eou__ let me check . yes . your one thousand remittance , please . __eou__ here you are . what is the rate ? __eou__ this rate is one percent . that will be 10 yuan . __eou__ ok , when will this remittance arrive ? __eou__ generally it will arrive within a week . __eou__ that's good . is there anything else ? __eou__ no . that's all . you have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order . __eou__ thanks , i will .
could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? __eou__ well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . i'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . __eou__ i hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . __eou__ we check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . as new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . i'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . __eou__ well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . what's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__ i said by the middle of october . this is the best we can promise . __eou__ all right . i'll take you at your word . may i suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on october 15th or earlier ? our letter of credit will be opened early september . __eou__ good . let's call it a deal . we'll do our best to advance the shipment to september . the chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . but of course you cannot count on that . in any case , we'll let you know by email . __eou__ that's very considerate of you . and now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? __eou__ we generally insure w . p . ( w . p . a ) on a c . i . f . offer . special risks , such as tend ( theft , pilferage and non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . __eou__ i suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . __eou__ quite right . according to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . __eou__ then what about sicc ( strikes , riots and civil commotions ) ? can we request you to cover this for our imports ? __eou__ yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . however , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . __eou__ then please cover w . p . a . and tend for this transaction . __eou__ all right , i'll adjust the price accordingly .
is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? __eou__ well , i can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . __eou__ that might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . what about free delivery ? if we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? __eou__ yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . we would have to insist on the annual contract , however . i understand it's not the most convenient for you . perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . __eou__ that would be fine . we could accept a lower rebate .
mr . brown , i'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . i'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . __eou__ what is it , mrs . wang ? __eou__ it's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . they reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . to our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . we can't accept them in this state . they are unfit for human consumption . and the medical officer of health has issued a stop notice on them . __eou__ is that so ? so far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . we are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . have you any evidence ? __eou__ certainly . here's a survey report by a well-known lab in london , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . __eou__ though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . what's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . __eou__ the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . it is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . __eou__ as you know , before shipment , the commodity inspectionbureau inspected the goods in question . they concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . __eou__ i think the inspection bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . the part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . as the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , i think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . __eou__ the inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . we do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods f . o . b . houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . __eou__ we've already got in touch with the underwriter . but they have refused to accept any liability . they attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . __eou__ that's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . i'm afraid i have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . __eou__ to my regret , we failed to cover contamination . this is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . __eou__ otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . __eou__ well , live and learn . it seems we'll have to waive the claim .
good morning , sir . what can i do for you ? __eou__ yes , i'd like to change australian dollars for rib . __eou__ how much do you want to change ? __eou__ i am not sure . what's the rate today ? __eou__ it's 1 australian dollar to 6.1 yuan rib . __eou__ what was the rate yesterday ? __eou__ the rate was 1 australia dollar to 6.5 yuan yesterday . __eou__ oh , the rate goes down . __eou__ it does , sir . do you still want to have it changed now ? __eou__ let me think ... will the rate still go down tomorrow ? __eou__ i don't know , sir . but it won't change much . __eou__ well , i want to change 1000 australian dollars for rib . __eou__ okay . please sign here in this form . __eou__ ok . __eou__ here is the 6,100 rib . __eou__ thank you very much .
when it comes to select a fund , you will always read past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ? __eou__ maybe it is right since everything is possible . you know the market changes quickly these days . but i still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . for me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . i really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . __eou__ if you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . __eou__ i will think about it .
everyone wants to be financial lose kill . you must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . i ’ m thinking about buying stocks . it can be a good investment if i can manage well . what do you say ? __eou__ i partly agree with you . buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . anyway , people like us need help with investing . why not do some online research ? there are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . in addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . __eou__ wow , you sound very professional . __eou__ i just watched the investment tv program last weekend . it has become a very hot topic these days . actually i am not even a beginner .
i ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time i would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . please quote us c . i . f . rangoon . __eou__ please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . __eou__ i ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . __eou__ all right . here are our f . o . b . price lists . all the prices are subject to our final confirmation . __eou__ your price is reasonable but i wonder if you would give us a discount . you know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from european suppliers . __eou__ we usually offer on a net basis only . many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . __eou__ discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . __eou__ the quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . if you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . __eou__ as far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . and generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . i hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . __eou__ well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . __eou__ 1 % ? that ’ s too low a rate . could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__ i ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . __eou__ it seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . i ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . __eou__ all right . see you tomorrow .
i can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting quality . __eou__ i ’ ve looked at your units , and i am very happy with them . your goods are all far above standard quality . __eou__ we spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . we don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits . __eou__ well , we ’ re really interested in placing an order under negotiation . we can start the negotiations as soon as you want . __eou__ that ’ s great . i ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . i ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . __eou__ fine . also , would you mind if i asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? i may have a few more questions about your quality analysis .
i really like what you have . but the price for this product is much higher than we expected . i am absolutely not a buyer at that price . __eou__ i know it is not the cheapest on the market . but if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . this device is built in with the most advanced technology . every aspect has reached the international standard . it is a worthwhile investment . __eou__ i understand that . if you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . __eou__ well , the best i can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . that is our best offer . __eou__ err , well , i can ’ t decide right now . do you mind if i have a small internal discussion on this first ? i will tell you our decision this afternoon . __eou__ sure , no problem .
are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? __eou__ no . these terms need to be amplified . __eou__ what if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? __eou__ then the shipping documents have to be attached . that way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . __eou__ therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . __eou__ yes , that's very important .
i ’ ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . __eou__ we have the offer ready for you . let me see ... here it is . 100 cases houston bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , c . i . f european main ports , for shipment in june 2001 . the offer is valid for five days . __eou__ why , your price has soared . it ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . it would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . __eou__ i ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . you know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . the price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . __eou__ i ’ m afraid i can ’ t agree with you there . i must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ ve received from other sources . __eou__ but you must take the quality into consideration . everyone in the trade knows that us ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . __eou__ i agree that yours are of better quality . but there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . you can ’ t very well ignore that . prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . __eou__ there ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . that ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . to be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . __eou__ well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . but i ’ ll have to try , i suppose .
i wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . it's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers . __eou__ as a rule , we don't allow any discount . __eou__ but we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . __eou__ that's true . but i am sorry i can't make an exception . we have quoted you our lowest price . we can't give you any more discounts .
i hope we could offer the most favorable terms . __eou__ i am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . here is our offer . all the prices on the list are firm . if your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . __eou__ good . is there any commission included ? we are commission agents . __eou__ as a rule , we don't allow any commission . however , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission . __eou__ ok . how about the earliest possible shipment ? __eou__ by the coming september . __eou__ could you make an offer on fob basis ? __eou__ certainly !
shall we discuss the packing ? you know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . i'd like to see the sample of packing . __eou__ we have made a lot of improvement in packing . you are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . i think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . __eou__ quite good . the beautiful design and bright color are just the european taste . how are you gonna pack these blouses ? __eou__ we are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . you'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ wonderful .
mr . black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? __eou__ in april or early may . __eou__ i am afraid shipment by early may would be too late for us . our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . the fertilizers must be delivered before april , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . __eou__ in that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . now is jan . if the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of march , only 2 months are left . the time is too limited . __eou__ you understand a timely delivery is very important to us . __eou__ all right . you can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . the fertilizers will be delivered before april .
we are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet . __eou__ how much would you like ? __eou__ 10,000 sq . m . you should give us a discount for such a large quantity . __eou__ a higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . __eou__ the iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . no doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . __eou__ of course i know . but there is too high a rate . frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % .
we'd better cover the porcelain ware against all risks . __eou__ all right . our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . __eou__ i'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . __eou__ ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . __eou__ that's understood .
i am afraid i have some bad news for you . it's about our order contract o5tswal . __eou__ what's the problem ? __eou__ the goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . what's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . __eou__ really ? that's something unexpected . you see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . the goods were in perfect condition when they left . __eou__ but then there were some cracks in a number of cases . almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . __eou__ that could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . __eou__ but our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . __eou__ but there is nothing wrong with our packing . our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . __eou__ but you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . when they were rehandled , some of them were broken . __eou__ i don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care .
what's your main range ? __eou__ generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . we can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . here are the catalogues and the pattern books . they will give you a rough idea about our products . __eou__ i am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . i think some of these items will find a ready market in canada . but what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . __eou__ to be reliable is the strong point of our products . as a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . __eou__ then i'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .
i am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? __eou__ i am afraid not . we usually design the label ourselves . you know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__ in that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__ what are they ? __eou__ first , the languages on the label should be in both english and french . second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__ that can be easily done . is there anything else ? __eou__ the brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__ we'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__ thanks for your help .
welcome to china , mr . white . __eou__ how do you do , ms . chi ? __eou__ welcome to this corporation , mr . white . won ’ t you please sit down ? __eou__ thank you . __eou__ our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the oct . exhibition there . now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . __eou__ yes , we have . i ’ ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . here is a copy of it . __eou__ good . well , mr . white , most of the items listed are available this year . i hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . __eou__ i hope so , too . now i'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . __eou__ here are our catalog and price list . the catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . __eou__ thank you , ms chi . what are your normal export terms ? __eou__ we normally export cfr . __eou__ what commission do you usually pay for your exports ? as you know , we import on commission basis . __eou__ that can be discussed . __eou__ all right . when can we meet again for more specific details , ms chi ? __eou__ what about tomorrow morning at 9 ? i'll come over to your hotel . __eou__ i'll be expecting you , then .
what arrangement will you make about payment ? __eou__ we shall open an irrevocable l / c to cover our shipment from shanghai to hamburg . is it at sight or after sight ? __eou__ at sight of course . __eou__ some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . __eou__ i am afraid that can't be done . we have never done business on such terms . __eou__ but such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . other suppliers are offering better terms . some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__ we ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . you don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . the usual percentage is around 85 . __eou__ that's true . i'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . __eou__ yes . we usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__ if you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . __eou__ thank you . i am glad we have come to an agreement at last .
if i remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ . __eou__ that's right . let's go into the details . __eou__ ok . i hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of sep . we'd like them to be there in time for our christmas sales . __eou__ christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ? __eou__ but in the united states the christmas season begins about a month before dec . 25 . __eou__ well . i am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . __eou__ i hope you'll try to get them to step up production . __eou__ as new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . __eou__ if that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . __eou__ i am sorry . __eou__ what's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__ i said by the middle of oct . this is the best we can promise . __eou__ all right . i'll take you at your word . __eou__ good . let's call it a deal . we will do our best to advance the shipment , but your l / c should be opened early sep . __eou__ i promise .
the order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . if shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers . __eou__ i am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . the manufacturers are fully committed . they have no stock on hand . __eou__ can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? __eou__ how's this then ? we propose partial shipment . we can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready . __eou__ sounds like a good idea . __eou__ we propose to deliver 50 % in june and the balance in aug . __eou__ i agree with your proposal .
i've come about your wools . according to our market survey , wools are likely to find a ready market in our country . __eou__ wonderful ! we can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you . here it is . the unit price is usd 15.00 per kilogram . __eou__ do you quote cif or fob ? __eou__ it's fob shanghai . __eou__ could you quote the price of cif hamburg ? __eou__ certainly , that's easy . we will work out our cif offer this evening . could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 am ? __eou__ okay , see you tomorrow !
well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . what mode of payment do you wish to employ ? __eou__ irrevocable letter of credit , of course . it's the normal terms of payment in international business . __eou__ could you adopt d / a or d / p ? you see i have to pay a deposit when i open a letter of credit . that will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . __eou__ you might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__ anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . we've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . it would help me greatly , if you could accept d / a or d / p . it makes no difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__ well . as you understand , the irrevocable l / c gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . we always ask for l / c for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by l / c for our imports . we only accept l / c for regular orders .
what kind of document is an invoice ? __eou__ it's a document from the seller to the buyer . it contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . __eou__ how many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? __eou__ four . they are loco invoice , fob invoice , cif invoice and franco invoice . __eou__ what does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? __eou__ by loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . by fob invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . by cif invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . the price in franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . __eou__ oh , i see .
hey , daughter . let me ask you something . __eou__ yes , dad ? __eou__ do you have life insurance ? __eou__ well , no . it just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . __eou__ you have children now . what if something , god forbid , happens to you ? __eou__ that's true . well , how much do you think i should get ? __eou__ a 10,000 dollar policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . here , call my agent . he will give you a good deal .
how are your stocks doing , jim ? __eou__ oh , all right . i lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . __eou__ yeah , i lost money investing in the internet too . __eou__ just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas . __eou__ i changed my strategy around too . i invest in good companies now . __eou__ yeah , me too . did you hear about ted ? __eou__ no . what happened ? __eou__ he lost his kids ’ college money by trading . __eou__ oh , boy . his wife can't be happy about that .
the city bank . may i help you , sir ? __eou__ yes , i'd like to close my account . __eou__ may i have your name , please ? __eou__ adam smith . __eou__ alright , what's your address ? __eou__ 56 edison ave , apartment 39 , los angeles . __eou__ when would you like your account closed ? __eou__ next friday . __eou__ okay . where would you like to have your last bill sent to you ? __eou__ 14 may flower ave , los angeles . __eou__ alright , we'll take care of that .
our afghan customers wanna buy china's tea . i am thinking of placing an order with you . __eou__ which tea do you prefer , black or jasmine tea ? __eou__ i like both . could you show me some samples ? __eou__ of course , here you are . these are black tea from anti , oolong tea from guangdong , oolong tea from fujisan and longing tea from xinu . the new products are curls black tea , crushed black tea and so on . they are the best sellers in many countries . __eou__ oh , such a variety . all of them are excellent both in color and flavour . no wonder our people like china ’ s tea better than any other kind . could you give me some idea of the prices ? __eou__ here is our price list . all the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . you can see the prices are reasonable . __eou__ i'd like you to quote me cif karachi . __eou__ right . could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? __eou__ yes . i want 500 kilograms of black tea from anti , 200 kilograms of jasmine tea from hangzhou and 100 kilograms of crushed black tea , first grade . __eou__ good . we will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . is that all right ? __eou__ yes . see you tomorrow afternoon .
good morning , madam . can i help you ? __eou__ yes , i ’ ve come to inquire about a 6,000- dollar remittance from california . has it arrived ? __eou__ may i have your name , please ? __eou__ my name is jenny clinton . __eou__ i see . wait for a moment please . i am sorry , mrs . clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . __eou__ really ? it should have arrived . it was sent a week ago . __eou__ if the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . but if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . __eou__ well , then i'll come again the day after tomorrow . __eou__ or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? __eou__ that would be very kind of you . __eou__ could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? __eou__ the phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . __eou__ thank you . we'll inform you in time . goodbye .
hello ! how can i help you , sir ? __eou__ i want to take out a loan for school . what kind of interest rate do you offer ? __eou__ do you qualify for any of the federal loan programs ? __eou__ yes , but i need to borrow some more money . __eou__ well . in that case we can offer you a private educational loan . __eou__ what's the interest rate ? __eou__ it's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan . __eou__ how do i go about taking it out ? __eou__ just fill out this application . we can let you know right away if you qualify . __eou__ all right , thank you !
good afternoon , miss . what can i do for you ? __eou__ could you tell me my account balance ? my account number is ... __eou__ just a moment , please . your name ? __eou__ emily smith . __eou__ here is your balance . __eou__ thank you . i want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars . __eou__ here you go , miss . __eou__ thank you .
i'd like to apply for a credit card . can you help me with my application ? __eou__ i'd be glad to . __eou__ i'm afraid that i don't have a credit history . i just came to this country . __eou__ do you have an account with this bank ? __eou__ i'm afraid not . __eou__ in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . that would help with your credit card application . __eou__ what is the interest rate on your card ? __eou__ the annual charge rate is 9.5 % . __eou__ that's very expensive ! __eou__ not really . the credit card is a revolving account . you only pay interest on what you owe . __eou__ how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? __eou__ you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . __eou__ does the card provide any other benefits ? __eou__ you can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card .
hello , may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i need some more cash for my visit in china . may i cash a traveler ’ s check here ? __eou__ of course . we would be happy to cash it for you . __eou__ i was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . __eou__ well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . you see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . __eou__ you mean there is really not that much of a difference . __eou__ no , madam . not very much . __eou__ well , may i cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? i think that will be enough . __eou__ yes , i'll be happy to cash these for you . would you please countersign them here ? __eou__ ok .
put on the helmet , please . __eou__ do we need to put on the jackets too ? __eou__ you ’ d better , to protect your clothes . now please watch your step . __eou__ thank you . is the production line fully automated ? __eou__ well , not fully automated . __eou__ i see . how do you control the quality ? __eou__ all products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . __eou__ what ’ s the monthly output ? __eou__ one thousand units per month now . but we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with october . __eou__ what ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? __eou__ about 2 % in normal operations . __eou__ that ’ s wonderful . is that where the finished products come off ? __eou__ yes . shall we take a break now ?
how large is the plant ? __eou__ it covers an area of 75,000 square meters . __eou__ it ’ s much larger than i expected . when was the plant set up ? __eou__ in the early 70s . we ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . __eou__ congratulations ! __eou__ thank you . __eou__ how many employees do you have in this plant ? __eou__ 500 . we ’ re running on three shifts . __eou__ does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? __eou__ our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . well , here we ’ re at the production shop . shall we start with the assembly line ? __eou__ that ’ s fine .
it was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . it gave me a good idea of your product range . __eou__ it ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . what ’ s your general impression , may i ask ? __eou__ very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your nw model . __eou__ that ’ s our latest development . a product with high performance . we put it on the market just two months ago . __eou__ the machine gives you an edge over your competitors , i guess . __eou__ certainly . no one can match us as far as speed is concerned . __eou__ could you give me some brochures for that machine ? and the price if possible . __eou__ right . here is our sales catalog and literature . __eou__ thank you . i think we may be able to work together in the future .
i'm pleased to meet you again , mrs . king . __eou__ pleased to see you , too , mr . brown . __eou__ you've had a good trip , i hope . __eou__ yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__ it's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__ so it is , i've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__ we shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . you've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__ i'm glad you're satisfied with our work . i can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__ yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . we can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__ thank you . __eou__ but i think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in canada is rather conservative . after all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . you can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__ that is the result of our hard work . well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__ 500 pieces . __eou__ no , no . that's too big a number to be acceptable . let's put it at 450 pieces . and we'll strive to sell more , of course . we wish to add another clause . for every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__ all right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . and for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__ i suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__ we would like to make a specific mention of one more point . as our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ no , certainly not . that's a reasonable restriction . __eou__ another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__ yes , we've already prepared one . i've brought it with me . i'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__ good , that's all then . __eou__ good .
i think you know already that i want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . __eou__ yes , mr . bergeron . you mentioned that in your letter . to tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . __eou__ is that so ? anyhow i want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . our firm specializes in this line of business . we have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the european market . __eou__ do you sell direct to shops ? __eou__ yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . we have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . __eou__ do you keep a stock of these things ? __eou__ in some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in london and act as distributors as well as agents . generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . we are paid for our service , of course . __eou__ that is , your commission . __eou__ yes , our commission is very reasonable . we usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . __eou__ the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and tv programs . a 10 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ according to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? __eou__ we will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . __eou__ we appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . but our suggestion to you , mr . bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... __eou__ do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? __eou__ mr . bergeron , you leave us no alternative . we can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole european market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . besides our price is worked out according to the costing . a 10 % commission means an increase in our price . we must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . __eou__ oh , that's just too bad . i intended to make great efforts in selling your products . __eou__ well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . to start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . __eou__ ah , mrs . miller , but in this case am i covered ? __eou__ oh , yes . we will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . __eou__ all right , but i'll be back again for the autumn fair . and then i hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . __eou__ very good . we will discuss the matter again at the next fair .
this is our rock - bottom price , mr . li . we can't make any further concessions . __eou__ if that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__ what i mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great . __eou__ i think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . how about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? __eou__ what is your proposal ? __eou__ your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way , i meant it literally . __eou__ do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that's impossible . __eou__ what would you suggest ? __eou__ the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that'll definitely be rock bottom . __eou__ that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . __eou__ you certainly have a way of talking me into it . all right , let's meet half way again . __eou__ i'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . we'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . __eou__ yes , there's one other point i wish to clear up . __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ my friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the u . s . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . __eou__ yes , they're right . in fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . __eou__ i'm glad to hear that . with a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in washing - ton d . c . ? __eou__ basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in washington d . c . of course , there are more details to be attended to . we cannot settle it in a few words . __eou__ yes , of course . i'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . when do we meet again ? __eou__ how about tomorrow morning at 9 ? __eou__ good . i'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically .
first of all , i would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . i hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us . __eou__ we've been looking forward to your visit . it is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . it is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . __eou__ i would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . the styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . __eou__ we've received some similar comments from other australian firms too . __eou__ i understand you are selling the same products to some other australian importers . this tends to complicate my business . as you know , i am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . i have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . one of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . as it is to our mutual interests and profit , i am sure you'll have no objection to it . __eou__ we appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . as you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . however , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . __eou__ i'll come to that . my proposal is __eou__ as far as i remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? __eou__ well , i admit i always do business on the safe side . could you let me have your proposal then ? __eou__ let's put it this way . i propose a sole agency agreement for ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . __eou__ you certainly drive a hard bargain , mrs . brown . __eou__ on the contrary , mr . london , we value your friendship more than anything else . we both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . and with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . i'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . __eou__ well , if you put it this way , i'll have to comply . when shall we sign the contract , mrs . brown ? __eou__ tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ tomorrow afternoon will be fine .
how much do you pay wholesale for your products ? __eou__ we have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . but the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . __eou__ that must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? after all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . how much do they go for retail ? __eou__ retail price is 29.95 per unit . we take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . __eou__ is that including tax ? __eou__ no , that's the price before tax . the tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . __eou__ how much is your profit margin then ? __eou__ our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % .
i have here our price sheet on a f . o . b . basis . the prices are given without engagement . __eou__ good , if you ’ ll excuse me , i ’ ll go over the sheet right now . __eou__ take your time . __eou__ i can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . __eou__ i ’ m surprised to hear you say so . you know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . __eou__ we only ask that your prices be comparable to others . that ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . but first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . __eou__ the size of our order depends greatly on the prices . let ’ s settle that matter first . __eou__ well , as i ’ ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . __eou__ when i say your prices are much too high , i don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . __eou__ how much do you mean then ? can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . __eou__ impossible . how can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? __eou__ i think you are as well - informed as i am about the market for chemical fertilizers . it ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . may i suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? __eou__ very well , i will .
mrs . wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? __eou__ as i said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . we hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . __eou__ just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . i hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . __eou__ so do we . certainly it's a step forward on your side . but the gap is still too wide . __eou__ the ball is in your court , mrs.wang . what price would you suggest ? __eou__ to make your offer workable , i think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . __eou__ that won't do . you see , our profit margin is very narrow . it simply can't stand such a big cut . __eou__ i hate to disappoint you , mr . brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . do think it over , please . we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . __eou__ well , i'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . would you mind waiting a day or two , until i get a reply from the home office ? __eou__ not at all . shall we meet again , say , on friday morning ? __eou__ good . friday morning at 9 .
may i help you ? __eou__ yes , i would like to exchange some money . __eou__ what currency would you like to trade in ? __eou__ i would like to exchange chinese rib for american dollars . do you accept $ 100 bills ? __eou__ no problem , we can accept any denomination . how much would you like to exchange today ? __eou__ well , that depends on the rate . how much is the rib trading at today ? __eou__ it's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . the american dollar is now worth 7.45rmb.if you would like to sell rib , we can give you a rate of 7.35.will that be all right ? __eou__ i guess , here , give me 5,000 rib worth . i might as well exchange a little extra . who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
so how did i do ? __eou__ not too good , i'm sorry . __eou__ i lost ? __eou__ it was close.to be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.acme promised them almost a full month sooner . __eou__ so the price was good ? __eou__ yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . they just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.if something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for christmas.if you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . __eou__ so i didn't miss by much then . __eou__ no.it was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . better luck next time . __eou__ i knew the delivery was slow but i figured the price would win it for me . __eou__ that's possible , bill.but the price would have to have been a lot lower , like around fifty cents per unit .
how much will our order from your factory be ? __eou__ i'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . __eou__ i'm afraid i can't wait that long . can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? __eou__ well , i would need an idea of how large your order would be . about how many units would you need ? __eou__ just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . __eou__ please give me a few minute to calculate ... our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . is that price acceptable to you ? __eou__ your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . __eou__ would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out .
is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? __eou__ we did the best that we could to give you a low price . did you get our recent estimate ? __eou__ based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.with the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.can ' t you do any better ? __eou__ i've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . if i go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . i really want to work with you on this . but we've already gone as low as we can go . __eou__ i'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.that is our bottom line . if you can meet that price , you've got the deal.otherwise ... __eou__ i'll tell you what , i'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what i can do . i can't give you any guarantees . but we can try .
you got our email with all the specifications for the project . we'll be accepting bids untill noon on tuesday . if you have any questions between now and then , please let me know . __eou__ actually , i did have a question . we'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . we are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . but at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too . __eou__ i understand . but unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . you can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . we also consider other elements , including design and practicality . we also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company . __eou__ do you have any price range ? is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? __eou__ we're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . that's all i can say .
donna ! how are you ? it's good to hear your voice . __eou__ thank you . jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__ so how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? __eou__ great ! and , how are things in your neck of the woods ? __eou__ things are so great here . i almost smiled myself to death last week . one of my coworkers had to give me cpr . __eou__ oh.jack , i have missed your sense of humor.ha ha ha ! nobody else sees things quite like you do.it ' s your gift . __eou__ or a curse . __eou__ nope , it's a gift.anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time . __eou__ that , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . __eou__ are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? __eou__ heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , i'll let you have'em at 50 off . __eou__ you silver-tongued devil . can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? __eou__ i could , but where's the fun in that ?
hello , come in , i've been waiting for you . __eou__ than you , i'm not late , am i ? __eou__ no , no , no , not at all.it ' s just that i've been looking forward to meeting you . __eou__ well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . i've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . __eou__ ha , ha , ha ! yes , i guess i deserved that . let me explain , okay ? __eou__ please , i wish you would . __eou__ well , as you probably know i buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . __eou__ yes , i know that . it's why ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . i hear you're a good man to do business with . __eou__ i'm very old-fashioned . i believe in loyalty.once i start a sales relationship with someone , i stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . i expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.but if i find out they screwed me over , then i find another supplier . __eou__ that's pretty much what i heard . __eou__ well , those are my terms . as long as you honor them , we do business.if you break faith and try to take advantage , i'll find someone else to work with . can you live with that ? __eou__ no problem at all , mike . just give me the chance .
sandrawu chunk international . __eou__ hello , miss wu , this is dan robson calling from otc limited . i'd like to check my last order . when exactly was it sent out ? __eou__ i can check that for you right now . would you mind holding ? __eou__ sure . no problem . __eou__ mr . robson , i'm sorry . our computer system is down . could i call you back later ? __eou__ sure . do you have my number ? __eou__ yes , i have it right here . i'm so sorry about this . __eou__ no problem . i'll wait for your call .
good morning , welcome to bank of the usa . how may i help you today ? __eou__ hi , i need to transfer some money to another account . it ’ s urgent . __eou__ okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? __eou__ no . i ’ ve never made a transfer before . __eou__ it ’ s alright , i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__ a company account . i need to pay a bill . __eou__ okay , i ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . __eou__ i have all the information in this folder . __eou__ well . you ’ ve come prepared . i have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . __eou__ oh , that ’ s such a relief . i didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much . __eou__ it ’ s my pleasure .
i ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , mr . johnson . i can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! __eou__ no problem , if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . __eou__ well , as you know , i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon-bons here in the united states . they ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . __eou__ mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? belgium ? __eou__ actually , the factory is located in scotland . __eou__ really ? i didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production __eou__ that ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they ’ ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here , i brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__ oh , thanks . mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__ unique , aren ’ t they ? i bet you ’ ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__ yes , very interesting flavors ... slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ? __eou__ i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i ’ m sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and haggis . __eou__ haggis ? what ’ s haggis ? __eou__ it ’ s a traditional scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . __eou__ ah , get back to you . __eou__ mr . johnson ? mr . johnson ?
we've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . the client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . we've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? __eou__ oh ... um ... i don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . plus i'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . that's not going to come cheap . __eou__ but it would only be adding to the existing structure . we're not talking about anything new here ... __eou__ it doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . it'll cost you a pretty penny ... __eou__ how much do you think it would cost ? __eou__ mumm , i estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . __eou__ $ 500per light ? ! that's ridiculous ! it can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__ it is , i'll tell you why . we'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5pm , and it will probably take him an hour a light . plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . __eou__ can't you give me a break on this ? we've already spent so much money on lighting , i hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . __eou__ no , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . we can't go in the hole with this . i am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it .
we agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . good news is , i talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . __eou__ great ! i'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... __eou__ now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . that shouldn't be a problem , right ? __eou__ no ... we shouldn't have any problem with that . i know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . __eou__ so , if all this is agreeable to you , i'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . if you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on tuesday . __eou__ great !
i really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . i've thought through a lot of these details , and i hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . __eou__ let's get start . what kinds of things do you have in mind ? if you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . __eou__ firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . if you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . __eou__ huh ... i think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . how about this ? we'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . __eou__ well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . __eou__ no , you have to take care of the insurance . but we are willing to pay the half transport . can you accept that ? __eou__ we cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . __eou__ but you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and i'll tell you what ... i'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . __eou__ done ...
good afternoon miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? you know , you can never get enough . __eou__ i think my husband has some . __eou__ are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? if something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . __eou__ that ’ s true . if something happened to my husband , i might lose everything . both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . i can ’ t afford that by myself . __eou__ could we sit and look at the policy i mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? __eou__ certainly .
that was a beautiful car . it ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled . __eou__ well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . so you don ’ t need to worry . __eou__ i don ’ t think i could afford that kind of car again . i think i ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . __eou__ since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . __eou__ what will happen if i chose a smaller car ? would the payments be the same ? __eou__ if you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . would you still want full coverage ? __eou__ yes .
excuse me may i know the name of your corporation ? __eou__ china national textiles import and export corporation __eou__ we found your samples very attractive.we ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable __eou__ our products are of good quality.since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.if you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent __eou__ can i have a reduction of seven percent ? __eou__ it depends on how much you order __eou__ can i use the fas terms ? __eou__ i'd rather use the cif terms.you ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract .
do you think i should turn down his offer ? __eou__ yes , it's the correct thing to do . __eou__ but we may not get another partner . __eou__ even so , we can't do business with him.he ' s not reliable .
what happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? how do i handle that ? __eou__ well , these things happens , i know that . you just have to stay straight with me . __eou__ right ! so how do i do that ? what will make you happy ? __eou__ well , i suggest you just keep me posted.that should do it.that way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . __eou__ excuse me ? __eou__ yeah , it really is that simple.every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . that's all you need to do . __eou__ what kind of change , just in prices ? __eou__ no , any change . i want you to keep me as informed as you are . i need to know as much as you do . if you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . __eou__ you mean on product availability , reliability and price ? __eou__ no , everthing.those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.so i can make a fully informed decision . __eou__ so it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . i can do that , provided the company i'm working for isn't hurt . __eou__ i think we'll get along fine .
well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . now what about the terms of payment ? __eou__ we only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__ i see . could you make an exception and accept d / a or d / p ? __eou__ i'm afraid not . we insist on a letter of credit . __eou__ to tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . when i open a letter of credit with a bank , i have to pay a deposit . that'll tie up my money and increase my cost . __eou__ consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__ still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . it would help me greatly if you would accept d / a or d / p . you can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . it makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__ well , mrs . wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . we always require l / c for our exports . and the other way round , we pay by l / c for our imports . __eou__ to meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by l / c and the balance by d / p ? __eou__ i'm very sorry , mrs . wang . but i'm afraid i can't promise you even that . as i've said , we require payment by l / c .
hi , bill . it's marsha black at mppd ltd . how are you ? __eou__ hello , marsha , i haven't heard from you in a long time . i'm great , and you ? __eou__ not too bad at all . do you have a minute ? __eou__ sure , what can i do for you ? __eou__ we're getting ready to place our christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.you know , so we can have the funds put aside . __eou__ i'm really busy right now . i got a lot on my plate.so this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? __eou__ right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . __eou__ well , i can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? or do you need them in writing ? __eou__ it's going to be shown to the board so i need it in writing.make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . how soon can i have it ? __eou__ is this another rush , dear ? did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? __eou__ yeah , i'm afraid so . i really need your help here . __eou__ well , just because it's you . tomorrow , say around noon .
mrs . miller , you are an old friend of ours . in order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . will that satisfy you ? __eou__ that's great . thank you for making this concession . i accept . __eou__ now i repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each c . i . f . los angeles . __eou__ good . now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . __eou__ as to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ carton ? __eou__ yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ why use wooden cases ? __eou__ i'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . __eou__ cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . they'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . __eou__ all right . carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . __eou__ you needn't worry about that . cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am i right ? __eou__ that's right . as soon as i get home , i'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . __eou__ please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . another thing , the l / c should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . __eou__ no problem . that can be done . i understand you'll ship the goods before the end of may ? __eou__ right . we'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by houston commodities inspection bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . __eou__ yes , we agreed to that . we have great confidence in your inspection institution . through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . __eou__ thank you . you can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . however , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . __eou__ exactly . that's what we have done in the past . __eou__ well , it seems we have covered everything . we'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . __eou__ can you speed it up and let me have it today ? i'm leaving tomorrow . i've been here for almost a month now , you see . my corporation is urging me to return . i've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . __eou__ let me see . if we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . __eou__ that's fine too .
well , mr . brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? __eou__ many of our business friends in england , france , switzerland , italy and germany are paying for our exports in japan currency . it is quite easy to do so . __eou__ i know some of them are doing that . but this is new to me . i've never made payment in yen before . it is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but i may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . __eou__ many banks in europe now carry accounts in yen . they are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . __eou__ do you mean to say that i can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in london or bonn ? __eou__ sure you can . several of the banks in london , such as the national westminster bank and barclays bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . they'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . __eou__ i see .
to get around your difficulty , mr . brown , i'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . you can send in an addi trional order later . __eou__ well , i'll consider the possibility . by the way , when do i open the l / c if i want the goods to be delivered in june ? __eou__ a month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . __eou__ could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? __eou__ getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . you cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . __eou__ very well , mrs.wang . i'll not reduce my order . i'll take the full quantity you offer . and i'll arrange for the letter of credit to be opened in your favor as soon as i get home . __eou__ when will that be ? __eou__ early next week . in the meantime , i should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . i hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my letter of credit . __eou__ you can rest assured of that . we'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your l / c . __eou__ that'll be fine . i appreciate your cooperation . __eou__ very good . well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . i sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . __eou__ by the way , mrs . wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on japanese arts and crafts in our market . would you entertain this proposal ? __eou__ well , this is something new . a few of our friends from europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . we think there are a lot of details to go into . __eou__ if you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . __eou__ naturally , i appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of japanese arts and crafts . but i'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . i must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . __eou__ all right . anyway , i'll be staying here for another two weeks . but i'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . __eou__ we'll talk about it next time . now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change .
hi , mr . brown , we have visited the factories and i'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . __eou__ yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . all their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . __eou__ that's very good . but i have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . i just want to know the details about that . __eou__ ok , i'll show you how the packing is like . we have a showroom on the ground floor . let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__ sure . __eou__ these are the various kinds of packing for pliers . normally , we have three types of packing __eou__ oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__ the skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . it catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__ good , what about the export packing ? __eou__ well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__ is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? you see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . it's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__ you can rest assured of that . so far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__ i'm glad to hear that . by the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__ yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__ very good . ok , mr . brown , i'm now totally satisfied with your packing . you can execute our first order now , and i will open the l / c immediately after i return to taipei . __eou__ all right . we'll make the shipment as soon as your l / c is on hand .
that price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . __eou__ yes , i noticed that . to what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? __eou__ 20-30 % . but we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . that is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . __eou__ yes , of course . assembly would be quite a simple matter . cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . __eou__ sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . __eou__ yes , i've noticed that . where have you been placing them ? __eou__ all in the local market . one or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . __eou__ yes . what were they ? anything that will help sales ? __eou__ perhaps . general opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . __eou__ that's to keep the price down , i suppose . i'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . __eou__ thanks .
i wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__ i should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__ the federal food and drug administration , or the fda as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the united states . over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__ in my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__ ah , there's something in what you're saying . according to the present fda regulations , the ma ling labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the united states . __eou__ why not ? our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the ma ling label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . is it quite impossible for you to use the ma ling labels as they are ? __eou__ i'd be quite willing to if i could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the customs . __eou__ in that case , what can we do to help you ? have you any suggestions ? __eou__ would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a c . i . f . basis for delivery in hong kong ? our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the fda regulations . __eou__ do you think that's the only way out ? you know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products .
mr . jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? __eou__ very well . you know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . as to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . __eou__ good . a wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . with competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . __eou__ right you are . we'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ what about the outer packing ? __eou__ we'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ cartons ? __eou__ yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ why use wooden cases ? __eou__ i'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . __eou__ the cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . they won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . the stevedores will see to that . besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . silk blouses are not fragile goods . they can stand a lot of jolting . __eou__ maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at hamburg or london . if the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . this would make the blouses spotted or ruined . __eou__ no need to worry about that . the cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . __eou__ well , i don't want to take any chances . besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . __eou__ tampering with cartons is easily detected . i should say that this rather discourages pilferage . __eou__ maybe so , but i'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . __eou__ but cartons are quite seaworthy . they are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . there are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for w . p . a . and t . p . n . d . __eou__ if you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . __eou__ i'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . we'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . __eou__ i can understand your position . perhaps i'm asking too much . __eou__ we'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . __eou__ well , i'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . __eou__ please do . i'll be waiting for your reply .
now we have settled the terms of payment . is it possible to effect shipment during september ? __eou__ i don't think we can . __eou__ then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? __eou__ by the middle of october , i think . __eou__ that's too late . you see , november is the season for this commodity in our market , and our customs formalities are rather complicated . __eou__ i understand . __eou__ besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . the goods must therefore be shipped before october ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . __eou__ but our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . in fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . __eou__ mr . brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . if we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . __eou__ i see your point . however , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . i am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . __eou__ that's too bad , but i sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . __eou__ you may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . but the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . __eou__ but can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? make a special effort , please . a timely delivery means a lot to us . __eou__ all right . we'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say .
well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__ for sure ! i didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ? __eou__ yeah , i know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a 401k , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__ that ’ s interesting and logical i guess . in my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__ that seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__ yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__ i ’ ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money !
it has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . __eou__ and that is ? __eou__ how about making hong kong the port of shipment instead of new york ? __eou__ i'm afraid we can't agree to that . we concluded the business with you here in houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in new york . we wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from new york or seattle . hong kong is out of the question . __eou__ it's like this . there are only one or two ships sailing a month from new york to osaka , while sailings from hong kong are quite frequent . if shipment were effected from hong kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . __eou__ i see . you want to have your goods shipped from new york to osaka via hong kong , where they can be transshipped . is that the idea ? __eou__ yes , exactly , because i want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . __eou__ your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at hong kong . how about shipping them from seattle instead of network ? you may choose either one as port of shipment . it makes no difference to us . there are more sailings from seattle than from new york . __eou__ it sounds all right to me , but i will have to think about it . i'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . if i choose seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of march ? __eou__ we'll try our best . anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of april .
hello , sir , may i help you ? __eou__ yes . i would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will i have to pay each month ? __eou__ it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ it sounds good but , there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score . __eou__ that is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ you know what ? i don ’ t really need the money . thanks anyways !
good morning . i ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . __eou__ of course . please sit down . how can i help you ? __eou__ i bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . __eou__ i see . here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . we ’ ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . may i ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? these are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . __eou__ i understand . i live in the oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . __eou__ let me just check that on my computer . oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . the other thing to take into account is deductibles . __eou__ in this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? __eou__ it means that the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . the insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . __eou__ oh , i see . that ’ s fine . what is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? __eou__ if you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . __eou__ it seems that i should do some calculations before deciding . i presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . __eou__ we initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . these are renewable after the first year . __eou__ if i have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? i ’ ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . __eou__ that is of great concern to out clients . we aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that

which services offered by your band do you use most ? __eou__ i use several services . of course , i deposit and withdraw money quite often . i often use my atm card to take money out of my current account . i use my bank to exchange money form once currency t __eou__ do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? they are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ i sometimes use traveller's cheques , but sometimes i travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? i use direct debit . __eou__ yes , i do . it saves me a lot of time . i also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ that ’ s good idea . you don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . i suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ yes . my bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . there ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ i have a deposit account with my bank . there are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ i don ’ t have one . i prefer to buy shares . my bank also provides a share trading service . it ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ that ’ s great . but i prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain .

so , jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? __eou__ it ’ s great , dad . i don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . __eou__ even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . __eou__ i ’ ve never had a bank account before . why don ’ t i just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? __eou__ you know you would spend it . and also , money in the bank earns interest . __eou__ but what if i need my money suddenly ? __eou__ the bank will give you a pin , and you can withdraw money from any atm . __eou__ great ! so it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! __eou__ not quite . you have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . and sometimes the bank has service charges . but you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . let ’ s go make your first depot __eou__ ok . guess i have to do that before . i can make money my first withdrawal .

hey honey , how was your day ? __eou__ it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while.he ’ s in a bit of a jam . __eou__ why ? what happened ? __eou__ well , his son had an accident and bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . this really got me thinking , and i wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different hmo ’ s . __eou__ yeah , you ’ re right . we aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . __eou__ exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . the deductibles are low , too . __eou__ sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . __eou__ well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . __eou__ i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . __eou__ not in a million years !
hey , john ! i haven ’ t seen you in ages ! what ’ s new ? what have you been up to ? __eou__ pete ! nice to see you well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , i ’ ve actually gotten into doing some trading . __eou__ trading ? you , big guy ? what are you trading ? __eou__ currencies . __eou__ currencies ? as in euros , dollars , pounds and rupees ? __eou__ it ’ s called forex . foreign exchange . the great thing about it is that i don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . i put in a margin deposit and then i can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! __eou__ i don ’ t understand . you ’ re buying and selling money ? __eou__ you got it ! just last night i made usd 150 ! __eou__ last night ? __eou__ yeah ! it ’ s a 24 hour market ! i had bought some rib earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so i made a split second decision and sold all my rib at an amazing bid ! i ’ __eou__ you ’ re kidding ! i ’ m on ! where do i sign up ?
sorry to bother you sir , but i have some bad news . __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ ve lost a lot of money ! __eou__ what do you mean ? what happened ? __eou__ there are many factors that weigh in , but nasdaq is down 200 points , the dow jones indicator also suffered ! our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . __eou__ how is this possible ? you are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__ i know sir ! we didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . on the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . we could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__ do what you have to do ! one other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . if they find out , it ’ s the end of this company !
are you ready to go to the bank ? __eou__ sure , what do you need to do there ? __eou__ there ’ s problem with my bank statement . there ’ s a mistake on it . i also need to withdraw some money form the atm . __eou__ i have to exchange some money . __eou__ that ’ s right . you ’ re going away next week . __eou__ i also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . there was a problem last week . __eou__ i have to pay my credit bill too . if i don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . __eou__ their interest rates are usually quite high . it ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest .
well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__ for sure ! i didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the us . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k ? __eou__ yeah , i know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__ that ’ s interesting and logical i guess . in my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__ that seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__ yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__ i ’ ve been thinking of doing that lately ! i don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money !
good morning , welcome to bank of the usa . how may i help you today ? __eou__ hi , i need to transfer some money to another account . it ’ s urgent . __eou__ okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? __eou__ no . i ’ ve never made a transfer before . __eou__ it ’ s alright , i will take you through the procedure . are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? __eou__ a company account . i need to pay a bill . __eou__ okay , i ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . __eou__ i have all the information in this folder . __eou__ well . you ’ ve come prepared.you have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . it ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . __eou__ oh , that ’ s such a relief . i didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . thank you so much . __eou__ it ’ s my pleasure .
hello , sir , may i help you ? __eou__ yes . i would like some information for requesting a loan . __eou__ very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . __eou__ i see . so let me get this straight . if i borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will i have to pay each month ? __eou__ it depends on how long you take to pay it back . if we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . this of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! __eou__ it sounds good but , there is just one problem . i have a terrible credit score . __eou__ that is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . __eou__ you know what ? i don ’ t really need the money . thanks anyways !

i love your little lulu dolls.how much for a batch of 6,000 ? __eou__ for a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . __eou__ that ’ s a little steep for our company.do you offer any discounts ? __eou__ well , we ’ d like to work with you . if you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . can you increase your order to 15,000 ? __eou__ hmmm.it wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.how much of a discount would that give us ? __eou__ for order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . __eou__ so , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? that still might be a little hard.couldn ’ t you discount it further ? we ’ ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might __eou__ we do value your business . i think i can offer a further discount – say 5 % ? __eou__ i think we can handle that . let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow .

i ’ m so frustrated ! __eou__ what ’ s wrong , jim ? __eou__ i called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what i wanted ! __eou__ twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? __eou__ yes.they have some sort of digital receptionist.so when i called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department i wanted to be transferred to . __eou__ oh , i hate getting voicemail instead of a person.what did you do ? __eou__ i just kept pushing buttons . i was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . __eou__ couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? __eou__ eventually i did get to a real person . i found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed !

i understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.that ' s what you think , yes ? __eou__ yes . you could use five or six units.but five or six wouldn't be very efficient . i recommend seven . __eou__ and if we take the decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? __eou__ let me calculate the price for you . i can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.let ' s see here . your total would be 5929 dollars . __eou__ isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__ as i said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . i think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__ that's too much . we need to use the separate units , i guess . __eou__ it's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.your customers won't even notice them . __eou__ so you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . __eou__ yes , that's for the units.installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.but it depends on the time spent , of course . __eou__ you mean installation isn't included ? i'm very surprised . __eou__ no , ma'am . installation isn't included.the price i quoted was just for the units . __eou__ in taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.they don't charge extra . __eou__ i know that , ma'am . but they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.here in l . a . , installation is charged separately . __eou__ yes , i suppose i should get used to it.but i'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.we haven't even opened yet . __eou__ i understand , ma'am . __eou__ and the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . __eou__ it's a question of quality , ma'am . at that price , you would not get good equipment . i've been in this business for almost twenty years . i know what happens.if you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . __eou__ i will tell you what i can agree to.if you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , i can accept . __eou__ well . __eou__ you do seem like a better company than the other one.so i am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . but i won't pay more than 6000 . __eou__ well , we don't usually do it , but ... i believe we can accommodate you on this.we will do the installation for free . because we appreciate your business . __eou__ good . i hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible .

welcome to the company . we are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . __eou__ that's easy . it was your office ergonomics that decided me . __eou__ you're kidding ! something as simple as that ? __eou__ yes . it is very important to me . my mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . i have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and i know that t __eou__ yes , there has been a lot of research into rsi's . something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? __eou__ yes , i noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . __eou__ well , welcome to the team .
have you had a chance to look over the contract ? __eou__ yes . i've read it carefully . __eou__ and do you have any questions ? __eou__ no . but the contract stipulates that i will teach 22 hours a week.will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? __eou__ no , probably not . for the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . __eou__ but my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.will you pay me that much for the first month ? because , i mean , i won't be working so many hours . __eou__ i understand . that's why i didn't write the date on the contract.for the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.when you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.is that alright with you ? __eou__ oh , so i don't sign the contract today . is that right ? __eou__ i don't want you to misunderstand , miss briggs.we are very serious about hiring you . we want you to teach for us.we usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . __eou__ i can accept that . __eou__ good . and your benefits will begin immediately . __eou__ even my health insurance ? __eou__ yes . we will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.and your free membership in the club starts today if you like . __eou__ i have a few questions about the free membership . __eou__ what would you like to know ? __eou__ is my membership the same as paying club members ? i mean , can i get discounts at club hotels ? __eou__ absolutely . the only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . __eou__ what are bar vouchers ? __eou__ paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.the vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.but we don't offer vouchers to employees . __eou__ but according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . __eou__ that's right . so in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.you get more benefits than they do . __eou__ so , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.but we won't sign it yet . that right ? __eou__ yes . i've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.so that you understand the terms . __eou__ i understand.and according to the terms on the contract , i am happy to accept this job . i look forward to it . __eou__ i'm very pleased . we look forward to having you here , miss briggs .
i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? __eou__ oh no ! evaluations ! you can tell that's not my favorite job ; i haven't even started yet . when is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? __eou__ well , you do still have three weeks . but remember the employee must sign them , too . filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__ i never know how to rate the employees ' work . of course attendance and productivity are easy , i just look at the sales figures . __eou__ so it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__ exactly ! attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__ i suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . it's a great starting point for discussion __eou__ great idea . and after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . i almost can't wait to give it a try .

mr . smith , i have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than i am c __eou__ what are you basing this information on ? __eou__ first and secondary research . i hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . __eou__ yes , i will.we are very happy with your performance and want to continue our woodworking relationship . __eou__ i wish the same . as such , i hope you will seriously consider a pay increase . __eou__ let me take this up with the director and get back to you immediately .
so , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? __eou__ i've got several good reasons . i've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and i've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than i do . __eou__ salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__ well , i've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__ those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . also , some employees receive sales commissions . so good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__ that's understandable . well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . surely you've noticed the extra hours i've put in recently ? __eou__ i see your point . however , it might be hard to get a raise approved . profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget __eou__ that would be very good of you , mr . white .

good morning . how can i help you ? __eou__ i'd like to open a new account . __eou__ have you filled out an application form ? __eou__ yes . and i've brought some documents along with me , too . do you need to see my passport ? __eou__ yes . i'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? __eou__ yes . does the checking account come with a debit card ? __eou__ yes . actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in atm machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . __eou__ that's very convenient . __eou__ it is . our customers really like it . do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? __eou__ yes . what's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? __eou__ the maximum is $ 1000 . __eou__ is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? __eou__ yes , but it's not much . you just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . it's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . __eou__ that's true . is everything alright with my documents ? __eou__ they're all in order . if you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . __eou__ thank you very much . __eou__ you're welcome .
